Thanks for the homework!</p> <p>Let me start with your last question first: anyone approaching this problem without an intersectional sensibility is gonna have a bad time. That's true in general about any problem, but triply so in this case because companies rarely advertise their unethical behavior[1], frequently have excellent PR teams, and are pretty damn mediocre on average[2].</p> <p>Beyond that, many of the public data sources that track these things are run by underfunded nonprofits. They often produce excellent, narrowly scoped resources (like Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate lawbreaking and OSHA violations) but the data they produce is usually too laggy to be decision-relevant.</p> <p>We want/need to know about issues before we read about them in the paper. Otherwise our clients get hurt. So the first line of defense is building, enriching, and interrelating our own internal dataset on the ~10,000 companies we could plausibly buy shares in.</p> <p>We've got explicit exclusions in place on 3,000 of them. Roughly two thirds of those exclusions come from groups like BDS, AFSC, etc. The rest wound up on that list through our own research in one way or another, usually because of something that turned out to be relatively minor after the whole story came out.</p> <p>A long way of saying: it pays to treat smoke like fire when you're trying to screen out bad actors. Our official screening criteria enumerates a couple dozen reasons we'd deem a company uninvestable for conduct or product-related reasons, but the fact that they've actively harming living things unifies all of those factors. So if a company harms living things in a way that's not on my list, I update the list.</p> <p>Investors who are focused only on divestment might stop there. After all, they've still got 7,000 companies to choose from. So when they reach that stage, they'll generally buy a sample of the remaining companies and move on with their lives.</p> <p>In my view, that's a pitiful approach. Not having a reason to exclude them is not the same as having a reason to buy them. So at this stage in the research process, we shift our focus towards looking for companies that generate some kind of positive impact the same way that they generate revenue, which narrows the field down even further[3].</p> <p>We own less than 40 securities in total, and that's been pretty constant for the whole time we've been in business (since sep 2021). Our flagship strategy for long-term investors owns less than 20, and if I had more time to spend researching we'd probably own even fewer of them. Great companies don't come along that often, so if I'm lucky enough to find one I buy it and hold on.</p> <p>Anyway, your question was how I deal with living in the grey area that necessarily results when trying to keep one's involvements ethical.</p> <p>Part of the answer is obviously \"i have a process.\" But a bigger part is that I know I'm currently wrong about at least 15% of the companies I think are ethical. Corporations always have, and always will find new and interesting ways to disappoint us.</p> <p>But I try to think about these things like my garden, which has invasive weeds now and probably will forever. If I were to knowingly cultivate those weeds I'd be an asshole. But if I can get to a place where they can't sneak up on me the same way twice, that's winning.</p> <p>To your other questions:</p> <p>1) The single best place to start looking into any given public company (for any reason) is their most recent form 10k or 10q, which you can get for free (from the SEC) here. Item 1a of both forms is a section called \"risk factors,\" where the company is legally required to enumerate all material risks they are exposed to. Whether they're getting sued, facing employee walkouts, or whatever, it will be there beneath a thin layer of legalese... often long before it's in the news. More to come on that one after we get our new website in a few weeks. In the meantime, you might dig (this podcast episode)[https://freemoneypodcast.com/p/divestment-without-dissonance] we did a few months ago about divestment at universities. There's some good discussion about what's lost by focusing just on divestment.</p> <p>2) If I could afford the lawyers, I would open source my data in a second. But that invites compliance issues that I don't really have the ability to contend with right now. I would never give up being a fiduciary and a registered investment adviser -- and I'm glad to be held to that standard -- but it means I have to be wary about putting out anything that could be understood as investment advice.[4]</p> <p>[1] Unless they're in cahoots with an apartheid state, naturally. Clocking zionist clowns is trivial relative to figuring out if a nursing home is doing elder abuse or whatever. [2] Most 51.6%of the ~30k stocks that were publicly traded in the US from 1925 to 2023 had negative returns over their whole history. And that's not an outlier. ~2.4% of stocks generated all of the returns investors experienced globally between 1990 and 2020. [3] Always important to note that \"positive impact\" is intangible and inherently not comparable. I own (and am currently wearing) Crocs, which has an unambiguous case for positive impact in my view... show me another fashionable shoe that actually helps my bunions and I'll eat it. It's a small position these days, but I always feel like I have to underline that good change usually comes in unexpected and overlooked packages.

Be nice. The date is approximate, and\u00a0clearly I was (am) a huge nerd. I've included scans of it in\u00a0handwritten form as well. We were given 25 minutes to respond to a quotation. </p> <p>The\u00a0one I received was from President Abraham Lincoln: \"Folks are usually as happy as they make up their minds to be.\" </p> <p>There is a perceptible flaw in the argument that happiness is controllable. This argument says that one\u2019s mental state rests entirely in the hands of the person in question. The simplicity of this argument and its apparent unassailability disguise the statement\u2019s true nature, which merely describes one circumstance in a full spectrum of possibility.</p> <p>Paul Erdos, a brilliant mathematician, once tried to find a formulaic way of expressing the outcome of a social circumstance. He came up with the mathematical statement that Happiness equals Reality over Expected Reality.</p> <p>H = R / E</p> <p>This is far from being an unassailable formula, but one can see that if either the variable (E) or (R) is close to zero, an off-the-charts result will come.</p> <p>A circumstance where E was zero would be a complete surprise. Any value of R would give back an undefined result. Therefore (at least mathematically speaking) a surprise would result in complete happiness.</p> <p>A circumstance where (R) is zero would result in an abject lack of happiness (H=0). This circumstance lies outside of the subject\u2019s control.</p> <p>Of the three variables in the equation any person can only hope to achieve true control over (E). This means that one can only hope to keep one\u2019s expectations down in relation to an event. There is no control over reality.</p> <p>Therefore, the statement which here states that happiness is controllable and subject only to an individual is flawed.</p> <p>Happiness depends on two variables, one of which is not controllable. The statement that one can make up one\u2019s mind to be happy is not a truism, but instead a description of a circumstance.</p> <p>It is true that one can contribute to the overall mental picture. Meds, after all control one out of two variables that dictate our mental state. This explains the observation used to support the theory that we can decide to be happy. In a situation where we can have the same experience, R would be a constant. Variable E would fluctuate from person to person. Thus, the same experience could yield different levels of happiness.</p> <p>Therefore, happiness is in some cases a choice. There is no way to compensate for a disappointing reality, though Lincoln\u2019s statement accurately describes a circumstance where reality never disappoints. It is unassailable in that it describes a position of a greater truth. Happiness is not an accident, but not entirely a choice.</p> <p></p> <p></p>","tags":["eclectica","happiness"]},{"location":"blog/2008/09/23/a-trans-woman-in-the-subway/","title":"A Trans Woman In the Subway","text":"<p>I came across this remarkable piece from my first semester in college when I was going through my old college stuff. It's problematic, but really interesting. I was so hung up on binary ideas of gender that I came damn close to siding\u00a0with the transphobic hecklers. </p> <p>I\u2019ve never been mugged in the subway, or actually ever really been threatened, except for one time. It wasn\u2019t even really me that was being threatened (I didn\u2019t do anything), but when anybody threatens anybody in a subway car, everybody feels threatened. The two yellow-orange-yellow-orange benches sit too close to each other for the temporary residents not to feel a sense of shared space.\u00a0</p> <p>Anyway, this was after one of the best nights of my life, around 4:30 in the morning. I had sung drinking songs with new friends, gone to my favorite restaurant with old ones, and met a girl I was sweet on. Perhaps best of all, I had remembered to charge my music player for the 35 minute ride back to bed. With pizza grease still present on my unshaven chin, I dug through my music library, lusting for a little bit of Wynton Marsalis. My lust sated, I proceeded to wipe the grease off my chin and wait impatiently for the soon-arriving subway.</p> <p>I sat down in an almost empty car, slid my butt down so that my shoulder blades were resting low on the back of the bench, and switched on some rap music. I rode in peace for two stops, until a group of drunken 16 year olds got on and sat directly across me. It seemed this was one of their first experiences out on the town in Manhattan: their eyes were bloodshot against their dark skin, and they could barely sit up straight. The girls were flirting with each other and with the boys, who were cracking racist jokes at the expense of everyone but themselves, they had arrived at Koreans when another passenger boarded.</p> <p>Her broad shoulders spoke of her birth of a male, her five o\u2019clock shadow reminded everyone that she was still one, yet without the stubble she might appear as a woman to an untrained eye.\u00a0</p> <p>Those who walk the streets of Manhattan are trained, though. These young men and women knew immediately when she walked in, and greeted her with choruses of \u201coh shit\u201d. They were laughing so hard that their feet rarely touched the ground.\u00a0</p> <p>This was real real; visceral, belly-aching laughter. She wasn\u2019t happy. She started pacing back and forth, her gait betraying her masculinity. She walked from one side to the other in about one and a half strides, the awkward half-step only infuriating her as the peanut gallery sitting across from her exploded into a fresh torrent of laughter. She stepped, half stepped, turned around, stepped, half stepped until the laughter was too much. She stopped, planted her feet wide and bent her knees. She had a knife.

Wrap the rubber band tightly around the ski\u2019s brakes to ensure easy access to the edges, Then screw your ski into the vice securely.</p> <p>It is best to think of the ski as having two edges; one which is along the flat base of the ski and the other on the narrow side of the ski. The two edges must be sharpened individually to ensure a good tune.\u00a0</p> <p>The area of the ski which we will be sharpening begins about four inches from the bottom of the ski and ends about five to seven inches from the tip of the ski. It is important not to over sharpen, because an over sharp ski will cause the skier to catch edges frequently.</p> <p>First, observe the edges of your ski. Are the edges rusted or dirty? Rust and dirt spots should be cleaned with the gummi stone, which will remove the offending pieces without damaging your expensive files or diamond stones.</p> <p>Once the dirt/rust is removed, place your mill bastard file securely into your file guide. Place the file on the edge of your ski near the tip and move slowly towards the tail. Be sure to keep the pressure you apply constant. Especially when tuning new skis, it is normal to have a lot of steel come off of the ski edge during this first step. Repeat this step 4 or 5 times, until the ski edge has a uniform sheen.</p> <p>Clean your file off with your iron brush and insert your file into your side edge guide. Perform the same motion as before along the side of the ski. Be sure to apply uniform pressure to the guide to ensure an even tune.</p> <p>Repeat the same process of sharpening the bottom and side edge with the diamond stones. Once you have completed the process with the extra-sharp stone, you must check the edge\u2019s sharpness. The best way is to place your thumbnail against the side of the edge and quickly move it against the edge. A small amount of your thumbnail should come off. If a sizeable amount comes off, pass the gummi stone over both edges of the ski to remove some of the sharpness.</p> <p>Sharp skis are essential to enjoying a good day at the mountains. If you follow the steps above, you will be able to count on five to ten days of precision turning and increased edge hold. If these steps are followed regularly, you will notice an increase in the performance of your skis over time.</p> <p>If you liked this, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["skiing","college of idaho"]},{"location":"blog/2008/10/09/madison/","title":"Madison","text":"<p>I wrote this in my first semester at the College of Idaho. </p> <p>\u201cCan I interview you for a paper\u201d?

The assumption is often that those from urban areas are somehow \u201cout of touch\u201d with core American values, or somehow corrupted by some evil core of any big city. Similarly, people from small towns are often much maligned by urbanites because they are assumed to be simple and unintelligent.</p> <p>Perhaps both assumptions are true, perhaps neither. We do know for sure that urban centers tend to be more liberal while rural areas tend to be more conservative. Although there are instances of urban poverty and rural wealth, we can effectively generalize about the economic character of these areas: in general, urban dwellers are much better off since they benefit from more economic exchange.</p> <p>It is both inaccurate and unfair to generalize further about these areas, however. There are urban libertarians and rural socialists, morally bankrupt cowboys and saintly cab drivers. Perhaps the best way to tackle the question of which is \u201cbetter\u201d is to approach it from the standpoint of which one is more beneficial to the greater world.</p> <p>Strictly from a standpoint of conservation, it is almost inarguably beneficial to have people living in large cities. The improved public transportation, recycling, and waste systems alone allow for a much lower-impact way of living. Frequent interaction between people of different races and social classes tends to lead to more tolerant citizens or at least more aware citizens. Further, cities develop a higher concentration of intellectuals, who will tend to support others and beget a culture of intellectualism. The value of this culture of intellectualism is almost incalculable.</p> <p>Small towns, however \u201cinefficient\u201d will generally have a higher quality of life. Pollution is generally lower, homes more interspersed, and crime significantly less noticeable. People tend to know more people, because small and friendly communities will beget a growing web of acquaintances in a way that a harsh city will not. The issue with these small and tighter-knit communities is that their citizens can tend to be less exposed to cultural diversity and lack a broad world identity. Many people who have moved from big cities, however, have come to call small towns home.</p> <p>Perhaps there is a mix between our need to move to a big city to self educate and our desire to move to a small town to relax and feel at home that might be found. I feel perfectly happy receiving mail in both a small town in Idaho and the largest city in America (New York City). Perhaps there is some interplay between small town values and big city diversity that makes America work, some necessary ebb and flow between the megalopolis and mom-and-pop-olis that begets a more successful America and a happier citizen.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["economic geography"]},{"location":"blog/2008/11/20/stories/","title":"Stories","text":"<p>I wrote this in my first semester at the College of Idaho. Be nice. </p> <p>I remember the first time that I began to think I might be a \u201cPeople\u201d person. The distinction between a \u201cpeople\u201d person and a non-people person is of course ridiculous \u2013 are there people who aren\u2019t also people? \u2013 But commonly, one thinks of a people person as one who likes to interact with others.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a people person in the way that the term is often bandied about: I don\u2019t like to meet hundreds of people for the sheer thrill of remembering how their face looks and what their name is. My favorite thing is to hear their stories. There\u2019s something magical in a story that a stranger tells you. Your narrator is completely unreliable \u2013 but unlike literature \u2013 he or she is completely scrutable.</p> <p>A book and a box led me to this realization. The box was a multicolored, ten human sized box operated by an outfit called storycorps in New York City\u2019s Grand Central Station. Literally, it was a box where you would take your grandmother and talk. With the aid of a trained \u201chelper\u201d you would ask her questions that were recorded onto the public record. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this project is that there is no arbiter of what constitutes a valid story and what doesn\u2019t. The stories are as frequently about how great aunt Bessie used to make the best apple pies as they are about the time that granny went to see FDR\u2019s Inauguration when she was just a little girl. This reinforced to me that anyone can be a storyteller, and that given the opportunity, they would talk your ear off.</p> <p>The second prompt was a book of photos and stories, called \u201cHarvey Wang\u2019s New York\u201d. The book is a collection without plot, sort of a love letter to iconic New Yorkers: They had pictures of the guy who had been running the cyclone on Coney Island for forty-two years. There was this adorable old lady who sold seashells on the upper west side and a waspy woman with huge hair who tells people where to go in the New York public library. The stories of these people made up the fabric of the city I lived in at the time, and after Harvey Wang came to our classroom and explained how easy it was to write the book, I realized that almost anyone can gain access to this fabric if they just ask.</p> <p>After I realized those two things, I got really annoying for at least a couple of years. I would ask to sit next to people at pizza joints and start talking at them, Most of the time I would get friendly stories in return, but sometimes I would just get blank New Yorker stares. I met Sol Moscot, an optician who is the son of an optician named Sol Moscot. I met Greeks who had lived in Astoria for forty years, and who would tell me how great America was through contrast with Greece excitedly using their young nieces and nephews as interpreters. They had never learned English. I met an African American hairdresser who invited me to hang out in her shop and invited my friend (a white Texan) to get cornrows. She gladly accepted.</p> <p>I realized that I\u2019m slowly working on my own world: the collection of people that I get to know over time and their collected stories, visages, and thoughts. I hope that the majority of the stories are the kind where immigrants tell me about their lives, rather than the kind where Texans get cornrows.

I have been throwing up almost all day. My palms are sweaty; I\u2019m carrying a half-eaten loaf of bread (the only thing I had been able to eat). It does not feel like I\u2019ve just gotten out of college after six exhausting weeks. It feels like I\u2019ve been the Guinea pig in a government experiment, followed by scientists furiously taking notes.</p> <p>My friend Matt had kindly offered to let me stay at his house over mid-semester break. I had gladly accepted \u2013 excited to see what life was like in North Idaho and anxious to spend a precious week away from the friendly confines of the College of Idaho\u2019s Caldwell campus.</p> <p>Now, after an unfortunately timed illness and a long plane ride punctuated by a neighbor who would not shut up about how much money he had made buying houses with subprime mortgages, I found myself about to meet matt\u2019s girlfriend and shortly after, his family. I was not feeling entirely sociable.</p> <p>Shortly after we had driven across the Idaho state border to his house, I was sitting on my borrowed bed, ready to go to sleep. I looked out the window on the skyline of Post Falls, Idaho and couldn\u2019t help but compare it to the view of New Jersey from my mom\u2019s apartment in New York. Jersey Never twinkles the same way that Post falls does at night \u2013 the flat land and lack of other light make each and every light switch a tapping foot, working in concert to form a staccato rhythm resonating out into the night sky.</p> <p>A day later, I found myself at the helm of an ancient ford f-350 superdeisel in matt\u2019s front yard. I was listening to Country music because (as I had learned) country music is the only thing on most radios that is still intelligible over the drone of a chainsaw in close proximity. My job was to wait until the tree\u2019s trunk is sufficiently weakened, so that I can use the truck\u2019s four wheel drive to pull it over. It\u2019s a simple job, but one I manage to fail at more often than not. I learned slowly that trucks don\u2019t like to be driven with the emergency brake on.</p> <p>After we managed to fell the tree, I grabbed my smaller chainsaw out of the back and began to cut branches off. Wielding a chainsaw gives trees a whole new and much more impermanent presence. Matt and I relieve the tree of its branches in five short minutes before cutting up the tree\u2019s trunk and moving on to clear out young saplings from the rear quarters of his ranch.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the trees are evenly spaced\u201d he says as he indicates five, six, seven trees that I should cut down \u201cthis way we can protect against this whole forest going up in flames.\u201d At first, it\u2019s a tough sell to me that killing trees is actually beneficial to trees, but it begins to make sense once I imagine myself in the middle of a burning forest. The floor of the forest is thickly coated with dried pine needles, and would swiftly ignite with any provocation, since there is not much rain up here and the needles are almost an inch thick on the ground. It\u2019s not hard to imagine this quickly becoming a carpet of fire.</p> <p>As I cull the herd of its weaker members, the imagined fire is much less damaging, especially since we are also lopping off the lower branches of the trees. Likely, the gravest impact that flame will have on this ranch is to scar the trunks of several trees and expose the topsoil to the elements, since the carpet of pine needles will inevitably burn off.</p> <p>I am beginning to see that this selective thinning is entirely necessary to protect both the forest and the family who lives in a house a short distance from the forest. Further, after bringing innumerable trees to an early doom, I am beginning to feel the hunger within my person begin to reverberate. Matt is hungry too, we drive back to the house and call that day\u2019s chores quits.</p> <p>Later on that night, I am told that I have chanced to arrive on the night of Matt\u2019s older brother\u2019s birthday. There is to be a large family dinner later that night. In the leadup to dinner, I am a curiosity. Matt\u2019s family seems convinced that their particular brand of living \u2013 to maintain your land yourself, to ask guests to work for their supper \u2013 is so insane as to be repulsive to visitors. They principally cite the example of the last person who went up to their house for the first break of his freshman year, who did not set foot there again until Matt\u2019s brother got married\u2026a short four years later.</p> <p>As it came to be close to dinnertime, it was interesting to see how people focused exactly on what they were interested. Matt\u2019s little brother scurried about ensuring that the potatoes were hot and the napkins were well adjusted. Matt excitedly played with his little cousin (the only girl in the local unit of their family) while his mother attempted to bring a semblance of order to the kitchen.</p> <p>Finally, we sat down to eat. I sat at the children\u2019s table and we all joined hands for what I anticipated would be a standard grace. About twelve millionths of a second into a grace that was both nonstandard and jarringly well memorized, I realized both that I was far, far away from home and that a family which was so sure of its extreme dysfunctionality was indeed highly functional. They had successfully put together a large family gathering without conflagration; a rare feat for any family, and they were showing their support for each other in a way that is admirable in modern times. As I sat silently though their grace (which was sung in harmony), I reflected on this and wondered how I would have turned out had my family sung grace at dinner each day. As I finished that thought, a lull came in the grace which I mistook for the ending. I sat down and began to eat, while the family sang \u201cAmen\u201d three times and I burst out laughing. Matt\u2019s older brother looked over at me and said \u201cMaybe next time we\u2019ll say Jewish grace\u201d</p>","tags":["college of idaho","creative nonfiction"]},{"location":"blog/2009/03/12/when-the-internet-becomes-my-internet/","title":"When \"The Internet\" Becomes \"My Internet\"","text":"<p>This is an incomplete \"free write\" from journalism class at the College of Idaho. </p> <p>In the beginning, the internet was very much a dynamic, wild-wild-west sort of place.

It was originally untitled, but my irony-free usage of \"The\u00a0Social Media\" in it made the right title obvious in retrospect. </p> <p>Media pundits often speak breathlessly about the ongoing democratization of our world because of the increasing involvement of the \u201cJoe the plumbers\u201d of the world. The phenomenon through which they have come to be involved has been referred to as \u201cgrassroots\u201d or \u201ccitizen\u201d journalism: a process by which citizens are actively involved in the creation and editing of online news stories through the ability to comment, filter, and create/share substantially anything they want.\u00a0</p> <p>I have participated in this phenomenon through \u201csocial media\u201d websites like Digg.com and Reddit.com, where I have long been voting on stories in an effort to collaborate with my fellow users to bring the stories most relevant to our microcosm of society to the front page. The intersection of opinions about what news is most relevant can lead to interesting problems.</p> <p>When I first got started using the social media, it was through digg.com, which was at that time a relatively small community of likeminded users. I found the vast majority of the news stories to be relevant because its combination of important social news and irreverent internet jokes appealed to the eighteen year old, slightly pimplier version of me.</p> <p>Digg.com started to become less appealing to me as its user base started to grow unwieldy. Since Digg\u2019s user structure depends on users discussing and voting on issues for one front page. There is only one front page, so the interests of the community must be quite relevant to one another in order to give a relevant experience to the whole userbase. As the site continually grew, the friendly community of eighteen year old boys laughing at funny pictures of animals and learning about the Austrian school of economics swiftly became an online red light district. With each incremental user, Digg took a step down an inexorable path to become an Obama/Ron Paul/repetitive joke machine. \u00a0I started to grow dissatisfied as Digg grew into an online times square: a big place so actively purporting to be hip that one cannot help but be repulsed.</p> <p>As my revulsion grew, I began looking for sites which had similar functionality but a method to control the overwhelming number of users on a site. After much searching, I found reddit.com, a site which allows the user to subscribe to various news feeds in specific subject areas. The website then concatenates those various news feeds into a single feed, which effectively displays a great deal of information that is relevant to my interests, while still being edited by a small group of relatively sane individuals.</p> <p>This forum allows for both insightful and irreverent discussion of the articles, as well as an ability to comment on Reddit rather than the underlying site in order to discuss the story in a more back-and-forth way than by simply posting a reaction on the website and seeing what happens. The reddit/digg manner of interaction also allows for the posting of \u201canti-news\u201d, as in the revelation of irresponsible coverage of news reporting or the non-coverage of an event.</p> <p>The social media has helped me not just because it steers me towards \u201cthe best\u201d article in any particular news cycle, but also because it has the capability to bring stories to our attention that would not normally find themselves headline news on network TV: stories like a group of anonymous internet users collaborating online to catch a pedophile, or the Pope\u2019s continuing non-action in sending condoms to Africa.

He went on to win the 2009 Forex Trading\u00a0World Cup that year in addition to writing a number of features for the Sunday Times of London. Two months after we spoke, he published one with a nice vignette about my dad. </p> <p>At the beginning of this conversation, he shared an anecdote\u00a0with me about informally advising an actress on when to swap currencies while she sold a house in France and bought one in England. </p> <p>To look at the example of the actress that you mentioned, it seems as if there doesn't seem to be much of anything that can get her to look at news rationally except for somehow making her into some form of trader. Is doing this as simple as involving former bankers and hedgers in the news media, or are there other steps that you would recommend be taken?</p> <p>Turning her into a trader wasn't difficult. I told her how she would feel before she felt it.</p> <p>I explained that the panic she would experience in a few days' time was part of the process by which markets work, and that she had to endure feeling sick with anxiety before she could be rewarded with higher prices -- and that there was another actress, or at least another human being, who was going through the same emotions in mirror image while trying to achieve the opposite transaction, i.e., one who wished to sell a house in England and to buy one in France, while our actress wished to buy a house in England and sell one in France.\u00a0</p> <p>The actress panicked when she was supposed to, despite being prepared for what would happen. But she trusted the explanation enough to wait. Each day I gave her price levels that would mean all was well, and price levels that would mean all was not. She watched the markets on her laptop, not daring to go out. In the end, I think she actually enjoyed the experience, because it gave her an understanding and a feeling of control. And she got her price.</p> <p>As a follow up, how might one avoid the \"Cramer Problem\", where a former hedge fund manager makes the transition to being a journalist, but gives wide-ranging advice that is more designed to entertain than enlighten? Do journalistic organizations seeking to overcome this problem simply need to ignore the \"Mad Money\" audience? Can they do this and remain solvent?</p> <p>I can't speak for CNBC, but in British broadsheet newspapers, the desire to entertain has been met in more wholesome ways.\u00a0</p> <p>The Money section of The Sunday Times, for example, probably gives as much space to publicising the scams of banks and of financial companies as it does to investment themes, so that the reader is \"entertained\" by being made to feel angry. Arguably there is a strong public-interest justification in these stories.\u00a0</p> <p>This is not a phenomenon of the credit crisis, by the way:\u00a0the Money section, which -- unlike the Business section --\u00a0is aimed at a general audience, has always been quite sceptical. It's probably one-third to one-half investment advice, and one-third consumer advice, while a sixth of the section entertains readers by, for example, interviewing a celebrity about the most satisfying moments and the biggest mistakes in their personal finances. There's also a columnist who is mean with money, and happens to be married to someone he loves but regards as profligate. He's always saving cash; she's always\u00a0spending it. It's quite funny.</p> <p>Coming from the standpoint of protecting investors from hazy information that they might receive, could you support conceptually the establishment of a test to see who was capable of trading individual stocks and bonds (as distinct from vanilla mutual funds)? Can you think of anything that you would want to put on such a test?</p> <p>Such a test might have perverse consequences.\u00a0</p> <p>If you require people to pass a test before they can trade, you drive them into the arms of professionals, who might perform no better (but charge fees for the privilege). For those who pass the test, the danger is false confidence. Where would you draw the line? Would you ask a tenant to pass a test before allowing them to buy a house, for example?</p> <p>I can see a case for requiring a test before trading on margin, however. It's leverage that destroys lives.</p> <p>Is improving the quality of financial journalism more a question of improving the quality of reportage at the highest levels by involving experts or instead one of improving the level of discourse at the lowest level to educate a greater number of market participants? If you were the editor of a business section and had to choose which of these two to emphasize, which would it be? Why?</p> <p>It would be both.\u00a0</p> <p>I'd start by hiring reporters who understand companies, economies and the markets. Without that, you've got no business section and without a business section you don't have a proper newspaper. So, an editor has to give that priority. Then I'd establish a separate section, similar to the Sunday Times Money section, to educate the widest audience. By having two sections, you can publish material for a sophisticated audience in the Business section without intimidating the general audience. The two constituencies\u00a0are equally important. Finally, I'd save some money from my budget to hire hedgies and ex-bankers as business columnists. These are columnists, not reporters. If there were no money left in the pot, I'd persuade them to do it for nothing (but they would not be allowed to \"talk their book\").\u00a0</p> <p>Their job is to educate the sophisticated audience (in the Business, not the Money section) with real-time analysis from a trader's viewpoint, because traders think differently from reporters.</p> <p>When you were a \"budding\" trader, how did you navigate the transition from amateur to professional? What resources did you utilize? Are there ways you can conceive of to make these resources publicly available?</p> <p>That's a long story.\u00a0</p> <p>There are\u00a0thousands of\u00a0legitimate ways to trade, and would-be traders face a quest to find what is right for them. In the end, I took some academic work from the 1930s, which I came across by chance, and combined it with profit-driven work on technical analysis in the 1990s. Then I adapted both to suit the way my mind works. Much of the trading literature remains useful for generations, because it is not really about trading at all. It's about human nature, which does not change.</p> <p>Trading is mostly control of your own psychology.

With the remodel of Simplot completed and the remodel of Hayman underway, it\u2019s beginning to look like a much newer campus. \u00a0Andy Erstad is one particular charioteer of change: \u201cI\u2019m excited that the school has taken a very proactive approach to upgrades and management of resources that go into operating the facilities.\u201d</p> <p>There have certainly been exogenous factors in the campus\u2019 push towards sustainability. Erstad posits that \u201cThe run-up in the cost of energy really highlighted the potential beneficial outcomes of being smart and doing conscientious smart planning both in master planning of the campus facilities and in the actual building design and implementation.\u201d There are real costs associated with operating a campus, especially, laboratory buildings and science buildings. According to Erstad, \u201cthe costs are doubling\u201d.</p> <p>The seeds of sustainable practices have been germinating for a long time, however. Erstad notes that \u201cyou have this sort of industry movement already going on and then you have this exclamation point of a very real energy spike (cost spike).\u201d The benefits of building new buildings or renovating existing ones are often more than simply aesthetic. Erstad thinks \u201cpeople started to say \u2018Wow, you know we\u2019ve been hearing about this all these years, now we get to see the real impact of it.\u2019 And where a building designed and built fifteen years ago may cost a hundred thousand dollars a year to run in energy and utility costs. That same building built today may take fifty-five or fifty thousand dollars to run.\u201d</p> <p>Aesthetics and experiences do matter though, and Erstad believes that there are habits that can change to both assist us fiscally but also to improve our relationships with the land. One such way is \u201cUtilizing [campus as an] outside living classroom if you will. And that type of approach while it\u2019s very sustainable and green\u2026is also a fabulous teaching tool to bring college students, faculty, and staff in line or aware of their environment and aware of opportunities to be stewards of the land and stewards of the facilities.\u201d</p> <p>There are certainly financial constraints involved in bringing the college forward and more towards sustainable practices. Erstad notes that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t really take every single building and afford to do a complete sustainability overhaul\u2026on each of them due to cost. As the college is looking at upgrading and making improvements to various buildings, they are seizing these opportunities to do the right thing. Increase the efficiencies, add different types of lighting: The new lighting technologies, the new energy management technologies, and the new heating and air conditioning technologies where they can.\u201d \u00a0The college has been particularly forward-looking in this according to Erstad, who notes \u201cas every opportunity arises the College has been taking those situations and trying to increase the energy efficiency, increase the mechanical and electrical efficiencies, get a leg up wherever they can.\u201d</p> <p>Erstad is happy to share his enthusiasm for the way that the college has handled its campus. \u201cThey\u2019re seriously focused on doing the right thing\u2026I appreciate that mindful of the budgets and the cost implications I think it\u2019s still the right thing to do\u2026.In the long run, the savings are tremendous, and particularly in college buildings, classroom facilities, science laboratories which have a huge energy consumption component. This Is one of the ways that the school takes a very responsible role in leveraging every dollar that they have to the highest possible extent.\u201d</p>","tags":["college of idaho","profiles"]},{"location":"blog/2009/04/21/minyan-makes-markets-manageable/","title":"Minyan Makes Markets Manageable","text":"<p>This is from a paper I wrote at the College of Idaho.</p> <p>Minyanville.com made it possible for me to be conversant about financial issues.\u00a0</p> <p>I remember discovering the site about two weeks into my first internship on Wall Street. I had been tasked with monitoring a status screen and told to continually read the news to help my own understanding. When I first started attempting to understand the machination of the Wall Street beat by reading the New York Times business section and Reuters financial news, I felt like I was drowning. \u00a0</p> <p>My parents (both corporate finance geeks) had taught me phrases like EBITDA and revenue at a young age. My friends assumed I knew about these things, and would sometimes ask me questions about investment banking, trading, or business; assuming me to be an authority because I knew the names of more than five Wall Street firms.</p> <p>I found Minyanville by chance, and found Todd Harrison\u2019s writing there to be immensely helpful to my understanding. At first it was just his writing, but as I started exploring the site and tenaciously checking for updates, I found a collection of authors and thinkers who had devoted themselves to the craft of finance and were willing to share their experiences.</p> <p>Imagine me, eighteen years old, essentially dropping in like a fly on the wall and listening to a collection of the \u201ccool kids\u201d in the finance world talk about their craft with one another and an audience of thousands. \u00a0I was fortunate to both sit down with and chat over the phone with Todd (Toddo) recently, and he shared with me some musings about both the reasons for Minyanville\u2019s existence and the way that the general public interacts with the financial media.</p> <p>The Minyanville approach of providing opinion rather than advice comes clear after I ask Toddo if anyone actually understands the financial machination. He responds \u201cTo understand where we are we must appreciate how we got here. So I think that looking at the probability spectrum of what could occur and communicating the risks and rewards to all of the scenarios within a probability spectrum and offering an opinion in the context that it\u2019s just that (an opinion) is the greatest value add in the market place, as opposed to telling people what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed many have long been critical of those who offer advice to random audiences rather than opinions. In person, it\u2019s clear that Harrison believes there\u2019s very little merit in offering advice over the internet, since there is absolutely no way he could know the risk profile of his readership. Further to the point of offering advice without information he offers \u201cI think that\u2019s endemic of the mindset that got us into trouble in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Harrison offers that people should re-examine who they look to for their punditry, arguing that \u201cMany of the pundits that people are looking to for questions on when we\u2019re going to get out of this are the same people who didn\u2019t see I coming in the first place.\u201d This jives very well with a thought passed on by a friend in the asset management industry who offered that oftentimes, once people are validated as pundits in the media mainstream that it\u2019s very difficult to get rid of them. Indeed pundits who offered up investment recommendations that failed miserably one month are often back the next recommending new investments with little accountability for their past failings.</p> <p>On the subject of criticizing unaccountable pundits, there\u2019s not much more I can offer. There\u2019s already a closet industry built around criticizing CNBC. A point Toddo raises which I think is very thoughtful is that \u201cThere is a fair amount of culpability that extends throughout the societal spectrum. (It ranges) from the consumers who overextended on their credit to the financial institutions that engineered the markets to the policymakers who were complicit by acceptance to the CEO of the United States of America.\u201d He adds \u201cNobody was asking questions when the screens were green.\u201d</p> <p>Harrison is hesitant to point out too bluntly that he and many other Minyans were asking questions when the screens were green. It\u2019s been a good thing for me to have these guys as teachers, and to have their thoughts percolating in my brain.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["financial journalism","investor education","profiles"]},{"location":"blog/2010/04/20/recovery-from-the-financial-crisis/","title":"Recovery From the Financial Crisis","text":"<p>I wrote this essay for my Faith &amp; Critical Reasoning class at Fordham.

It was the first time\u00a0I'd really done much with it. </p> <p>John Milton\u2019s classic Paradise Lost and the book of genesis both display interesting linguistic patterns when parsed using modern textual analysis tools. The tool I have concentrated on to narrow the scope of this paper is the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for the Python programming language and its \u201cSimilar\u201d function.</p> <p>The similar function is capable of parsing a large text and returning other words that appear in a similar context throughout the book. For example, if I were to enter in the following code on a text that was comprised entirely of onomatopoetic dial tones:</p> <p>Example_Text.similar(\u201cbeep\u201d)</p> <p>I would receive output that looks like this:</p> <p>boop bip bop</p> <p>This means that the words \u201cBeep,\u201d \u201cboop,\u201d \u201cbip,\u201d and \u201cbeep\u201d appear in similar enough contexts for the computer to think there\u2019s more than a seventy percent probability that they mean the same thing.</p> <p>Obviously, this examination technique gets more interesting when it is applied to actual works, because there are some surprising results.</p> <p>Before diving into Milton and the Book of Genesis, it makes sense to take a further example to illustrate the validity of the function and its results. Along with the standard NLTK library comes a repository of millions of chat room conversations recorded in 2005. To anyone who\u2019s familiar with the \u201cfiller\u201d quality that words like \u201clol\u201d have in adolescent conversation, the result below will demonstrate the validity of this function\u2014each of the words below are used in chat rooms as \u201cempty\u201d pieces of speech:</p> <p>Text5.similar(\u201clol\u201d)</p> <p>Returns:\u00a0</p> <p>Hi Hey and hiya lmao ty well yeah hello oh ok all haha no what yes you</p> <p>Now, to the texts themselves. Let\u2019s focus on one of the key events of both stories\u2026the section focusing on Eve\u2019s appetite for fruit.</p> <p>The \u201csimilar\u201d function affords us an interesting way to make a journey through a text. If we begin by asking the algorithm to find words that are used similarly to \u201ceat,\u201d we receive:</p> <p>Be fear height in on place taste thee to accaron ades air Algiers all ambition apathy arioch as ascalon asp</p> <p>Removing place names (each of which only occur once, which confuses the algorithm) from the results, we can see that the word \u201ceat\u201d is used similarly to \u201cambition\u201d, \u201cfear\u201d, and \u201capathy\u201d each of the twenty-two times that it occurs in Paradise Lost. \u00a0</p> <p>This, taken in contrast with the same interaction in the Book of Genesis, creates a very cool result. There, we get the following return from the function:</p> <p>Be drink abram bear beast day die haran him Isaac Jacob \u00a0shur simeon thee you abidah abimael accad accept</p> <p>So, removing the proper nouns and concentrating on the most interesting words, we get \u201cdrink\u201d, \u201cdie\u201d, and \u201caccept\u201d for results. That these are all identical parts of speech probably has more to do with the fact that this algorithm was designed using the King James Bible as a reference text than anything else, but the nature of the words when contrasted with Paradise Lost is very interesting:</p>   Now, this can be seen in a way as the beginning of a clear disjunction between John Milton and the author of the Bible. Perhaps this disjunction can be simply explained by Milton\u2019s having had time to reflect on the stories and is explicitly attempting to imbue the characters of Adam and Eve with literary qualities, which may have not been the ambition of the Bible Author.    We can begin to trace these disjunctions of opinion further by looking for other significant departures between these two authors. This time around, we will go straight to the heart of the matter and examine the word \u201csin.\u201d    The number one word that comes up for similarity to \u201csin\u201d in Paradise lost is \u201cstrength,\u201d second to \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201cman\u201d? This jumps off the page\u2014and will be examined shortly\u2014but it makes sense to spend some time on the rest of these results. First, there is probably something to be said about the more consistent position that Milton seems to be taking with these characterizations\u2014that Sin is something that is characteristic of Man and that it\u2019s also something bad\u2014in contrast to the much less \u201ccolored in\u201d position that the Book of Genesis seems to be taking. When we get results like this from NLTK\u2014where results are not thematic and even necessarily sensical (cattle?)\u2014there is actually thematic information in this result.  When we summarize the meaning of a word in our language, we commonly do it through the use of synonyms and antonyms. This is true of simple word constructions (\u201ceat\u201d is like \u201cgorge\u201d with a difference of degree) but we also do it commonly with more complex ideas. It is commonplace for entrepreneurs to describe their ideas as (existing company) for (new market). Such comparators are often lampooned, but there is genuine information value in saying something like \u201cIt\u2019s just like Facebook for pandas\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a distributed social network for presentation tools.\u201d  The thematic information that we retrieve from the lack of a consistent identity for Sin within the corpus of the Book of Genesis is that there is not an articulated position about it. Interestingly, every time that Anger\u2014its closest synonym\u2014shows up in the Book of Genesis it makes reference to the anger of others, so to the Bible author anger was a possession of other people that is synonymous with sin.  Perhaps because of Milton\u2019s approach\u2014creating a narrative out of a preexisting story\u2014there is a more \u201cmeaty\u201d association with sin than just the related concept of anger in Paradise Lost proper\u2026and the concept that he has chosen\u2014or at least that the software has interpreted him as having chosen\u2014is the concept of \u201cstrength.\u201d  This may very well be a case for questioning the validity of NLTK\u2014it\u2019s an incredible (meaning: not immediately credible) result\u2014but it bears further examination.  Part of the reason for this must be that strength and sin are both used close to half of the time near the end of a clause in writing. About seventy percent of the time that the word \u201cstrength\u201d appears in Paradise Lost, it\u2019s next to a piece of punctuation. The same is close to true for Sin, which appears next to punctuation about half of the time.  There\u2019s a more literary explanation though. If we consider the nature of what it means to disobey the word of an all-powerful creator, it\u2019s not insane to assume that there must be some feature of strength in the action. One of the very interesting passages in paradise lost (with text line markers unfortunately lost in its tokenized state) is the phrase \u201cWith strength from truth divided,\u201d which does actually give some support to the notion that maybe there\u2019s a concordance between sin and strength in this text.

In addition to the loans that Chinese banks have made and the curious ghost cities that have been popping up in China, we discussed the philosophy of the Chinese government and the relationship that their notable portfolio of treasuries has with the United States' future.\u00a0</p> <p>Check out the podcast below, and read on for a few clips from Gordon's excellent Forbes column.\u00a0</p> <p>Click here to listen to the audio.</p> <p>On the recent spike in overnight rates:</p> <p>\"The overnight repo rate in China has just hit 25%, an indication the credit market is now frozen. This month, liquidity tightened considerably. Two government bill auctions failed, and several banks defaulted on their interbank obligations. Overnight rates in the last few weeks surged to about 15% but had fallen back, settling in at just north of 7%. The 25% rate indicates credit is becoming unavailable. Nothing is going right for China at the moment. In the last few hours, the HSBC Flash PMI for June came in at 48.3, down considerably from the 49.2 final reading for May. The country\u2019s problems are now starting to feed on themselves.\"</p> <p>And on the threats to the Chinese economy:</p> <p>\"And there is a broader issue. For more than four decades, Washington has sought to \u201cengage\u201d Beijing and bring it into the international community. Inside the existing geopolitical order China prospered, and in the past quarter century the people who have benefited the most from the American-led system are not the Americans but the Chinese. In a peaceful world the Chinese manufactured and traded their way up through the ranks of nations and, as a consequence, transformed their country for the better. Yet their leaders no longer accept the world as it is. Once deft, subtle, and patient, Chinese diplomacy has, especially since the end of 2009, become shrill and hostile. And Beijing has increasingly set itself against America \u2014 as well as its generals and admirals. We are now hearing war talk in the Chinese capital from civilians, such as new leader Xi Jinping, and flag officers alike. Unfortunately for Chinese policymakers, the resulting controversies are occurring in conjunction with others, both internal and external.

After a multi-hour meeting where many of us talked about all sorts of things, I managed to wrangle Tom into a quick interview.</p> <p>Before posting the interview, I\u2019ll say that if you don\u2019t already follow Tom\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0or on his excellent blog,\u00a0The Research Puzzle, then you are probably missing out. He is a regular font of provocative thoughts, and that can be one of the most useful things in the world. He has also written a number of excellent posts for Inside Investing, including\u00a0a thoughtful look at how you should consider cash\u00a0and a post about\u00a0the most important question to ask about a projected rate of return.</p> <p>If these topics are of interest to you, you should sign up for my newsletter. </p> <p>CFA Institute:\u00a0Tom, one of the things that we\u2019ve been talking with colleagues here about is all of the barriers that exist and keep people from getting to the truth. How do you tell if research is good in this climate? How do you piece through that?</p> <p>Tom Brakke, CFA:\u00a0That\u2019s a very difficult question in terms of trying to ascertain whether research is good. I think the first place I would start is that research is not necessarily good in terms of if it\u2019s formulaic. I would start there. Let\u2019s just put it in the broader brush of due diligence, for example, which is what somebody, a research analyst for example, would be doing in terms of preparing a research report is in essence doing due diligence of one kind or another, and they\u2019re trying to come to a conclusion.</p> <p>If you\u2019re doing due diligence, you can run through a checklist and feel like you\u2019ve done due diligence. But that\u2019s a check list. It\u2019s a pre defined way of thinking about the world. When you think about a research report or the responsibilities of an analyst to do certain kinds of research, lots of times it takes that same \u201ccheck the box\u201d approach.</p> <p>I think good research, good due diligence in general, means looking for differential information and approaching the problem in different ways. When I think about good research, I want to see that somebody\u2019s giving me insight into the situation that I couldn\u2019t have otherwise gotten.</p> <p>Let\u2019s just take written research, which we see most commonly from sell side firms, for example. It\u2019s remarkably similar in almost all respects from firm to firm. You will see some differences. I would say focus on the differences. Focus on the different theses that somebody might use, a different approach they might take, the identification of the specific things that are unique to their study.</p> <p>When you pull out everything say in a research report or in a communication from an analyst verbally or from a portfolio manager or anybody that\u2019s doing things, if you take out all of the stuff that\u2019s the same and just focus on what\u2019s different, it\u2019s a remarkably small amount of information. That\u2019s where you ought to start is with the differential information.</p> <p>A lot of times, it\u2019s very difficult to find that, to comb through, to piece it. Because that\u2019s not what, say a research report again. I don\u2019t want to focus just on reports in general. But that\u2019s not what they lead with, necessarily. You have to dig for it. You have to know what\u2019s different.</p> <p>The person communicating their research ideas, that\u2019s the lead. To get all of the extraneous material away and to get that differential information requires doing things different than other people, just by definition. I think that\u2019s the major failing of doing research or a due diligence process in general is basically following well worn steps is not a path to enlightenment, if you will.</p> <p>In talking about the differential information, you\u2019ve hit on something else, which is the mechanics of information transmission. You\u2019re notable in that you have several different pieces of media through which you transmit your thoughts.</p> <p>Does the substance change at all? How do you think about the way that you communicate yourself in social media in the context of\u2026Do you change the substance to fit the medium at all? Or does the medium devalue the substance in any way?</p> <p>Does the medium devalue the substance? In the eyes of some viewers, perhaps it does. Perhaps they don\u2019t think that if it\u2019s available online it can be value added. Obviously as somebody who produces information online, I disagree with that.</p> <p>But I know that that\u2019s a fairly common perception. In terms of what\u2019s the right forum for a particular idea, I\u2019ve probably gone too far in the sense that I have three different blogs that kind of do things. The original one, \u201cThe Research Puzzle\u201d is about mostly investment process, how the industry works. Second one, which is called \u201cPix,\u201d features charts, so there\u2019s a visual aspect to it.</p> <p>A pet project of mine is to convey investment information more creatively in a visual fashion than the industry typically does, which is the goal of that one. Then I\u2019ve got a third one that\u2019s called \u201cPieces\u201d that\u2019s kind of a scrapbook of different kinds of ideas. I also do a newsletter for institutional investors that pass on information to them from others.</p> <p>It\u2019s a digest format that I think is of interest. Each of those has a specific purpose so that the readers of those know what they\u2019re getting and selecting. Like I said, I probably went too far in putting things in too many different places so that it might be harder for the reader trying to find the body of my work to identify with it. To locate it, I should say.</p> <p>I think that when I first started on Twitter, for example, a few years ago, somebody recommended following me, \u201cBecause I had great, original material, and excellent links,\u201d was what he said.</p> <p>I go, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been trying to do.\u201d It\u2019s the originality. It\u2019s the differentiation, as we just talked about, that I focus on most in trying to convey information. That if people read me, I want it to always be presented in a quality fashion of the communication as good as it can possibly be because I think that matters. I think that\u2019s important.</p> <p>Secondly, that the thoughts that I convey are different than they find at other places. That\u2019s certainly the feedback that I get. Whether it\u2019s something that I write myself, the original material, or whether it\u2019s something I find and pass on, whether it\u2019s via Twitter or via newsletter or in one of my blogs. That I\u2019m really trying to put into the discussion and the communication, that I\u2019m providing interesting things that aren\u2019t found elsewhere. If I can be successful at that, I can add value and it doesn\u2019t really matter whether it\u2019s online and available for free or whether I\u2019m providing things directly to clients of mine that don\u2019t otherwise appear. It doesn\u2019t really matter.</p> <p>My purpose is to bring that information forth, to bring that context, and to be creative about it and say, \u201cHere\u2019s something different that people haven\u2019t really been focusing on.\u201d If I can do that in a quality fashion, then I\u2019m going to find readers that gain benefit from it, then I can hopefully gain consulting clients, too.</p> <p>It sounds like to you the information has value regardless of the transmission mechanism.</p> <p>Well, you can\u2019t just send out information and say it has value. There\u2019s a curation aspect to it. That hopefully if I\u2019m disseminating something, no matter the forum, that people expect that I have\u2026it\u2019s not that I approve of everything I send out, because sometimes I send out things that I think, for example, are well written and interesting that I don\u2019t agree with. I think that\u2019s part of it, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just I\u2019m sending things out by people that agree with me on something or other. The important thing is sending out good material and getting people to think about important issues, whether I happen to agree with them or not.</p> <p>Now, if I\u2019m writing an original piece, they\u2019re going to know where I\u2019m coming from. But hopefully, you get the range of ideas that you\u2019re providing to people. That if you do that, they\u2019re going to respect and understand that and respond to the information that you give them.</p> <p>**In closing, we\u2019ve been here at CFA Institute offices for a couple of hours now talking about a wide range of events. **</p> <p>Yeah, all different sorts of things.</p> <p>One of the things that comes out is there are a wide variety of different sorts of investment management firms. A piece that you wrote on your blog,\u00a0the letters to a young analyst, you talk about the notion of a special place where an analyst can build a career. Similarly, those would ostensibly be places where a client can build some wealth.</p> <p>Exactly. I think they go together, by the way. That the kind of place that can truly be a home for a young analyst or portfolio manager or any other role within an investment organization goes with the kind of place that a client can hopefully build up wealth. I think there\u2019s a connection there.</p> <p>What are some of the qualities, besides client alignment? Do they have certain typefaces on their website?</p> <p>[laughs] No. I think it\u2019s a perspective on the long term goals of what this business ought to be about. That you are delivering value over time, and that you create value by building an organization, by building a team, by thinking thoroughly about process. If you\u2019ve read me, I write lots and lots about investment process and investment decision making.</p> <p>I\u2019m kind of an evangelist for process, if you will. That doing that well is very hard work, and it takes a long time. There\u2019s a cumulative effect of that. If you\u2019re starting off a new firm, you\u2019re not going to have that instantaneously. But if you do it in the right way, you\u2019ll have it probably sooner than you think. People will recognize that both, prospective employers and prospective clients.</p> <p>For an established firm, it\u2019s a little bit different. Because the culture is the culture and it\u2019s hard to change. It\u2019s a lot easier to destroy a culture than it is to create one. I\u2019ve seen it happen. I think it\u2019s very much about the culture of understanding that it is a cooperative venture in the sense that you\u2019re there for a particular purpose.</p> <p>The purpose is the client. What you\u2019re trying to help the client do. That is to build wealth over time. We get into this culture of, it\u2019s all other people\u2019s money and we\u2019re just slinging it around and we\u2019re extracting our free and our mission is to grow assets and grow fees and that\u2019s always defined ourselves.</p> <p>As we discussed earlier, that\u2019s why there\u2019s a gulf between what clients expect and what a lot of investment organizations are delivering. As an industry and as a profession, we need to close that gulf. It is really about managing that money as if it was our own, to make the right kinds of decisions, to be willing and able to buck the pressures of the industry, which is perhaps the hardest thing.</p> <p>We talked about a number of these things earlier, about the misaligned incentives a lot of times, the pressures in the industry, the relative performance derbies and all the things that end up keeping us from meeting the client\u2019s objectives instead of helping us meet the client objectives.</p> <p>If you\u2019re an investment professional and you land in a place where all of that is in the right perspective, not that you won\u2019t have difficult choices and hard issues to deal with and conflicts that you have to deal with. But if you\u2019re in a place where that\u2019s being addressed in the right way as opposed to just, let\u2019s build this business and make a lot of money and fend for ourselves instead of our clients, then that\u2019s probably the core of it.</p> <p>But there is a culture aspect to it that is, it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s hard to get at. A lot of times, you\u2019ll know it when you feel it, if you will. It\u2019s hard to see that prospectively as a young person entering the business, for example. It\u2019s really hard to see that. But if you see it and you feel it and you get to be a part of it, one of the things I tried to reflect on and mention in that last letter to the young analyst is that you might not realize how special that is.</p> <p>Somebody\u2019s going to come and jangle some money in front of you and try to entice you to leave. Sometimes you need to do that. Sometimes it\u2019s the right thing to do that. But if you don\u2019t really appreciate for the uniqueness of the situation that you might be in, you might not think as well about that decision as you could.</p> <p>That was really the point I was trying to make there. That if you find a home in this business that\u2019s a right kind of home, that\u2019s really worth a lot and you ought to value that opportunity appropriately.</p> <p>Got you.

An attractive premise!</p> <p>Lars Kroijer:\u00a0Well, thanks for having me!</p> <p>**Very, very pleased to do that. In\u00a0your first book, you outline the steps that you went through in setting up your own hedge fund where step one was hire a team, step two was get service providers\u2026and sometime after step three you wind up rich, popular, and happy. Is that still how it works? **</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure any of those three is still true, but I guess to some degree. The reason I wrote the first book was that I thought the hedge fund industry has been one where lots of things have been written and spoken, a lot of which were bad myths and misunderstandings.</p> <p>It was generally described in very sensationalist terms where everyone became a multi\u2011billionaire or was a crook, whereas the industry that I had seen from the inside was really quite different from that.</p> <p>I thought I was in a unique position to tell the story, from someone who, frankly, went into my first hedge fund interview without really knowing what a hedge fund was to joining the industry, working in it for years, and eventually launching my own fund.</p> <p>The book was really more about that, trying to explain what the hedge fund industry is like from the perspective of someone who\u2019s, lived a lot of facets of it. It wasn\u2019t trying to be sensationalist. One of the reasons it ended up doing well was because a lot of people could relate to it.</p> <p>Interestingly, the best feedback I probably got was from people in the industry. Just saying they recognized a lot of the stuff, even the stupid little stories of humiliations and losing money and being overlooked and all the stuff that we all live and that people could recognize. That was actually, perhaps, the most heartwarming part of the feedback.</p> <p>Your question, does the same thing still hold? Well, it could, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t, every hedge fund start up story is perhaps different. But what do you need? I tell people that approach me about selling hedge funds, you need three things.</p> <p>You need a good product, you need a good investment product and you need to make sure that you\u2019re pretty convinced that that\u2019s the case and you love being the provider of that product, i.e., that this is not a get rich quick scheme, which some people seem to think it is.</p> <p>You need some money to invest, that seems pretty obvious and often forgotten by people who want to start hedge funds, because they think that comes naturally. But it\u2019s pretty hard to raise money for a hedge fund. Always was, mind you, but that\u2019s certainly true today.</p> <p>The one reason for that is because the media will tend to talk about the success stories, someone running billions and billions and flying helicopters and living in big houses, whereas the mundane reality is very different for a lot of people in the industry.</p> <p>Then the third thing you need is you need to be able to sustain the business. What does that mean? That means pay the bills and keep the lights on and get the right kind of computer equipment and the right team around you. Incur the costs of complying with the regulation and keeping your service providers happy.</p> <p>That\u2019s no small point, actually. Because if you don\u2019t manage a lot of money early on, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of fee income coming in. It\u2019s pretty obvious stuff. But that still holds true today.</p> <p>**I\u2019ve heard people say, there\u2019s nobody who wakes up in the morning and says, \u201cGee, I really wish I had more hedge funds.\u201d **</p> <p>Well, there was a time when that was the case. I think there were a lot of pension funds who woke up and said, \u201cOh, I must buy some hedge funds.\u201d</p> <p>It seems that there are fewer of those eureka moments in the pension fund industry today.</p> <p>**Why has that enthusiasm tapered off? How are hedge funds working, really, for the clients? Is part of that lack of enthusiasm driven by a lack of returns? **</p> <p>Well, first of all, I think, can\u2019t neglect the fact that the industry has grown just a staggering amount over the last decade and a half. There probably was an unmet demand that to some extent has been met.</p> <p>Then the second thing is that the industry\u2019s now, I think, managing $2 trillion. That\u2019s a lot of money. That almost is the market, right? If you slap a large amount of fees and expenses on that amount of capital, well, it\u2019s got to be pretty hard to outperform as an aggregate.</p> <p>I\u2019m a huge skeptic of aggregate data in the industry because I think a lot of it has lots of biases and vested interests. I struggle to see that the high fee levels can be justified, particularly because so many funds are so correlated to markets.</p> <p>You\u2019ve got to keep in mind you can get market exposure for 15 basis points a year. If you\u2019re charging 200 basis point management fees a and 2,000 basis point incentive fee, you\u2019ve got to be providing something other than that. I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t exist because in many cases it does.</p> <p>On the other hand, if you can provide an investment product that doesn\u2019t correlate to the markets, that\u2019s incredibly valuable. Think of it: if you\u2019re an insurance company you\u2019ve got fixed liabilities, because people\u2019s car crashes don\u2019t depend on the market. If you\u2019re a pension fund and people\u2019s future retirement depends on the market you can be pretty unlucky if you don\u2019t have enough, as you\u2019ve witnessed in a lot of places in the US and elsewhere.</p> <p>The premise of the product is brilliant. Uncorrelated returns are the Holy Grail of investing. If you can create that you ought to be a rock star, and a very well paid one. I just think the reality is perhaps sometimes a little bit more mundane.</p> <p>For all the sex appeal, it\u2019s just a bunch of guys in offices.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, a lot of very, very smart guys, very well informed guys that sometimes provide a brilliant product for a very high price. That doesn\u2019t mean they all do, but some people undoubtedly do.</p> <p>**To your point on aggregate data, one of our authors on Inside Investing, Ted Seides, has made that point pretty well. (Check out \u201cRethinking Hedge Fund Indices\u201c) **</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of garbage. There is in a lot of places, though. Also keep in mind that it\u2019s hard to buy the industry. There are hedge fund index trackers. I don\u2019t know how well they all work.</p> <p>But a big part of even what Ted does is to pick hedge fund managers. It\u2019s a little bit like stock pickers except you\u2019re a hedge fund picker. If you\u2019re good at that, that\u2019s a very valuable thing to be good at. It includes the analysis of data, but also a lot of softer things like management, and credibility, and the strategy that they undertake, and the future of that strategy, et cetera, et cetera.</p> <p>Again, I wrote the first book for an even simpler reason than taking a view on the industry and whether it\u2019s good or bad. I thought there was a story to tell.</p> <p>Absolutely. It a great story. Some of the reaction to it that I saw was focused on the difference between what the audience expected and what they found. Can you talk about that a little bit? </p> <p>First of all, it\u2019s a little bit like if you had to write a story about football and the only thing you wrote about were the top teams, and assumed that anyone who played football, anyone in the world, would like to know who played for Arsenal or Chelsea. We ended up doing very well, but that\u2019s not actually what\u2019s interesting about the story.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, whenever I give talks what I can see resonates most with people are our early failings.</p> <p>The misery of trying to start a hedge fund with very little money is much more interesting to people than whether you made a billion, or a million, or a $100,000 because that\u2019s the story they\u2019ve read in \u201cForbes Magazine\u201d ten times. Also, what does it actually take? Who do you go to? Who do you call?</p> <p>I think something a lot people resonate with is, this presumption that if I were to start a hedge fund\u2026the generic \u201cI.\u201d If one were to start a hedge fund I could call my 10 best friends and they\u2019d turn up with some money.</p> <p>I was certainly guilty of that myself. Very quickly i saw the error of my ways\u2026Very little money actually turns up when the rubber hits the road.</p> <p>If you shift to the average investor, hedge funds, obviously \u2014 very complicated industry, lots of things going on there. But is this the thing that the average investor can even try to grok?</p> <p>First of all, the average investor probably has hedge fund exposure, through their pension fund or even indirectly through their insurance company or their bank. So you have an exposure, but it\u2019s very hard for you to understand what that exposure exactly is. And that\u2019s probably an issue.</p> <p>But taking a step back, frankly, for the retail investor, a lot of times they simply wouldn\u2019t be allowed to invest in a hedge fund, just size constraints, qualified investor constraints, i.e. so many specific rules here in the UK regarding being approached, even, by hedge funds for the purpose of investing.</p> <p>If you\u2019re not an expert in hedge funds, I would strongly encourage you to look elsewhere to put your money, only because here\u2019s a product and you know it might be interesting, but one thing you know for sure is that it\u2019s expensive. And so you\u2019re looking at a very expensive product where you\u2019re not an expert. But you think, \u201cWell, maybe I should let other people try to pick the best ones.\u201d</p> <p>**I\u2019m going to ask a stupid question. Are fees actually important? **</p> <p>Yeah.</p> <p>No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stupid question at all, actually. It\u2019s a very good one because frankly, if you look at\u2026I\u2019m struggling to think of any other industry where high fees are not somehow correlated with better service or a better product, most places that\u2019s the case.</p> <p>Otherwise the higher\u2011fee end of the spectrum would self\u2011destruct. Frankly, other than perhaps government spending, where else can you be horribly inefficient with other people\u2019s money and it not coming back to bite you?</p> <p>Economic theory would suggest that if there is an expensive product that seems to thrive, so it must be valuable. Which, not to lead you into the second book, but that\u2019s why I wrote the second book, because it actually starts with a very, very different premise, which is one of saying, \u201cWell, who are you to ask?\u201d Which is really saying, \u201cAre you able to distinguish?\u201d</p> <p>So you know on the one hand, you\u2019re paying a lot for something. On the other hand, there are very, very cheap alternatives, and you can\u2019t convince me the very expensive ones in the aggregate make sense, if you\u2019re blindly throwing darts. So you shouldn\u2019t try at all.</p> <p>You should index. This is the premise of the second book, is this whole idea of, do you have an ability or edge to beat the market? And I argue and I certainly think that the vast majority of people don\u2019t. Well, in the aggregate, you can\u2019t because in the aggregate, that is the market.</p> <p>You are the market. But why don\u2019t most people have that capacity?</p> <p>First of all, if you think of someone who buys or sells stocks in the market, what is the market? It\u2019s an aggregation of a ton of sometimes extraordinarily well\u2011informed investors with access to better information than you, better analysis, better access to management, to industry experts, to execution, to understanding data flow, statistical analysis, etc., etc. It\u2019s just extremely hard for my mom to compete.</p> <p>So the price\u2026at the end of that whole sausage factory called the market of analysis and insight is a price that reflects the aggregate opinion of the market participants. No disrespect to my mom, but for my mom to essentially go in and say, \u201cI know better,\u201d that\u2019s a pretty tall order. There\u2019s every likelihood that she cannot.</p> <p>Then add to that that she\u2019s probably at a huge cost disadvantage. She is charged more to trade. She will probably trade frequently, which is a terrible idea. If she buys, she will buy on the offer and sell on the bid, even something as small as that, which for the the less liquid stocks actually matters.</p> <p>There\u2019s also every academic study backing the fact that even trying makes no sense for her, unless she is a rare, rare case of someone who is able to consistently beat the market.</p> <p>When I say beat the market, there\u2019s another thing there. I could go out and buy\u2026pick a random stock. Say, Vodafone or since there are mainly American listeners, Microsoft. Let\u2019s say I go and buy Microsoft and it skyrockets tomorrow. That doesn\u2019t mean I had edge. It might mean I was lucky.</p> <p>So eliminate that. Incidentally, Microsoft could decline massively in value tomorrow. That also doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have edge. You can\u2019t turn around and say that either.</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy to prove or disprove edge. I hate to say it, this sounds awful, but you have to look inside yourself and say, \u201cWell, what are the chances that I have it?\u201d And when you\u2019re at an analytical disadvantage, information disadvantage, and a huge cost disadvantage, the chances are very, very small.</p> <p>So what I\u2019m trying to do in this book is to say, \u201cWell, on the basis of the premise that you probably don\u2019t have edge, what should you do?\u201d</p> <p>**This book, the subtitle, again, is \u201cHow to Invest Without Speculation.\u201d We did another \u201cInside Investing\u201d thing where we asked a bunch of guests, what are the differences between those two things? I wonder, your thoughts on that. (Editor\u2019s note, Read responses from\u00a0Howard Marks,\u00a0Martin Fridson,\u00a0Robert Hagstrom,\u00a0Brad McMillan, and\u00a0Malcolm Trevillian) ** \u201cInvest without speculation.\u201d First of all, the subtitle partly came about because of the publisher\u2026.So you\u2019re putting me a little bit on the spot here, and the sleepless nights bit also, but the whole point is, what do you do with your money in the long term when you don\u2019t claim to be someone who can beat the market and speculate and outperform and gamble? I\u2019m not saying those all associate, but what if you just want your money to grow slowly, boringly, in a way that makes sense for your risk level over the long term?</p> <p>That\u2019s what I associate with sensible, what I call rational investing. Because it\u2019s rational if you accept that you can\u2019t beat the market, and there\u2019s very little speculative about that. In fact, you\u2019re trying to take speculation out of it. You\u2019re trying to say, \u201cI know I don\u2019t know a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Now, keep in mind, what I\u2019m saying, lack of edge doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re stupid. In fact most professors would be adhering to this strategy. So there\u2019s this kind of investing. Some of the smartest minds will do this. They will simply say, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can beat the market. Or I don\u2019t have the time, I have a day job,\u201d or, \u201cI hate being wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Or even, \u201cI want to go walk on the beach sometimes. I just don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, look at myself. I stopped running money in hedge\u2011fund world. I invest only in index funds. I don\u2019t think you can\u2026When I was doing it, I found a really great edge. But I also believe that it is bloody hard.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think you can do it half. The whole that you can come home from work at 5:00, look at some talk show about stocks, then pick which one \u2014 where they\u2019re right and where they\u2019re wrong, and then go buy some stocks the next morning before you go to work. I just think it\u2019s wrong. I just think there\u2019s every chance you\u2019re going to do a little bit worse.</p> <p>So don\u2019t. It\u2019s hard\u2011earned money. It\u2019s pretty boring, all right? Over time there\u2019s every reason to think that you will do better and by cumulative, quite staggering amount. I think you should index, on the basic premise that you don\u2019t have edge.</p> <p>The trick then is index funds.</p> <p>Yeah. If we can for a second, because it\u2019s easier to understand, just think about stock markets. Obviously, you should not only think about stock markets. Say the S&amp;P is an index to think about. So why do I think, if the world was only S&amp;P that you should play the index?</p> <p>It\u2019s because you don\u2019t think you can beat the markets, you don\u2019t think you can reallocate capital within that index in such a way that you generate a superior return profile. The byproduct of that is that the investment product you\u2019re trying to get is extremely simple.</p> <p>A monkey couldn\u2019t put it together, but a computer can very, very cheaply which is why they cost ten bps a year, or 0.1 percent, and trade very little, so there are those added advantages.</p> <p>You are essentially buying securities in the proportion that the market has determined for you, so you are coming along in the market, if you will.</p> <p>Why does that make sense? Well, because you don\u2019t think you can do better. Why does that make sense? Well, because you don\u2019t have edge.</p> <p>That\u2019s what you should do in the S&amp;P 500. Now suppose you added an alternative, which is the Euro Stoxx 50 \u2014 that\u2019s the main European stock index \u2014 and you had those two, S&amp;P and Euro Stoxx 50. How should you allocate between those two?</p> <p>Again, the market is allocating in terms of capital weighting, so you allocate them in proportion to their values. Why is that? That\u2019s because you don\u2019t know better than the market and that\u2019s what the market has done. Now if there was added advantage from selling S&amp;P 500 down 10 percent and buying the Euro Stoxx 10 percent, then the market would presumably do that.</p> <p>Extend that logic to all equity markets and all currencies around the world. I argue that you can create an extraordinarily diversified product by simply buying the world equity index. You can do that through one index tracker, so you\u2019re talking one security for all your equity holdings, and you get an extremely cheap, because it is that simple.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very simple index to buy, because you\u2019re buying one stock and that represents sometimes thousands of underlying securities, across a range of capitalized sizes, and geographies and industries. You\u2019re widely diversifying and you are getting the world equity exposure. Do that and it is very simple.</p> <p>It happens to be theoretically \u2014 like academic theory \u2014 not far from what they were all ranting on about 30 years ago, before anyone could actually, properly do it.</p> <p>Back then it was very easy. You had these great academic theorists and brilliant minds talk about the risk\u2011free rate, which sounds like an oxymoron.</p> <p>Then you can buy and you\u2019ve seen the capital market line and the correlations, and all that stuff, you smile faintly at them. Back then it really meant the US, because that was the only real market. Then eventually\u2026Even when I went to college \u2011\u2011 I\u2019m 41 years old, I\u2019m not that old \u2011\u2011 we\u2019re really talking the maybe Europe and Japan. That was pretty much it.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s 50 countries, right? Why is India any worse than the US? There\u2019s no reason you would expect them to do any better or any worse, relative to its risk levels. But you can add that incredible diversification. That product was just very, very hard to buy 20 years ago.</p> <p>Now you can. Those products exist. In 10 years there are going to be even more of them. It\u2019s going to be even cheaper, I expect.</p> <p>**Isn\u2019t it the kind of thing that as you get, let\u2019s say my investment portfolio has $1, $10, $100 million\u2026 **</p> <p>Good for you. [laughs]</p> <p>This is strictly a hypothetical. This is a non\u2011profit organization, but presumably at each of those different levels \u2011\u2011 $1, $10, $100 million \u2011\u2011 one percentage point of added performance is increasingly valuable in cash terms. You beat the market by one percent on a $1,000, it might not be that relevant, but on $100 million, it could probably buy something pretty nice. Is it the case that as your level of wealth rises, you should do something else? Or is that something that something that really works for everyone?</p> <p>No, I think that\u2019s an interesting observation. It think actually that pertains much more to your risk profile. Think of it this way. Let\u2019s say you have $100 in your account and you needed $95 next year for heart surgery. You shouldn\u2019t buy equities. That seems pretty obvious to everyone.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s say you have $100 in your account and you know you have some yet\u2011to\u2011be\u2011determined need in retirement 40 years from now. You should probably buy some equities, because there\u2019s every reason to think that over the long term they out\u2011perform inflation. There will be huge dips, but you can afford to incur those dips.</p> <p>The question of, \u201cWhat will an extra one percent do for you?\u201d is really, other than the simple math of it, it\u2019s a very individual question of risk, and one I touch on a lot. How should you think about this? How should you think about draw downs and the inevitable \u201cOh, my God, I didn\u2019t think it could be this bad\u201d?</p> <p>What a one percent draw\u2011down means for you is quite individual. When I say individual, I doesn\u2019t mean to the individual person, but the individual as an institution. One way to think about risk is by\u2011an\u2011large, correctly, a lot of people have discredited standard risk matrices, like standard deviations.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take as an example and say you have $100, and you want $150 in 30 years, but you absolutely need $120. You can say, \u201cIf I put it all in equities\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s say you have an expected risk premium of four, five percent above inflation, which is what it\u2019s been historically. You can say, \u201c\u2026in 30 years that\u2019s going to accumulate to X.\u201d</p> <p>What is the risk you\u2019re willing to accept that you don\u2019t get to $120? Does that mean that you die \u2011\u2011 you and everyone you\u2019ve ever loved? Does that mean that you can\u2019t be a member of a golf club, which you could live with?</p> <p>What does that mean as an individual thing? That should partly drive your allocations and acceptance of risk. I try to touch on that in the book. If you come up with a hypothetical example of someone who puts aside some money every year between ages \u2011\u2011 I\u2019m not going to guess your age \u2011\u2011 call it 30 to 70, or 65, and say therefore you should have X.</p> <p>If you believe these numbers, the standard risk, standard return expectations as an expected outcome. Now let\u2019s say you have a minimum you absolutely need. What is the probability you\u2019re willing to accept that you don\u2019t get it? Is it five? Is it 10, is it 20 percent?</p> <p>What you can do is let\u2019s say you have a choice between the world equity markets and something very, very safe. Assume for a second it\u2019s government bonds. Let\u2019s say that you then allocate more toward government bonds. Well, we\u2019d all appreciate that your expected outcome many years hence will be lower, but the certainty of that outcome will be higher. There\u2019s less risk.</p> <p>You can therefore go along that continuum and say, if you say, \u201cI accept no risk,\u201d buy a 30\u2011year government bond. You know you\u2019re going to have X, but you\u2019re also going to have very little potential upside. That\u2019s one way you can start thinking about risk. But it\u2019s an interesting topic.</p> <p>I also talk a lot about insurance as something that people should avoid if they can afford not to, and money in the bank, which I argue is not without its risks. Pensions, which I argue the vast majority of people get royally taken to the cleaners by various managers, certainly in aggregate, over many, many years.</p> <p>It\u2019s written to my mom, although she\u2019s perhaps a little old to do the 40\u2011year time horizon, unfortunately.</p> <p>**Perhaps it is a little late for her. ** She\u2019ll probably actually live another 40 years.</p> <p>**The book is \u201cInvesting Demystified,\u201d which you can buy on\u00a0Amazon. **</p> <p>It\u2019s just out, in fact, earlier this week.</p> <p>**Just out this week. It has got some very inspiring upward\u2011facing arrows on the front of it. **</p> <p>Yeah, there you go, and I didn\u2019t have anything to do with those\u2026.</p> <p>I encourage everyone to pick it up.

Obviously, India is important to the investment profession and to individual investors around the world, but so are many places. Why did we start here?</p> <p>We began to see a number of reports focusing on India as a place that was either doomed to political infighting and runaway inflation or as the \u201cwhite knight\u201d of an investor\u2019s portfolio: one of the few places in a growth-constrained world that was likely to see expansion over time.</p> <p>It seems, perhaps, like all of these things may be true. And they don\u2019t necessarily contradict each other. The interview below with\u00a0Sunil Singhania, CFA, and all of the interviews and posts that we will publish over the next couple of days, represent our attempts to get leading investment thinkers to explain to us exactly how that could be.</p> <p>CFA Institute: It\u2019s Sloane Ortel here with Inside Investing at the CFA Institute, and I\u2019m in the New York office of CFA Institute, but I am on the phone with Sunil Singhania, who is the CIO of Equities at Reliance Mutual Funds. He\u2019s also (in a sense) my boss\u2019s, boss\u2019s boss at CFA Institute. He\u2019s on our board of governors, the first Indian ever to reach that lofty perch. Sir, I\u2019m on my best behavior.</p> <p>Sunil Singhania, CFA: Thanks a lot.</p> <p>I want to ask you, we were just speaking, and I rattled off a bunch of questions and said, \u201cIs it OK to talk to these\u201d? and you said, \u201cThat\u2019s what people usually ask.\u201d What don\u2019t people usually ask that they perhaps should be asking?</p> <p>I don\u2019t know whether they should be asking or not, but domestic investors generally, and I\u2019m talking about the equity investors. They\u2019ve had a phenomenal sort of period between 2003, and 2008, investing in equities, where they made upwards of 30/35 percent compounded returns year after year. The account now is growing, there was huge money flow, and everything was going on well.</p> <p>What has happened in the last five years, Indian equity markets have generally been flat, and the domestic investors particularly ask, \u201cWhat is long-term\u201d? Investors who have come in, in the last four or five years, have not been any return.</p> <p>That is what normally the investors ask, and from our perspective, the only perspectives we can share with them is that, \u201cYes, the last three, four, five years have been tough. There have been some things which have happened for the first time in the world in the last hundred, 200 years, and it\u2019s more sort of a one off thing.</p> <p>You have to look at growing economy from a longer term perspective, and that is what we try to explain. From the global investors perspective, India has always been a favorite investment destination. However, they can get confused with, you can say, a little bit more democracy than what we need. So government policies and politics is what normally the foreign investors will ask about.</p> <p>Though again, just to give you our perspective we have seen in all the last 20 years, all government has been coalition government, and it has worked out pretty well, so the concerns are definitely there in the near term, but from our perspective they should also be looking at a slightly longer period, and they\u2019ll get their own answers.</p> <p>Yeah, in thinking about this long-term, one of the things I have to ask is, as an offshore investor who has invested in Indian equities in the past, I occasionally form part of a cohort that can be quite troubling for domestic Indian investors, where I combine with many other people in New York, and London, and elsewhere, into these flows that can really, really distort things for you over there. How important are international investor flows for you, and just how closely do you watch them?</p> <p>Listen, it\u2019s a great question, but if you actually see the trend of the global flows, it\u2019s almost every year has been positive despite what is happening globally, and despite what has happened in the near past in the Indian economy, in terms of a slowdown. Global investors are looking at India from a longer-term perspective, they\u2019re looking at this 1.2 Billion population, they\u2019re looking at a very young age. We still have a median age of less than 25 years by 2020.</p> <p>There are things that used grows in their consumption phenomena, and as a result of which global flows have always been positive. To answer your question whether global flows are important, there are definitely very important.</p> <p>As an economy, we import a lot of stuff. We are a growing economy, and we lack capital. For all these reasons, we definitely need capital flows into the country, not only to bridge the current account deficit, but also to give that boost which will require to set up capacities, to set up infrastructure, and that is one key reason, or one key need which will enable India to come back to that seven/eight percent growth.</p> <p>Our own perspective is that flows into India have been really strong, even in these last three years of extreme global volatility, and uncertainty, and similar situation in domestic India. We have seen foreign investors pump almost $65 billion into the Indian equity markets. Year to date Indian equity markets, outside of Japan, are the second largest recipient of global flows.</p> <p>We\u2019re not taking US, because we are mostly in a domestic flow, but international flows outside of Japan, India is the second largest. Global flows are important, but at this point of time we feel that there is in fact a narrative saying that the flows should continue to be quite positive.</p> <p>When we talk about investment realities, there are probably the equities in your portfolio, but there are also the Rupees in your wallet. How do you think about your currency right now? It seems like the easy narrative for many years, when thinking about India, was that it was a place for outsourcing, and for structural cost advantages, and it seems like with a declining currency that may again be true, at least at a superficial level.</p> <p>Do you think that that narrative has any resonance, or is it overly simplistic?</p> <p>Currency movements are very complex, and frankly I will admit that I am no expert on currency. Having said that, the last six months/nine months of currency movement definitely has been a little bit worrying, we have seen currency depreciate almost 25 percent before recovering a little bit. There have been multiple reasons for it. Obviously the reasons in hindsight are very easy.</p> <p>We have had a huge trade deficit led largely by oil and gold imports, and we have also seen a scenario where the US economy and the developed economies have been recovering, and as a, you can say, a safe way of investing, investors have in fact been pouring money into India\u2019s economy.</p> <p>Cross-currency movements also led to some impacts which not only that Indian currency has, that we figure a lot of other emerging market currencies like Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, and so on, which have seen a similar kind of volatility.</p> <p>Having said that, again, you can see the period from 2001 to 2010 or \u201911, we saw Rupee in fact appreciate by around 15 percent over a 10 year period. It is not fair to say that the Rupee depreciation is a given year after year. We have seen normal periods where the Rupee has stayed quite stable.</p> <p>All we need is a return to confidence. We have had a new RBI governor but now that we write policies to encourage investors to move away from investing in gold, into yielding assets, which are the financial assets, which has led to some fall in gold imports.</p> <p>Our current account, we have to take it to looking like hitting five percent is now expected to be more like three percent. Yes, given the fact that the global world is a more volatile place, short-term currency movements are definitely the order of the day. But I\u2019m more optimistic of a more stable Rupee, and that might be given a boost if the economy starts to recover.</p> <p>One of the things that, in compiling this special report on India for Inside Investing, one of the things that we heard first from Pradip Shah was that, in his opinion, the Indian Central Bank seems to view its role as protecting the purchasing power of currency now, which is something that, with my dollars in my wallet, I\u2019m not used to hearing about any central bank. But it surely does give cause for optimism, and I guess increased probability of renewed stability.</p> <p>I want to ask you about the at times unequal effect that this sort of volatility can have on a population that has very wide disparities in wealth. In particular, I saw onion prices were up something like 300 percent over the last couple of months.</p> <p>In a population where the bottom 50 percent is living on very little money, that can hit very hard. Do you think that that population, that their ability to consume in an economically productive way, is being materially impacted by this currency volatility, this food inflation?</p> <p>You are right. The food inflation is definitely hitting the bottom rank of the population, because a significant portion of their income goes into spending on food. Having said that, India is a domestic self-reliant economy, we don\u2019t import most of the food we consume. It\u2019s all grown in-house, most of it. To that extent, at least our view won\u2019t be that the movement of Rupee has caused onion prices to go up.</p> <p>Weather patterns globally have become more erratic. We are definitely seeing impact, whether you call it global warming or increased carbonization, which is causing the weather patterns to change. In India, specifically we\u2019re seeing standard of living going up, and as a result of this, demand for better food is going up. Our view on that, in fact, is a more positive sign, rather than negative.</p> <p>Yet, in the near term, supply is taking it\u2019s time to keep up pace with demand. But specifically on the equities inside we have seen not only in India, but globally, that higher prices of produce makes the farmers switch from one crop to another, and it is always a very, very short-term phenomena of significantly higher prices in any one commodity, or one produce. Also, we have had one of the best monsoons over the last 20/30 years this time.</p> <p>The water table is at least 20 to 40 percent higher across India and the world, compared to the 10 year average. We have a very good first indication coming from the Rabi, which is a winter crop plantation, and in the next two or three months, we are definitely hopeful that even the food inflation should start to come off.</p> <p>But very, very clearly, the currency does have an impact on almost everything, but the impact on the food prices would not be as significant, because most of the food we eat is produced in-house.</p> <p>I guess you\u2019re dwelling on that bigger population, but departing from the food trend, I want to ask you about the effectiveness of the financial system for those very poor people. It\u2019s common to talk about people who are under banked, or underserved. What are the impediments that stand in front of a broad-based shareholder class in India?</p> <p>Is there a developing sense that equities are really the place to save your money, or is it still, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy gold, I\u2019m going to buy housing\u201d? Or even, \u201cI don\u2019t have the money to invest. I\u2019m just going to buy food\u201d?</p> <p>Again, the structure of the Indian population, Indian economy, is very different. We are a 1.2 billion population country. At the same time, we do have a lot of poor people, but we also have the world\u2019s largest population of middle class, and we are also among probably the top 5-10 countries in terms of the super rich.</p> <p>There is a wide disparity as far as the whole population is concerned. Having said that, we are a country of large savers. We, on an annualized basis, save between 30 to 35 percent. The savings rate has fallen slightly, but it is still a healthy 30 percent, of which 20 percent is the household savings.</p> <p>With an economy size of $2 trillion, on an average we save $350- to $400 billion as households. Over the last five/seven years, what typically has happened is that a lot of money has gone into hard assets, which is real estate and gold. Largely because those asset classes have been performing very well, and as a result it\u2026in every part of the world, investors normally chase returns.</p> <p>This is where most of the money has gone into. As far as equity is concerned, we had seen a huge surge in a propensity to invest in equity. It is come down over the last four or five years, largely because the immediate past performance of Indian equity markets has not been that great. But this year we have started to see money not get attracted as much by gold, for sure.</p> <p>Real estate also, to some extent, is seeing this jump of the use of it. Still, a lot of money is going in real estate, but we are clearly seeing signs of topping out, and money moving into the financial assets. Now, the beginning of this move usually is on the fixed income side, and we have seen huge improvement in flows to our own fixed income mutual funds from retail investors.</p> <p>Banks certificate deposits are just fine being picked up then, as far as the economy is concerned, have seen record 20 percent less growth in deposit base, and it\u2019s a matter of time before this money selectively starts to move into the equity markets.</p> <p>We are a young nation, you know, we are only 60 years old. If you see the history of other developed nations, In their formative years, equity as a percentage of the total assets were a very small percentage, and then as the economy matured, as the investors matured, as the investor education and literacy increased, the percentage of equity in a person\u2019s asset base started to increase. We are very sure that in India we will see that, and frankly at Reliance Mutual Fund we are very focused on investor education.</p> <p>We do believe that investor education is the best way of attracting long-term money. In fact, as we speak, we have launched India\u2019s first five-year lock-in product. It is a close ended product, and investors cannot redeem before five years. It\u2019s very difficult for us to sell, because all investors want liquidity.</p> <p>However, we have decided to invest a lot of effort and money into promoting this product, and though it might be very small in terms of size, we do believe that this is the best way of getting investors invested in our equities from a longer-term perspective.</p> <p>To cut it short, we are in a nascent state of the economy in the financial services concern, investors are definitely looking at financial assets. We need our economy and the markets to start to grow, and we also need a lot of effort as far as investor education is concerned, and that would definitely, definitely increase the penetration of equity, which is right now one or two percent of the savings, to at least 10 percent of savings.</p> <p>I\u2019m mindful of your time. I know I have to let you go in a second, but I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask you. This report will go live one week before almost 100,000 people around the world\u2026well, a little short of 100,000 people, but not that short, take the CFA level one exam.</p> <p>This is an organization that\u2019s changed quite a bit probably since you took the level one exam, and I wonder if you could just sort of hit quickly on what we\u2019re doing in India, and how it\u2019s come to change as a percentage of what we care about as CFA Institute?</p> <p>Right, see again, I know India that way is a very interesting country, young guys, and I mentioned the demographics because we have a huge young population in India. They are always eager to learn, and focus on education, even from parents, is very, very high. If you see CFA\u2019s own, you can say, progress in India, almost on word-of-mouth, we have grown from maybe 20, 30 students, to almost 30 to 40,000 candidates in different levels.</p> <p>What it basically demonstrates is that one \u2014 yes, the economy itself has grown to among the top five economies in the world. Second \u2014 financial services is a very, very key component. In fact, services as a percentage of GDP, and total services, is almost 55 percent in India, so we are a service oriented economy. We are an English-speaking economy\u2026English is a world language, so that also makes it easy.</p> <p>Most important is that the quality which the CFA Institute is offering is now getting interest from the students who are eager to\u2026or even professionals who are eager to further their careers through the help of an internationally academic course. Things are quite well. In the near-term, obviously the sharp depreciation in currency has made the course a little expensive, but it\u2019s a matter of time before the currency also stabilizes, and you consider prospects also start to recognize that.</p> <p>As India\u2019s Society, obviously I\u2019m no more associated with them on a day-to-day basis, but the India Society is doing a wonderful job. We have now events almost all over the country. It is providing young professionals an opportunity to keep on focusing on continuing professional education. It\u2019s a great networking tool. There is a special cell for job assistance, and even level three pass-outs are encouraged to attend those events.</p> <p>All in all, there\u2019s a great potential for a good investment oriented course, and the CFA curriculum definitely fill that. It\u2019s exciting times, and this growth can continue for a long, long time.</p> <p>Wonderful. Thank you so much for contributing to this Inside Investing special report, and I really appreciate it.</p> <p>Thank you Sloane, thanks for having me here.</p>","tags":["interviews","emerging markets","macro","india"]},{"location":"blog/2013/12/03/indias-important-diaspora/","title":"India\u2019s Important Diaspora","text":"<p>This post was written for CFA Institute and first published on the Enterprising Investor.\u00a0</p> <p>One cannot consider India without thinking about the massive impact that its language and culture have had abroad. Many common English words \u2014 among them, \u201cthug,\u201d \u201cshampoo,\u201d and \u201cpundit\u201d\u2014 have their origins in languages from the subcontinent.</p> <p>That\u2019s not much to go on for an investing website though. Many things are culturally relevant, yet do not directly affect the evolution of value in business. This is different.</p> <p>For one thing, consider the rise of India as an outsourcing hub. Why is it that India was particularly well suited for that activity? Beyond being suitable, why was it chosen? For more depth on these questions, I turned to Anita Raghavan, the author of\u00a0The Billionaire\u2019s Apprentice, a book that chronicles the rise of\u00a0Rajat Gupta, former managing director of McKinsey, and\u00a0Raj Rajaratnam, founder of The Galleon Group.</p> <p>If those names are familiar, it is because they are at the center of one of the largest insider trading scandals in history. However, Gupta was perhaps as influential as anyone else in promoting the rise of India as an offshoring hub. Along with Anil Kumar, he was \u201cthe face of McKinsey in India.\u201d</p> <p>Though the crimes these men committed are deplorable and inseparable from their stories, there is also a lot to be learned about India from them.</p> <p>Sloane Ortel: We\u2019re here with Anita Raghavan, contributor to the\u00a0New York Times, particularly its\u00a0Dealbook website, as well as to\u00a0Forbes.</p> <p>We\u2019re talking about her book\u00a0The Billionaire\u2019s Apprentice, which is both the story of the rise of Indian American elite and the fall of the Galleon hedge fund.</p> <p>Anita, you close the book with, \u201cAs tragic and heartbreaking as Gupta\u2019s fall from grace is\u2026\u201d \u2014 Gupta, of course, being a key player in this \u2014 \u201c\u2026it is a sign that Indians, much like the immigrant groups before them, have attained a certain security and a once unimaginable position in America\u2019s society.\u201d</p> <p>Can you expand on that?</p> <p>Anita Raghavan:\u00a0When I was growing up in the United States in the 70s most of the Indians we knew were doctors, lawyers, and professors.</p> <p>What we see today is Indians in all walks of life. We have Indian filmmakers, Indian lawyers, Indian prosecutors, Indian authors, Indian businessmen.</p> <p>I recently was Googling and I saw that there is even an Indian visioner. Someone pays an Indian woman to provide her vision of the world.</p> <p>When I was growing up in the 70s, the idea that anybody would pay anyone from India to provide a perspective on the globe was just unimaginable.</p> <p>I really think that while this is a very sobering story and it\u2019s certainly heartbreaking for Gupta\u2019s family, it is really a sign that we as a community are no longer on the fringes of society.</p> <p>We\u2019re part of American society. We\u2019re part of the fabric. We\u2019re standing up and we\u2019re being counted.</p> <p>One of the stories you have in \u201cGupta\u2019s Rise,\u201d I don\u2019t know if it was about him or about someone else, but a partner was saying, \u201cYou guys are great consultants, but will our customers ever relate to you?\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s so much of a concern anymore.</p> <p>Exactly. Yesterday I was speaking to a group and a young man who had been at Penn in the mid 80s came up to me and he said, \u201cWhen I joined the University of Pennsylvania in 1986, somebody asked me, \u2018Where are you from?'\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said, \u2018India.'\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe person responded, \u2018What tribe?'\u201d</p> <p>I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to find that today.</p> <p>Yeah, exactly.</p> <p>Today, Indians have a cultural identity. There was even a sitcom based on the Indian offshoring model. Indian food is enjoyed. It\u2019s a very different picture than what it was just 20 years ago.</p> <p>Yeah, exactly. To harp on what it was, what about the process of getting over here from India, this is not like just a random group of Indians. This is the best and brightest of the entire country. I mean, the process to apply for a visa, how competitive was that?</p> <p>Oh, absolutely. Both Gupta and my own father came on an F1 student visa. In those days, the only way you could get an F1 student visa is if you either found an American university to pay for your education or you could pay for it yourself. Most Indians back then couldn\u2019t pay for it themselves, so they were completely reliant on US institutions to fund their schooling in this country.</p> <p>It was phenomenally difficult, and of course, today Indians are being brought to the US not just for study but to work. There\u2019s a whole new class of visa, the HB1 visa, which brings Indians over to do particular sorts of jobs, and that\u2019s a dramatic change from what it was.</p> <p>Yeah. I mean, and again, on the what it was thing, that we harp on history too much here perhaps. But I just want, to people listening at home, I mean, in 1650, this is a country that had a GDP 80 percent the size of England. That\u2019s 50 years after Queen Elizabeth died.</p> <p>Right.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that India is a country that has only recently developed prosperity or developed some competitiveness in the world. It\u2019s been a power, really, for some time.</p> <p>Right, and I, of course, am from the south of India, and we\u2019d always talked about our 5,000 year culture and which temples and wealth that was born far before America gained independence. I think in a way, the Indian diaspora in the United States has reclaimed that legacy with their success.</p> <p>How integral is that legacy in the community itself? Is it something that people would talk about? Like, would they reference a [indecipherable 05:33] that\u2019s not been able to name a single prominent Indian leader but from ancient history, tell stories of these people or not so much?</p> <p>No, I don\u2019t think it was as obvious as that, but I think it was an inner confidence that we had that we actually deserved a preeminent place in this world. Perhaps because of the struggles of the Indian economy, after independence, we had been robbed of that place.</p> <p>That makes a lot of sense. You see, I guess, elements of involvement with the country. In the story of Galleon Group and Raja Rajaratnam, him, of course being Sri Lankan, giving a speech at a benefit after a typhoon in Sri Lanka. It was an impassioned speech about how hedge fund managers and fishermen are the same. You see that deep level of involvement.</p> <p>I think across the diaspora both with the Sri Lankan, Rodger Putnam, but also with the Indians, I think one of the big drivers behind Rajat Gupta, who\u2019s the central protagonist of my story, was this desire to help his countrymen back home.</p> <p>Some would even argue that may have precipitated his crime because when he came to New York City, he got involved in philanthropy in a big way. He started trying to raise money for Indian causes. One in particular, the American India Foundation.</p> <p>When he first set that up, he crisscrossed the country and all that he could come up with was $50,000. I think he was just so taken aback that here was this wealthy diaspora and all they could produce was a pittance.</p> <p>On some level, I think he was tired of collecting checks and he wanted to be the one writing checks. What better way to do that than to be a billionaire?</p> <p>It is certainly an easy way to be able to cut a big check. One thing I want to touch on also is a cultural element. It may not be too easy to appreciate is just the importance of skin color in Indian. I spent time there. I was struck by the prevalence of skin lightening cream.</p> <p>That\u2019s right.</p> <p>It\u2019s $500 million annual sales industry. Raj Rajaratnam, very dark skin \u2014 did that affect him in anyway?</p> <p>I think that\u2019s why when I approached the story, I always thought the friendship between Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, and Raj Rajaratnam on the other side, was a forced marriage.</p> <p>It was not a natural friendship. The Indian community, as you say, is very much like the African American community. There is a premium on light skin. I think that on some level, Gupta and Kumar were only friends with Raj because of what he could offer, which of course was a clear path to money.</p> <p>For Raj, I think there was a deep insecurity that came from his skin color. I think it really drove him. In his early days, friends remember he would say, \u201cLook at me. I\u2019m a dark, dark man, an ultimate outsider, but I\u2019ve become the ultimate insider.\u201d</p> <p>I think he took great pride in that. Here was someone on the fringes of society who had actually managed to penetrate its inner sanctum.</p> <p>Yeah, that\u2019s a big deal. This place he\u2019s coming from. At one point, there\u2019s a chapter called \u201cOffshorestan\u201d in this, which can neatly encapsulate the way a lot of people thought and perhaps still think about India.</p> <p>I mean there are a couple of great anecdotes. When McKinsey set up its office in New Delhi,\u00a0a partner had to install the switchboard because India didn\u2019t have anybody capable of doing that. That would seem to not be the case anymore.</p> <p>Yes, I think India has come a long way from the early 90s when McKinsey set up its flagship office. That\u2019s another way the diaspora was actually able to give back to India, because of Offshorestan.</p> <p>The growth of the outsourcing business of legal services, business services, was a real driver of India\u2019s economic growth during the 90s, was promoted to a large extent by the Indians in the United States who said, \u201cHey, we know what county can provide some of the data skills that the US needs.\u201d</p> <p>India, it has a large English speaking workforce. We\u2019re hungry to work for pennies on the dollar. They basically created this new state, if you will.</p> <p>They created this new state and it\u2019s grown. We recently hired Cognizant Technologies to do some IT work for us. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the sort of thing that you would have seen 20 years ago.</p> <p>I guess it raises the question, what is India now? I mean it\u2019s no longer Offshorestan. The rupee is down quite a bit. Can it be Offshorestan again or has it lost that essential cost advantage that it used to have?</p> <p>I think it has lost the essential cost advantage on the plain vanilla offshoring business. One of the great advantages of India and its people is that they are both highly numeric and they speak English, which is a rare quality.</p> <p>You either get highly numeric or you can speak English.</p> <p>You don\u2019t get both in one package.</p> <p>Exactly.</p> <p>I think what India now needs to do is redouble its efforts to go higher up the food chain to get some of the more sophisticated outsourcing business that can flow from the western economies.</p> <p>Indeed, perhaps produce its own stuff. I was hoping that we would see a Tata Nano cruising around the streets of New York City, at some point.</p> <p>Right.</p> <p>As yet, no.</p> <p>As yet, no.</p> <p>I mean a $2,000 car would be pretty great. That\u2019s a place where people understand that make things at low cost.</p> <p>Absolutely. The high-end offshoring business is still a small sliver of what India exports. There\u2019s real room for growth in that. It comes at a time when US companies are still driving to cut costs. I think that could be at the next leg.</p> <p>The one certainty in business: cost cutting.</p> <p>Right, exactly.</p> <p>This is a story about insider trading and fraud, as well as India. I need to ask, are those bad?</p> <p>Insider trading and fraud. Look, I was speaking at the branch library over the weekend. Someone raised the very legitimate question of why is insider trading a crime because there are no victims. There are no discernible victims.</p> <p>I think insider trading is important because one of the reasons that the US market is so respected the world over is because there\u2019s a sense that ordinary investors get a fair shake.</p> <p>They have access to the same information that the big boys do. You really don\u2019t see any capital market that\u2019s as liquid and as deep as the American market. I think in large part it is because it\u2019s a transparent market.</p> <p>Even though, there is some work to be done here. Do you have a sense that there\u2019s a pervasive level of insider trading or there\u2019s still a bunch of Raj Rajaratnams out there, calling up people at Intel, having them fax documents?</p> <p>I think it goes in waves, Will. I think the last big insider trading case that we had before this one was, of course, memorialized in the book \u201cDen of Thieves\u201d and involved a number of bankers at some of the most prominent Wall Street firms, such as Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, and that was all the way back in the late 80s.</p> <p>I think memories are not long. Certainly after Regulation FD, at the turn of the millennium, which really created a level playing field between big institutions and small investors in terms of the information they received from companies.</p> <p>After that was put in place, I do think that short-term event-driven funds, momentum funds, found it a lot harder to make money and started resorting to insider trading as a way to get an edge.</p> <p>If these guys obviously trading on the stuff minute-to-minute and not what you would call long term investors, necessarily.</p> <p>That\u2019s right.</p> <p>It\u2019s tough to have an edge on one thing, having an edge on 60 stocks a year, 100 stocks a year. Very, very tough.</p> <p>It\u2019s tough to have an edge in efficient markets.</p> <p>Yeah, really on anything, especially if you\u2019re not a very smart man, as certain of us interviewing you are not.</p> <p>Another thing I find curious. You interviewed Jeff Skilling a lot. He might not jump off the page to other people but was the President of Enron, I think or CEO?</p> <p>The CEO.</p> <p>The CEO of Enron. What is it like to reach out to somebody who has been, basically, in prison for fraud for what must be a decade at this point?</p> <p>Almost, almost a decade. One of the reasons I reached out to Jeff Skilling is that I was looking for people to tell me why Rajat Gupta got elected to the helm of McKinsey not just once but three times.</p> <p>Of course, by the time the charges surrounding Gupta were brought, no one at McKinsey, no one who even knew him, wanted to speak on the record. There was nothing good to say about Rajat Gupta.</p> <p>We all know, no one is black and white. I thought, \u201cwho might talk to me?\u201d I thought, \u201cWell, maybe Jeff Skilling will.\u201d</p> <p>I wrote him a letter. You have to get on the prison email system. I don\u2019t know if you know this. It\u2019s called \u201cCorrLinks.\u201d</p> <p>He reached out to me on CorrLinks. He was a typical consultant. He gave me a step-by-step how to on navigating CorrLinks in case I started an email relationship with a number of prisoners. Actually, I have a couple right now.</p> <p>I found him incredibly eloquent. He would write these long emails. They were clear and articulate. Every once in a while, the reality of his new life, being in prison, would intrude on our conversation.</p> <p>One time I remember, he was trying to explain something about the structure of McKinsey, you\u2019re only allowed an hour on the Internet or on the email system, when you\u2019re in prison.</p> <p>His hour was up. He had to stop the email midway. It really was midway and come back to it several hours later.</p> <p>There was another time I wanted to share something with him and I sent him a link to a story. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t read it because we don\u2019t have access to the Internet.\u201d But he had a lot of time, and he would write these very detailed emails of Rajat, how McKinsey was structured, and some of its values. He was really perfect for history of the firm, as well.</p> <p>I always wonder if these high-powered executives who wind up in prison find themselves doing things like organizing people into cross-functional teams, or doing any of these things you might expect. Is there any sense of what his day-to-day life is like?</p> <p>He used to teach Spanish in the library. He first, I believe, started working in the library. Then he organized classes for the other prisoners in Spanish. He spent a lot of time working, at that time, on his appeal. I think one of the reasons he reached out and decided to speak to me is because he saw the Gupta case, not the Kumar case \u2014 he was very clear about this \u2014 he saw the Gupta case as a sign of the Justice Department overreaching.</p> <p>Really? Overreaching?</p> <p>He drew a distinction because with Anil Kumar, just to recollect the facts for a minute, Anil Kumar was paid by Raj Rajaratnam to give insider trading tips about companies like AMD, and Jeff Skilling thought this was abominable. But Rajat Gupta, where the dominance case was based on circumstantial evidence, Rajat Gupta was someone that Skilling felt was railroaded by the government. That\u2019s why he decided to speak to me.</p> <p>Really? That\u2019s a very interesting thing. He must be feeling the same about himself, to some extent.</p> <p>Of course, of course, of course.</p> <p>No, no, that goes without saying. That goes without saying. He was very careful about not talking about his own legal case, but it goes without saying that he certainly does not feel that justice has done him proud.</p> <p>We actually got a copy of the original Enron code of ethics that\u00a0we blogged about on Inside Investing\u00a0a couple of days ago. It was really quite a fascinating read. \u201cNo corporate employee shall trade the stock,\u201d but of course, there are stock tickers in the elevator.</p> <p>Right.</p> <p>Jeff Skilling, Rajat Gupta, is something in the water at McKinsey? What\u2019s going on? Is that a thing or is that not a thing?</p> <p>McKinsey, for most of its history, had been built on this honor-driven value culture, which, of course, was espoused by its long-time managing director, Marvin Bower. Honor-driven, values-driven might have worked when you were a small partnership and everyone sitting in a room could look everyone else in the eye and know what they were about.</p> <p>Today, McKinsey is a global firm. I think one of the problems the firm encountered is that it had grown so much in the 1990s, but its policies, its procedures, had not kept up with the phenomenal growth.</p> <p>It had growth pains, and then, \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p> <p>Right.</p> <p>In the aftermath of this whole thing \u2014 it\u2019s no longer a headline everyday \u2014 a lot of times when people ask you about this book they go, \u201cFor heavens sake, couldn\u2019t you find a good story?\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. When I started writing this book a couple years ago, I went to a black tie gala in London and I met a prominent executive of a Wall Street firm. He said, [Indian dialect] \u201cAnita, of all the books you could write, couldn\u2019t you write a positive book about the diaspora?\u201d</p> <p>It is of some frustration to the Indian community that this book captures an unfortunate episode in what has been a remarkable rise of Indians in the United States. But I think it is an important story because one of the reasons Indians are so respected and held in high esteem in this country is because we are known to be hard working, diligent, and generally deliver on what we promise.</p> <p>Blemishes on the diaspora, like this, risk threatening our reputation. That\u2019s why it was important for me to write the book.</p> <p>Also, as we talked about at the very beginning this notion that not everyone is perfect and the hardest-working person ever probably helps the community more than it hurts it in the long term.</p> <p>I think so, I think so. It shows that we have matured and we\u2019re at a point where we even have our own crime. That must mean we\u2019ve finally arrived.</p> <p>People actually think it\u2019s worth their while to prosecute the Indian community for crimes. Whereas, when I was growing up in the 1970s, we were too small a community to matter.</p> <p>Of course, that the people doing the prosecution were also Indian-American says about as much as could be said.</p> <p>That\u2019s right. The official at the SEC who built up the Galleon case, Sanjay Wadhwa, and of course the US Attorney for the southern district, Preet Bharara, both Indian Americans, and are a sign of how variegated the role of Indian Americans is in American society today.</p>","tags":["interviews","sri lanka","emerging markets","india"]},{"location":"blog/2013/12/04/is-corporate-india-healthy/","title":"Is Corporate India Healthy?","text":"<p>As we continue our special coverage of India, it becomes important to ask the obvious: How are Indian companies doing?</p> <p>For that, we turn to the chief investment officer of SBI Mutual funds,\u00a0Navneet Munot, CFA.</p> <p>I am looking at a report from the Reserve Bank of India that says corporate profitability\u00a0\u2014 this is a broad group of corporations in India \u2014 is down about 2%. Now it\u2019s still big \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s one crore, 74 lakh crore rupees\u00a0\u2014 but how does this make you feel about business fundamentals in India? Is it still a rosy picture?</p> <p>Navneet Munot, CFA: \u00a0There is a part of economy that has been\u00a0impacted more badly, and that is the investment side of it. So companies in industrials and infrastructure, those are the ones who got impacted. But if you look at the latest results, there is another set of companies that have benefited from a weaker rupee. So those who are exporters, those who are into information technology, pharmaceuticals, engineering \u2014\u00a0they have benefited because of the weaker rupee.</p> <p>There has been pressure, particularly in the financial sector, because given the downturn, there has been stress [over] the asset quality of the banking system. So financials have been a bit under pressure; though the banks are financial services company who cater to the retail market, they seemed to be chugging along well because the overall retail delinquencies have not increased much in this downturn.</p> <p>By and large, I think the corporate profitability is bottoming out. Two things that kept pressure:\u00a0One was that lot of people who expanded capacity, extrapolating the 9% growth that we were witnessing till 2008, came for a shock when the growth fell and the global environment turned very negative.</p> <p>For them, there is lot of capacity which\u00a0is yet to come on stream and then generate revenues and also because of the government\u2019s slow decision making and [because] the political environment has resulted in lots of infrastructure projects which\u00a0are at the last mile from lack of environmental clearance \u2014 land acquisition or forest clearance or several ministry bureaucratic clearances and they have been pending.</p> <p>So that got impacted and also the pressure on margins because the raw material prices went through the roof, the labor cost in India was going up in excess of 15% and 20%, interest cost was going up, currency was weakening, so they got impacted on margins. But from here on, I believe, as the cycle turns, the asset turnover improves, and also the pressure on margin recedes, I see better days ahead for corporate profitability.</p> <p>I just want to drill in on one of those comments, which is, you mentioned basically companies that have dollar revenues and rupee expenses as being a particular bright point in this environment. Does that signal a return to sort of offshoring and business process outsourcing-based competitive structure for India, or is that just sort of a short-term thing?</p> <p>I think that\u2019s quite structural because [when] all is said and done, India has an\u00a0advantage in terms of having a large English-speaking, educated talent pool and the cost pressure has receded for them, while the global environment has turned positive with the growth reviving in the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>These companies have benefited, and also the rupee depreciation obviously is helping them. But we have other sectors who\u00a0lost competitiveness between, let\u2019s say, 2005 and 2008\u20132009, when our economy was doing very well, the labor cost and, as I previously mentioned, I think, the cost structure went up and the rupee was strong, so they lost competitiveness.</p> <p>But we are seeing a renewed way of thrust on getting the competitiveness back and several sectors. Autos is a classic example, and we saw the two\u2011wheeler companies \u2014 the Bajaj Auto and then some others. We are gaining the market share in the world market.</p> <p>Similarly, several companies in auto ancillaries and in engineering particularly \u2014\u00a0there are other factors where India has the advantage of R&amp;D skills and low-cost labor. Across sectors, a weak rupee is likely to help corporate India.</p> <p>You are talking about the changing international investment climate. That\u2019s something that has fascinated me as I have kept digging into India. I wonder if you could comment on flows a little bit. How important and how closely you\u2019re a domestic Indian investor, how closely are you watching international investors in equities and their flows in and out of the market, how material is that to you?</p> <p>They have been extraordinarily important because what happens is that foreign institutional investors now almost own 22% or so of the market cap of India. If you have adjusted for the floating stock \u2014\u00a0because a large part of the market cap is with the promoters, be it the government or the private entrepreneurs or some of the multinational companies,\u00a0they own a substantial chunk of the floating stock. They are a large part of the daily volumes, and their flows dictate the market.</p> <p>To put it simply, we dance to the tune of global investors who get, in turn, driven by the global liquidity and the global risk environment. Why it is that because we run a large current account deficit, obviously the country needs a huge amount of capital flows. The flows by these foreign investors impact the currency market, impact liquidity, and interest rates here and impact the sentiment in the equity market as well.</p> <p>In the last couple of years, the domestic savings \u2014\u00a0India has a very high household savings rate, but unfortunately a large part of that saving effect is not coming into the financial instruments but going into real assets like real estate and gold. The domestic investors are becoming very marginal players in the equity market, and that\u2019s why the foreign investors, their flows, make all the difference.</p> <p>If you can do a chart of last 15 or 20 years, every single year where foreign investors poured in money, the markets did well. In every year where foreign investors were sellers, market didn\u2019t do well.</p> <p>But I hope that going forward, domestic investors will start reallocating their savings into equities as\u00a0equities are relatively becoming more attractive compared to the other asset classes and that equation may change going forward. But as of now, foreign investors are a very, very critical variable in the overall direction of our equity markets.</p> <p>I want to pick up on the current account deficit thought in a second, but first I want to go to the comment you had about domestic investors. Now, what really needs to happen in order to spur that growth in a domestic shareholder base basically? Is that something that\u2019s just like a last-mile problem, similar to those infrastructure projects, or is that really a big challenge?</p> <p>A variety of things. In the last 20\u201325 years, domestic investors \u2014 just like anywhere else in the world, they came at the peak of the market.\u00a0They didn\u2019t have the experience with the equities. There were some structural flaws in the system where probably the retail investors didn\u2019t make money.</p> <p>Also, India didn\u2019t have a very sustained long\u2011term bull market. We had markets that delivered exceptional return; next to the year 1992 are the years 1999, 2000, and then 2006\u20132007, but unfortunately, the retail investors came at the peak. They had bad experience, and generally, equity is still perceived as something that\u00a0is very speculative.</p> <p>Another structural factor is that we don\u2019t have enough of 401(k) type pension plans or all the retirement savings infrastructure in place, where a good part of savings automatically go into the equity market, like in the US and some of the other parts of the world. India needs to get that right. The pension reforms have just begun, and I hope that over a longer period, given the demographics and the high savings rate, people will start investing a lot more into equity.</p> <p>Though the infrastructure now is in place, I think in terms of whether the settlement cycle \u2014\u00a0in terms of dematerialization, the overall infrastructure of the stock exchange, corporate governance, the regulation \u2014 everything is in place, but somehow, as you mentioned, the last mile. People will need to be educated, and given the importance of the equity in their overall savings portfolio, to get inflation adjusted at times, once that is done, a lot of money can come into the market.</p> <p>Another interesting feature is that two other asset classes where people have put money in the last 10\u201315 years \u2014 real estate and gold \u2014 both have done phenomenally well, even adjusted for the volatility and liquidity. That\u2019s why [there is] this perception that it is always better to put money in real estate rather than a paper asset. That needs to change. Hopefully, I think it will change over a period of time.</p> <p>I just want to underscore for the audience that investing in gold is not just a 15-year-old trend in India.\u00a0It seems like to me a 2,000- or 10,000-year-old trend. There is a cultural focus on doing that that may not be very clear to an international base of investors.</p> <p>Yeah, but in last couple of years, [it has] increased significantly as a percentage of our GDP: Gold imports just shot through the roof for the simple reasons that real interest rates were negative and consumer inflation was running much higher than the policy rates.\u00a0And that led people into more physical assets, and then also something to do with the cycle that in the last decade, at least in the rupee terms, because the rupee deficit people made good money in gold.</p> <p>Also another reason that \u2014\u00a0I am an Indian, so I have had a fascination for gold for 2,000 years, but having said that, in the last 20 years, we have built a very good financial market. We have built good infrastructure in terms of whether it\u2019s banks or mutual funds, insurance companies who are reaching out to millions of investors. But still, the proportion of savings coming into financial assets has declined, particularly in last three four years, which is a bit worrisome for the policymakers and for us.</p> <p>That gets back to the current account deficit thought. I was actually just listening to Mr Shanmugaratnam \u2014 the head of the Monetary Authority of Singapore \u2014 talk about the role that a current account deficit can play. He makes the point that a current account deficit in and of itself is not intrinsically bad.</p> <p>Do you see the lighter side of a current account deficit, or is it the sort of thing that you and perhaps the market more broadly are viewing as kind of holding India back?</p> <p>As long as it\u2019s manageable, as long as it doesn\u2019t create extraordinary pressure on the currency market, it doesn\u2019t lead to destabilization in financial markets, it doesn\u2019t lead to some kind of instability in the overall macroeconomic environment, and it saw the signs between June and August when the Fed announced \u2014 or probably the Fed announced \u2014 the intention of tapering and the massive impact it could have not only on the financial markets in India but also on the sentiment in the real economy.</p> <p>The current account deficit, it is a point where the funding becomes a day-to-day challenge that is quite worrisome. But a 1%\u20132% of current account deficit for a country like India, which needs to invest more than private saving, it is largely in order. If you think from a global perspective, a few countries have to run the current account deficit; if everybody runs current account surplus, it is building reserves. I think that may not be good.</p> <p>Yeah, that\u2019s definitely true. In places that need investment, that\u2019s OK, that\u2019s what a current account deficit is. You brought up the word \u201ctapering.\u201d I wanted to ask you, just how often do you think about that word? Because here in New York, we think about it quite a bit. But on the other side of the world, it may not be obvious how important is to you.</p> <p>We hear almost the same [as] what people sitting in New York [hear] because, ultimately, our markets are governed by what people in New York think. As I have mentioned earlier, the foreign investors are extremely critical for us, for the equity market, for currency, and for, recently, the bond market as well.</p> <p>Tapering \u2014 at least in the very near term \u2014\u00a0makes some impact, but longer term, if you look at last 20 year,s every time the US Fed was increasing interesting rates or the US Federal Reserve was tightening its\u00a0policy, it turned out to be good for the Indian markets.</p> <p>The first few days or first few weeks, markets would tend to react negatively because that would mean less liquidity available in the market, but over a longer period, if the US economy is doing well, I think that generally augurs well for the Indian economy.</p> <p>One is the trade linkages, probably whether it\u2019s IT export, health care, or some of the other industries. And over a longer period, there is a bit of correlation between the Indian IFT [Institute of Foreign Trade], the Index of Industrial Production, and the US ISM [Institute for Supply Management], which may be 3\u2011 to 6-month lag. So, a revival in global growth is generally good for India.</p> <p>But the market takes a few weeks to realize that fact, and then the first reaction, just in line with every other market in the world when Mr. Bernanke or Ms. Yellen talks about tapering, people perceive it a bit negatively. But my sense is that once the tapering starts, eventually it helps to be adding; if it is driven by strength in the US economy, I think that should be good for the Indian economy and markets.</p> <p>Does the same linkage apply to other monetary zones, or would you say that you are concerned with things coming out of the ECB [European Central Bank] as you might be with things coming out the Fed?</p> <p>If I remember correctly, it was January and February 2012 when it\u00a0announced\u00a0the\u00a0LTRO [long-term refinancing operation], and the Indian market, despite an extremely challenging micro and political environment, markets went up 25% and for no reason but just that the ECB showed signs of printing a lot of money and then the LTRO money came into India.</p> <p>We get a lot more impacted by global liquidity, the global central bank stance, and global risk on/risk off sentiments. They impact a lot our markets, at least in the very near term. Of course, in the longer term, logically it is corporate fundamentals and economic fundamentals that should drive the market, but in the interim, I think it\u2019s the global liquidity that impacts a lot.</p> <p>I want to ask, is it challenging in that case to sort of search for value among these equities? And if you are in this environment where you have this essentially tidal international investor sentiment, how does that frustrate your hunt for adequate risk/reward for your investors inside of the country?</p> <p>It actually also creates an opportunity for a domestic investor. Somebody who has a slightly longer-term horizon and he can, rather than getting trade by the volatility which is induced by the behavior of global investors. Sometimes it creates good opportunity, so if these markets are rising just because the global liquidity environment is improving, you can be on the other side of the fence rather than vice versa. It creates an opportunity for those who can take advantage of the differential arbitrage.</p> <p>Another aspect is that, in the last five years, we would have gotten more than $80 billion from foreign investors, while the domestic investors have continuously been selling in the market. Now a large part of this money, or a bulk of this money, has chased around 50 or 60 odd stocks, and it has created a valuation gap between so-called defensives and the cyclicals.</p> <p>Some of the stocks that foreigners are chasing \u2014 the large mega-caps within the consumer, health care, IT, and in some of the private sector retail banks \u2014 the valuations have risen there, while the rest of the market, because the domestic investors are not buying the cyclicals, had become a lot cheaper. Now I am seeing a trend where the domestic investors are focusing on finding value within those stocks which are neglected by the foreign investors.</p> <p>Talking about finding value, there is obviously the chase for value through all the listed equities, but I think if you reach into your wallet, I assume that there are some rupees there. Is that a source of worry, a source of confidence, both, or neither? It hasn\u2019t been an easy 18 months for you probably.</p> <p>Yeah, basically for Indians, gold is a dollar as such somehow because if the domestic one is not doing well and you have higher inflation, then through the weakened currency, you get the benefit in your investment and in gold.</p> <p>Maybe people don\u2019t talk about it, but subconsciously, it is the global diversification. Talking about as an individual, your expenses are in rupee and then you are running in rupee, and the last couple of years, the income growth has been in line with the nominal GDP growth. So, people are that way, OK. We haven\u2019t seen investors really chasing and trying to diversify into global assets or investing overseas. We haven\u2019t seen that trend catching up.</p> <p>One of the comments in doing this research that really surprised me came from Pradip Shah when he said that the [Reserve Bank of India]\u00a0now views its job as protecting the purchasing power of currency, which again sounds a bit weird here in New York. Is that your perception?\u00a0Is that translating into action to really defend the rupee? And if so, is that action viewed as credible in the market?</p> <p>Exchange rate has not been a major factor driving the monetary policy for several years, but I think there are periods when the bouts of volatility in the exchange market lead the central bank to take monetary action.</p> <p>Having said that, the stated objective over the years has been that they want to contain volatility rather than protecting a certain level of the currency. Two things that have been a lot of the point is there \u2014 the currency will be stable if perceived inflation is well behaved, and the new governor Mr. Rajan, he has been very clear on two things.</p> <p>One is that the primary target has to be containing inflation, and not only the wholesale inflation because that gets driven by global commodities, but the consumer inflation that impacts every household. And second is India needs to rebuild savings, so the real rates have to stay positive for some time to induce savers to come back into financial assets, to come back into deposits.</p> <p>That\u2019s why we need slightly higher rates, while the government and businesses have been clamoring for the lower interest rates to support growth. He thinks that we need a balance between these objectives.</p> <p>That\u2019s it. Switching over to sort of a debt outlook, I\u2019ve heard some chatter about a downgrade, a debt downgrade, for India the country. My country got downgraded not too long ago, and everything seems to be very much the same. Is that something that seems likely plausible or overblown?\u00a0What are your feelings on that?</p> <p>Two aspects \u2014 one is that the actual event of India getting downgraded to a junk status, I think, is very, very remote. The macrofundamentals are reasonably strong, and they don\u2019t justify that India should be in the junk category.</p> <p>If you look at the public debt to GDP, if you look at the \u2014 there are hardly any implicit liabilities of the government, unlike most of the other parts of the world, where a very little pension liability or medical liabilities that the government has. And also, I think, even the demographic, the growth potential, the overall strength of the financial sector at a very low leverage among the households \u2014\u00a0the household balance sheets are very strong.</p> <p>By and large, corporate balance sheets are in reasonably decent shape. India getting downgraded to junk is very, very remote, I would say. Having said that, I remember one good thing that has happened because of the threat of the downgrade; [it] has done lot of good to the country in a sense that the central government, despite this being an election year, it has been behaving very sensibly on the fiscal side because it knows that the sword of downgrade is hanging on us.</p> <p>Because of that, the fiscal deficit has been under control, and serious reforms to consolidate the fiscal side, the budget deficit, began a year back. And I think some part would have been played by the threat of the sovereign rating downgrade of India.</p> <p>Also, lots of reforms are taking place in the financial sector. The government has taken a lot of steps to revive growth and contain deficit. That\u2019s a good aspect of this threat. But the actual event, I\u2019ll be highly surprised. I\u2019ll be shocked if S&amp;P [Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s] takes the step and says that India doesn\u2019t deserve an investment grade.</p> <p>One more aspect that people neglect is that the bulk of the Indian government\u2019s borrowing is in the domestic market. It\u00a0has borrowed from the domestic banks and the households, and it\u00a0has not borrowed overseas. That way, the vulnerability of India defaulting to global investors is hardly there. I\u2019ll be very surprised if that event takes place. That\u2019s a little overblown in that sense.</p> <p>That is certainly, probably, refreshing news to many investors. Navneet, thank you so much for joining us.</p> <p>If you enjoyed this, you should sign up for my newsletter.</p>","tags":["interviews","india"]},{"location":"blog/2013/12/05/building-an-india-resistant-to-currency-shocks-and-inflation/","title":"Building an India Resistant to Currency Shocks and Inflation","text":"<p>This was written for CFA Institute and first published on the Enterprising Investor. </p> <p>Inflation, currency shocks, and their unequal impact on the Indian population as a whole have been brought up repeatedly in this week\u2019s\u00a0coverage of India.</p> <p>In part one of a two-part interview with\u00a0Pradip Shah, the founding managing director of Crisil, Chairman at IndAsia Fund Advisors, and a board member at several India-based companies, we discuss how India has recovered from currency shocks, how it might recover further, and the progress of various initiatives that have been undertaken to mitigate the impact of those factors on India\u2019s vast population living in poverty.\u00a0Subscribe\u00a0to ensure you don\u2019t miss part two, and consider attending the India Investment conference if your schedule accommodates.</p> <p>CFA Institute: Pradip, India is perhaps unique in that it\u2019s a country that\u2019s raising rates to try and to control inflation.\u00a0From where I\u2019m sitting in New York, and maybe from where the Fed governors are sitting across the country, some inflation would be OK for us as long as it got us some growth. How do you see the growth-inflation trade-off in India? Is it the same sort of consideration?</p> <p>Pradip Shah: At this time, there is\u00a0certainly a trade off. They are addressing inflation in a manner that is depressing growth because the Reserve Bank of India has taken on\u00a0all the burden of fighting inflation, through tight money and dear monetary policy.</p> <p>As a consequence, because of high interest rates,\u00a0we\u2019ve seen a slow down of big ticket purchases by consumers, such as housing, or consumer durables or automobiles, and so on.</p> <p>Not only that, tight monetary policy has discouraged investment. We had, at one time I think, 38 percent of the GDP in Investment, which has probably fallen well \u00a0below 30 percent now. That\u2019s not good for an economy which needs a lot of infrastructure development and possesses a lot of investment possibility.</p> <p>We have population\u00a0growth; we have an underserved population with infrastructure being very poor, whether it\u2019s public transport, roads, whether it\u2019s irrigation of water for both urban as well as rural, and so on. There are a lot of investments that can take place, but it does get inhibited by higher interest rates.</p> <p>One of the things that you mentioned is that, the central bank sort of sees its role as being the guardian of the purchasing power of the currency. There\u2019s been some volatility in the rupee \u00a0to say the least. How should we been looking at that?</p> <p>Firstly, there was a catch up provision in the rupee depreciation. Between 1991, when we had the big bang of reforms, and 2001, the Indian currency depreciated by about 4.6 percent per year. The 10 years thereafter it depreciated only by about 2.6 per year. If you even extend it to early August, the depreciation was about 2.7 percent.</p> <p>Now, 2.7 percent per year is less than the interest rate differential. There is an inflation differential between the dollar economy, and the Indian rupee economy. There was a catch up. For instance, look at August 2011, just a little over two years ago: the rupee appreciated to about 38 rupees to the dollar, it clearly went the other way. All on the back of financial flows, and a thin currency market.</p> <p>Now, it went the other way at 68 rupees. When suddenly there was a lack of confidence triggered by the main announcement by Bernanke that they would begin to Taper QE3. Then many people started looking at all emerging markets in a different light. That caused a currency flight until the reserve bank got into the act.</p> <p>In the mean time, some of us had been screaming for import duties. Import duties were introduced on gold, which took away 60 million dollars of currency when Individuals purchased gold.</p> <p>The highest amount of gold purchases came about last year, in terms of gold being bought as ETFs, gold bouillon, bar form, non jewelry gold. This is clearly intended a store of value. People were shifting to gold, because of the inflation.</p> <p>We were arguing for import duties. Duties helped bring about current deficit reduction, but, in addition, the reserve bank took three very interesting steps which were very useful.</p> <p>Firstly, they took off 144 billion dollars of annual import demand of oil from the currency market. That dollar demand, 12 billion dollars a month, was far greater than the current account deficit. It tilted the currency market in favor of the rupee.</p> <p>Secondly, the Reserve Bank of India entered into swap arrangements with other countries. For example, it entered into a 50 billion dollar swap with the Japanese government. That\u2019s like having the Japanese government back us with 50 billion dollars in case of emergency. Of course, like reciprocity demanded, we will do the same if Japan got into a crisis. Fortunately, this worked for us, just not very well.\u00a0It gave confidence, that there was money backing the reserve that the reserve bank already had.</p> <p>Thirdly, the reserve bank opened up the foreign currency non-resident tap.</p> <p>Again, I had argued for it in a meeting with the finance governor in June, July I wrote an article along those lines. But\u00a0that governor changed and Raghuram Rajan came in, but that earlier governor announced that, Yes, we\u2019ll open up the reserve. Exactly as I suggested.</p> <p>They gave an incentive to banks to tap into the network that they already had in the Middle East, places where the\u00a0Indian Diaspora\u00a0exist in large numbers. The idea was to give the banks a little incentive by setting off liabilities and limits on foreign currency deposits.</p> <p>The governor, currently, Raghuram Rajan did one better. He said to the banks, \u201cGo out, raise money from non-resident Indians by way of foreign currency non-resident deposits, and you can swap that into rupees for 3.5 percent cost per year.\u201d Now, that was very attractive. Given the current low interest rate environment in dollars worldwide, we\u2019ve got banks that are able to borrow money at about five percent.</p> <p>They have 3.5 percent hedge cost, and the banks have an all in rupee cost at 8.5 percent, which they can easily lend out for two or three percent more than that. There\u2019s a very attractive window that\u2019s been created which brought in 10 billion dollars in one month\u2019s time. By November 30th when it ends, it will bring at least another 10 billion dollars. The reserve bank has realized that it can open the tap.</p> <p>More importantly, this signals to the market that it should not take rupee depreciation for granted. We have tools in our armory to address very sudden or spiky depreciation. Rupee depreciation hurts us. It adds to inflation.</p> <p>It fuels inflation because we import 70 percent of our oil. That\u2019s very important, because oil is needed to move the economy. Think about everything we do with diesel: from things as simple as bringing vegetables home to more complex things.</p> <p>If diesel goes up in price, of course, your inflation increases. Our whole motto, our whole objective is to control inflation. We can\u2019t allow the rupee to slide without concern. We will monitor it. The reverse bank still articulates that they don\u2019t have a target rupee dollar rate in mind, but they\u2019ve said that if it is seen to be excessive, they will control it.</p> <p>They\u2019ve brought it to around 61.5 to 62 rupees to the dollar. The government would have ideally liked it at 60. The finance minister went on record, which perhaps did a little bit of a job on the market, saying that the rupee should have been at 58 rupees to the dollar. That\u2019s a fair rate. Perhaps at 60 or 61 rupee, it would seem that the rupee has caught up with the inflation differential, and this reflects a true value in purchasing power parity.</p> <p>Unless we have a currency pull out or investment leaving or entering India in uncontrolled quantities, we should see an orderly currency movement. That\u2019s in respect to investment, again, of course. If the rupee seems to be relatively stable, if we didn\u2019t have a current account deficit, that would be wonderful. That would have been a blessing.</p> <p>But we still have a current account deficit. Having controlled the gold import, we think the current account deficit will come down to about three, 3.5 percent, from what we had at 6 percent at one time.</p> <p>Well, there are two things that I really want to pick up on there. The first that you alluded to is sort of the power of the Indian diaspora, which I think is something that is difficult to appreciate for those of us who may not be as familiar. </p> <p>Can you just sort of touch on this notion that, because of emigration trends that you\u2019ve seen as a country over the last 50 odd years, that there is this wealthy network of foreigners who may have other citizenships, but who certainly feel allied to India in some way. Do you feel that that\u2019s going to be a material driver?</p> <p>Yes. You have a wonderful opportunity in India to tap some of this Indian diaspora overseas. There is, for instance, a floating diaspora, as I say, which is in the Middle East. Which went to build the Middle East, from labor, construction labor to professional bankers, and asset managers, technical specialists, so on and so forth.</p> <p>For them to get citizenship is almost impossible.\u00a0They earn a lot, save a lot, and typically the workers all submit money to India to support their families. We have about 72 billion dollars in just remittances coming into India, which helps us in our current account. These remittances are good for household expenses of the families here.</p> <p>There is that strata of the diaspora, not only in the Middle East but also in Southeast Asia, Singapore, and Malaysia, and of course even in the Western world in the United Kingdom, the United States.</p> <p>We have a large body of, for instance, yuppies who have gone for IT services overseas. We have a large body of first generation Indians who still have family here and have close contact with family here, and who therefore have grown up on Indian household names and feel very comfortable with the names, who are not averse to putting money into safe investments in India especially in fixed income category, especially if it\u2019s denominated in the currency of their choice.</p> <p>The diaspora can be that. It\u2019s the second generation, the earlier generation which took roots in India, and then their children are born abroad. The children don\u2019t have any affinity to India, they don\u2019t think Indian. Although they may look Indian, they don\u2019t think Indian. They perhaps don\u2019t have any, as it were, longing for home.</p> <p>There was a phase when they were lost youngsters wanting to come back to India, even though they were born and brought up, for instance, in the United States, and had the best of education, Harvard and MIT, and so on.\u00a0But they wanted to work here, because India was seen about five years ago as such a great growth market, and nothing could go wrong with India, they wanted to come back to work.</p> <p>That also may happen again, if we improve the climate and livability for people in India.</p> <p>The other thing I want to drill in on, is the notion that you raised that India imports this massive amount of oil. I wonder sort of on the geo-political front, the extent to which we might see India making moves to secure access to those resources. Do you think that\u2019s a primary consideration?</p> <p>India has not gone as systemically as China has, towards securing natural resources overseas for its needs. Partly, because India does not have nearly Tree Trillion dollars of reserves. They have 300 billion dollars of reserves, which is about seven months of imports. They need to shepherd that carefully.</p> <p>What they have done,\u00a0nevertheless, is encourage public sector companies like ONGC, India Oil and Natural Gas Commission as well as for instance, Coal India, and so on, to look overseas for assets.</p> <p>For instance, we had about 85 million tons of coal imports last year. Though we have one of the largest producers of coal in the world, we will need continually increasing coal imports to power our energy requirements. We need to build up those kinds of resources, and if we had the ability to generate current account surpluses, it would be less of a problem.</p> <p>But still, we have energy dependence on overseas nations. We will need to be careful in how we\u2019re spending our resources, and buying assets overseas will help us in at least in securing our future without having to be at the mercy of our currency that goes against us all the time.</p> <p>Yeah. That can be reasonably severe. Let\u2019s talk about onions. If you\u2019re in New York, onions are 69 cents a pound, which is maybe 0.0000013 percent of annual household income. I noticed onion prices in India are up 300 percent. That would seem to be material to the average Indian person.</p> <p>Indeed. I forget the figure just now, but the amount spent by the common man, as it were, the average person in India, is roughly 31 percent on just food supplies. Other non-discretionary items like healthcare and transportation also take up a lot. Discretionary spending is much more limited than, even say, China, for instance.</p> <p>When you have such a large portion of your income being taken away by just food, and you\u2019re not eating as well as the Western world in terms of either calories or nutritional value to begin with, any food price hurts.\u00a0Don\u2019t forget we have roughly 30 percent of our population, or if the government is to be believed much less, I think it\u2019s 29 to 30 percent is fair estimate, of people living below the poverty line.</p> <p>The government has gone so far as to say \u201cLook, we have actually passed a bill, passed an act to help out the poor in India by giving them subsidized food products.\u201d That subsidy program does serve almost two-thirds of the population. When you have onion and other essential food prices rise, it is the biggest punishment or tyranny toward poor people.</p> <p>Yeah. In thinking about the subsidy programs. I remember reading a lot in \u201cThe Economist\u201d a couple years ago, about a massive identification program that was underway in India.\u00a0Is the government able to identify the people who receive the subsidies now? Is there a reasonably complicated implementation problem there, that\u2019s sort of tough to get your hands around?</p> <p>If the unique identification program is designed for subsidy, I think it needs to be tweaked. What happens today is that to get a unique identification number, you have to produce some paper or identity document which says you exist in the country.</p> <p>Even if you particularly present yourself and the system allows them to allow five biometric measurements of yours to be recorded, the government has not said that you exist!</p> <p>This stage of implementation seems wrong. It says that, \u201cOh, have you got a ration card, have you got driving license, have you got a passport, et cetera, then yes, we\u2019ll take these five biometrics, and say OK, you are the same person as the passport or whatever says.\u201d That\u2019s the way it is being implemented.</p> <p>The government wants to implement this as they implement subsidies in terms of passing this person through the UID mechanism, having identified the person.</p> <p>They would then allow the person to open the bank account, and then the money would be credited to the bank, to enable them to get subsidy as it were, and then buy food products.</p> <p>Now this subsidy program in this manner is unlikely to work. It is going to work for bookkeeping purposes for the government, in that the budget will say, \u201cYes, we have provided so much subsidy.\u201d One could argue that it might work, I guess, I can guarantee you it won\u2019t the way it\u2019s being designed, because look at it.</p> <p>There are obvious issues. Firstly, to open a bank account is so dramatic for the poor. They are illiterate people. You\u2019re not talking about a few 100. You\u2019re talking about a few millions of people, tens of millions of people who are illiterate, or are unable to fend for themselves, either because they\u2019re handicapped or don\u2019t have support, because they don\u2019t understand the language.</p> <p>You have 21 languages, and how do you reach out to all of the communities even using the same language. It\u2019s very difficult to reach out, and get them to fill out these monumental forms. These \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d requirements have become such holy cows.</p> <p>Do you think those poor people have time to fill out the forms, or have the ability to fill out the forms to open a bank account? Then it\u2019s been said, we know it. That\u2019s why you find. For instance, they don\u2019t invest in financial instruments as much as you would like.</p> <p>They\u2019re going to gold because it\u2019s so easy to buy. You don\u2019t have to show your identity. Even if they open a bank account, then how do you insure that the subsidy reaches out to the poor, for whom it is targeted?</p> <p>For instance, in a family of four, let\u2019s say, or six, where the husband may go to collect the money, and drink it before he reaches home. How do you make sure that there are three brothers don\u2019t fight among themselves, and say, \u201cLook. You\u2019ve taken away more of my share,\u201d because it\u2019s not as if each individual existing in India will get the subsidy credits to that individual\u2019s account.</p> <p>It will go to the head of a family, or to the heads of the family, or whatever. It\u2019s going to be, unfortunately, a deduction in welfare at the end of the day if they implement this subsidy program to these cash transfers. That would work in a small economy, where you can accurately identify or give an identity card to an individual here with unique identity.</p> <p>The number doesn\u2019t give an identity card, as it were. It confirms that you exist, but not give you a, \u201cOK. Here, you didn\u2019t have a passport. You didn\u2019t have any of documents to prove that you exist, but you\u2019re obviously living. Here is your identity card.\u201d It doesn\u2019t do that.</p> <p>Yeah. I\u2019m going to add. I found that as somebody who speaks, English in India, I was as able to communicate out in the countryside as colleagues of mine who were native Indians, and spoke two or three languages just by speaking slowly in English.</p> <p>The 21 languages issue would seem to be massive, and underappreciated, but as well, it may seem like it\u2019s not, necessarily, an investment consideration at first blush. If we consider India, and consider the growing middle-class argument, and consider the notion that as these people rise from unbelievable poverty they\u2019ll become consumers.</p> <p>It would seem like the impediments like these are critical considerations. Do you think that there is a credible plan in place to address all of these things or do you think that it seems to be, basically, working itself out?</p> <p>I think the concepts are good. The concept of, for instance, rural employment guarantees, the concept of a unique identity card, very good concept!</p> <p>But in a country with 1.25 billion people, with such a high illiteracy such that connectivity, whether by good, or by electronic, or communication devices. How can you ensure justice to each and every person? It\u2019s not going to be possible.</p> <p>You won\u2019t be fair to everyone. This program cannot work in the manner that design would take. If it was Singapore with five million people, of course it will work very well, but not with 1.25 billion people and this much illiteracy. Even today, adult illiteracy would be about 26 percent of the population.</p> <p>CFA Institute: If you think about the mental space that India occupied in the business landscape for a long time, it\u2019s easy to consWhere it was a very compelling place to do business process outsourcing because of a cost advantage, and that cost advantage drove economic competitiveness. Do you think that perception is still operative?</p> <p>India exists on so many planes.</p> <p>At one level, we have rocket science. We\u2019ve just sent a rocket to Mars. We speak of our aspirations, our ambitions, and our capability. We have that kind of large population. 30 percent of our population is urban, and of that urban population at least 50 percent of it, which is still a very large number, would be considered excellent in education, skill levels, et cetera.</p> <p>They compete with anyone in the world on almost all matters. For them the world is flat, as flat as it can be!</p> <p>Mr. Freidman\u00a0comes, and interacts with them. Naturally he thinks this is the way India is going, but there is a large number that is still in the stone age phase, for instance.</p> <p>How do you address their needs? How do you take care of their aspirations? How do you take care of that requirement? Forget want, but just needs and requirements.</p>","tags":["economic geography","interviews","india"]},{"location":"blog/2013/12/06/how-doing-what-is-right-helped-build-the-indian-financial-system/","title":"How Doing What Is Right Helped Build the Indian Financial System","text":"<p>This section will trace the construction of CRISIL, an institution central to India's economic development.</p> <p>The second part of this interview resonated unusually deeply with me, as I hope it will with you. It is a tangible example of how innovation in finance can make life better despite every complexity.</p> <p>Let\u2019s talk a little about CRISIL, because first of all, I have to say, you must be very proud to have\u00a0a book\u00a0written about a thing that you built with the subtitle, \u201cDoing What is Right.\u201d I would guess that that\u2019s something of a point of pride.</p> <p>Yes, indeed. I suggested the idea at first in 1986. In 1981, I came back from Harvard, and then I realized that there was a need for something like this.</p> <p>My then Chairman, who I helped set up another retail housing finance company, which was also the first retail housing finance company in the country, and which is a household name, Housing Development Finance Corporation.</p> <p>I was working there, and my Chairman wouldn\u2019t let me go. It took me about a year-and-a-half to get his permission. I was given leave of absence, just as I was given leave of absence from ICICI to start HDFC. I was then given leave of absence from HDFC to start CRISIL, and I was supposed to go back to my parent organization.</p> <p>At that time, interest rates were not differentiated under risk. They were administered. It was like a binary, if somebody was found creditworthy, they got money at a particular rate, and there was no differentiation amongst different borrowers, and their capability to pay back.</p> <p>A lot of people were not given any money at all, because they were just seen to be black, as we call it, not white or whatever. They were not good. A white was good. There were no shades of gray in between, we realized that they would need to start differentiating on the base of credit risk. There was a need to educate the regulators to free up the administrative mechanism.</p> <p>People didn\u2019t understand the concept of yield to maturity. Would you believe that, in bonds? Forget yield to call, yield to put, because those call and put bells and whistles didn\u2019t really come out in debentures, but they just took the funds at the rate, because it enabled administered interest rates so there was not seen to be volatility in the interest rate environment.</p> <p>We had to educate not only the regulators, but issuers of debt, investors in debt. A large number of people, and again, don\u2019t forget we have illiterate people who still have savings.</p> <p>Of course.</p> <p>We have low-educated people who still have savings who want some guidance. We have, of course, the sophisticated intermediaries, and investors. They all needed guidance, and our thought was to create awareness of the concept of credit rating amongst a diverse set of people, and four basic constituents, issuers, investors, intermediaries, and regulators, and address different needs.</p> <p>One of the most heartening things that I found, we developed a strategy. We had very small capital. We started with 14 million of capital at today\u2019s rate of exchange it would be about $700,000 of capital, and we had to survive\u2026it was a commercial venture! We had no ability to educate through advertising and promotion. I would take every opportunity to address gatherings.</p> <p>I must have addressed several 100 gatherings in the first two years of the chamber of commerce or institute of chartered accountants, or gathering of business people or whatever, Rotary Clubs, whichever, because it was a new concept. We took the opportunity to be interviewed in the press, because it was a new concept.</p> <p>Something clicked in the press, and we articulated it well. It got the attention of people, and we took advantage of that to create awareness, and spread the concept widely.</p> <p>Our strategy was to get strong companies, which were perceived to be strong companies, to begin using the ratings. We figured that they would start spreading the word, that they were the highest of high quality and so on. That was exactly what we did.</p> <p>We got high companies, or high quality companies come in the first three months. We started spreading the word by advertising. At least we got a flood of inquiries, \u201cWhat does this mean? How does it work? We also think we are very strong, why don\u2019t we get the same rating?\u201d And so on.</p> <p>We developed a methodology, which was different from Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s in one or two key respects. The one key respect that essentially was required, was that we decided that we would not work only for investors. We would work for issuers, as well as investors. As well as I told you, the regulator and intermediaries.</p> <p>Our philosophy was not one against the other; our philosophy was to help make the market function better, as you put it. What we said was that, if a company comes to us, an issuer of debt comes to us, wants a rating, and then doesn\u2019t like the rating\u2026.They will be free not to use it, we won\u2019t spread the word. We would bury that rating quietly.</p> <p>In that case, we would give them our analytical feedback, as to what the rating was, and why it was so. For instance, if the operating leverage was too low, the financial leverage was too high, or they didn\u2019t have succession plans, or the poor governance was contrary to what we thought it would be.</p> <p>For instance, just as an example, there was a company which was selling trucks. Then an associate company which was in the business financing, trucks which these guys made. The board of that associate company was controlled essentially by the truck manufacturer.</p> <p>We immediately found out that, there was a lack of proper governance. That the board was naturally biased towards supporting this truck manufacturer, as a sales tool for the parent, rather than operating for the good of the shareholders of the finance company.</p> <p>There were conflicts: In some cases, prudence would indicate not financing somebody for whatever reason. This would mean depriving their parent, or affiliate company, (the truck manufacturer) of business. So be it.</p> <p>We pointed out these kinds of things, and people loved it. No one had talked to them as frankly, as honestly. Never used to, even the biggest of industries. They were used to getting their way with the banks and institutions, and we stood up to them.</p> <p>We said, \u201cNo you are not triple AAA, or you are not single A.\u201d We also gave junk ratings to some. We never did it in a way that would give them the message that, you are doing a disgusting job. We said, oh, look this is what it comes out, you come out as junk. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not right to go into the market in this region, because you won\u2019t get money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou would unnecessarily, tell everyone that you are not credit worthy. Maybe, it\u2019ll affect your banking title. Why don\u2019t you do things? Why don\u2019t you raise capital or bring equity? You use this leverage. Shed off this dividend, and create liquidity for yourself.\u201d Et cetera, et cetera.</p> <p>We give them ideas like consultants, and that worked very, very well. We used to get postcards. Postcards from individuals, from Himachal, or Orissa or something saying, \u201cWhat is the credit rating rate? I\u2019m putting my fixed deposit here. Can you tell us?\u201d</p> <p>In different languages, and I put some sampling of this in a photograph form in one of my annual reports. Just to tell the world how pleased we were. That we were actually helping out the poor. You are helping out innocent people, who have no ability to make judgments, and here they were responding like this.</p> <p>Postcards, postcard is the cheapest way of communicating. In those days it used to be five paisa at one time, and five paisa is what a fraction of cent. One cent is 80 paisa. It\u2019s a fraction of a cent, and then it begins 15 paisa.</p> <p>They couldn\u2019t afford anything better. They would write in their own language, Oriya, or Punjabi, or whatever and say, \u201cCan you please tell us the rating and we would\u2026\u201d We were reaching out through the strategy of asking come, or not asking, or encouraging them. Not even encouraging. Giving a reason for companies to tell the world of their ratings.</p> <p>Even when companies was rated not in the highest, we told them that, \u201cLook, but don\u2019t forget. You can tell the world that you are better than your competitors. Your competitors don\u2019t even have a rating. How would they know what your competitor rating is?\u201d Put pressure on your competitors by even announcing your Single A rating, for instance.</p> <p>Different arguments that suited them, but it was always designed as a win-win situation, never working for one and against the other. That was a very fundamental characteristic of us. And we, of course didn\u2019t make any major mistakes.</p> <p>Our fee structure was such. We divided it in such a way that it was progressive. That we built it on the size of the issuer, that it became relatively affordable for even the smallest company, to come in and seek a rating. The fee for annual maintenance would also be affordable.</p> <p>Additionally, we were quite brutal about downgrading or not agreeing to their viewpoint if the rating merited so. If the circumstances were poor.</p> <p>As well, our team was young, we got excellent people from the Indian Institute of Management.</p> <p>At Calcutta we were the number one choice for the youngsters there. Indian Institute of Bangalore, we were the number one choice. In Indian Institute of Management we were not number one, but I managed to get a lot of people from Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, who had worked elsewhere as well.</p> <p>For instance, Roopa Kudva, who is now the CEO. She came to see me in 1992. As she recounted to me, when she was appointed to managing director or CEO of the company. One day she called me up that evening, and I hadn\u2019t talked to her for some time.</p> <p>I was very surprised that, \u201cOh! Wonderful to hear from you.\u201d She said, \u201cLook, I just came out from the board meeting. I have been appointed the managing director. I wanted to also tell you that, and you won\u2019t remember this, that in 1992 when I came to see you, I didn\u2019t have an appointment. You not only saw me, you gave me a job.\u201d That was the way we operated.</p> <p>If we saw a good person, we wouldn\u2019t let that person go out of the door. Take the job back here. The people had tremendous freedom. In our rating committee meetings, everyone was equal.</p> <p>We had a wide rating committee. Full of brilliant people, but anyone could chip in and argue with the committee or with any performance rating team. \u201cLook, you are wrong. You are giving too high rating, or too low rating or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>There would be free discussions. This I saw from my own work experience in that time, that if you allow youngsters, who of course have the capability within them. But, give them the freedom to express themselves without fear without favor, without any bias and anger. They would want to present their best foot forward. They would have to defend themselves in front of peers.</p> <p>That competitive spirit, without malice, was important. There would be no malice. There was no personal agenda, no angers for anyone. In a peer group, defending a rating or arguing for ones viewpoint, made for superb judgment, and superb outcomes in our rating decision. I was very happy in such a culture of honesty and integrity.</p> <p>That sort of has prevailed. \u201cDo what is right\u201d is what the book says. That was a sort of philosophy in which CRISIL operated. It continued, and CRISIL was very highly thought of everywhere.</p> <p>That\u2019s very cool, and in many ways is quite aligned with the way we think at CFA Institute. We obviously exist to\u00a0help global markets function better, with the ultimate hope that we would have some of the same outcomes.</p> <p>I want to ask: It seems like it\u2019s all well and good to go and define a culture of honesty, and say that you are going to seek and aspire to certain values. How do you really implement something like that?</p> <p>Our attempt was to get good people, good, competent, and honest to the best of our ability. We make quick judgments. Don\u2019t forget we didn\u2019t have the luxury and liberty of elaborate interviews and so on. We were growing so fast at one stage, not only that, we would lose people, because unfortunately we were not not the best paymasters at that time.</p> <p>We first we got a person that we could get, then we focused on systems, processes, and culture. This was our philosophy. That the process, the methodology for rating for instance, had to be comprehensive. There were no cutting corners whatsoever.</p> <p>If they were a company with 17 plants, we may not visit maybe more than two or three plants, but it was important to understand the culture in the organization. Whether they were cost-conscious, whether they looked over manned. Whether they lived clean, kept a focus on safety and so on.</p> <p>Although, assessments were being made by visits of a sample nature, Ratings were never given without meeting with the CEO and understanding the management philosophy. It was critical to understand the goals and ideals and their willingness to pay debt on time. With regard to ability, we could make judgment from past history, and product history and quality and so on so forth.</p> <p>Making judgment of willingness, was also very, very important for us. That\u2019s why we always had these management meetings. In some large companies, you would have meetings with as many as 50 people in an organization.</p> <p>Different heads of department, from HR people, from marketing to production, to, of course the finance and so on. It was a very comprehensive rating methodology, and it had served CRISIL in good sense and continued methodology. The rating has stood the test of time.</p> <p>It is now a 26 year old company, and it is doing very well. When I left it, it was the largest rating agency east of the Atlantic. A concept which was not started by us. It was learned from America, we adapted it. We were invited to give know-how to Israel.</p> <p>Israel had all the opportunity and the offers from the US rating agency, to help them in every detail. They didn\u2019t go anywhere with all the help. They came to us, and we gave them the know-how and they were so pleased. They planted a garden of 100 trees in my name.</p> <p>I remain friends even now with the founder, who is now a retired person, but still is a professor of residence in Tel Aviv University. We gave know-how to Malaysia. Again, the rating agency there was started, but it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. We helped them get going, and it has been a very, very successful operation we are told.</p> <p>There\u2019s an anecdote in the book that I find striking. It\u2019s given in the book as being potentially a myth. I guess it just seemed like it characterized these rating meetings appropriately. There\u2019s this senior CRISIL person, who is walking somebody from S&amp;P around the floor of the offices, to sort of show them what the company is capable of. The great capabilities of CRISIL.</p> <p>They walk by a conference room, and there is a senior guy, just laying into a junior guy with the uttermost vehemence. It looked, to this guy, like there was an emergency. He actually goes, \u201cOh! I didn\u2019t realize you had something urgent to attend to. We can continue doing this later.\u201d Then the guy who is showing him around goes, \u201cOh, no, no, no. This is routine. It happens all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Then the junior guy that he was laying into, starts giving it right back to him. That seems so remarkable.</p> <p>It is symbolic of the culture. As I said, our rating committees were a treat. There was a design in that rating committee process. It was multi-layer.</p> <p>For instance, if we knew the rating would be originating in the branch. In that branch, the team would have to present their findings to an internal committee there, and it would help even our judgment. No bullying, no pressure.</p> <p>The team\u2019s decision would of course be final, but surely they would have learned something from peers and so on. They would give contributions, because they were required to, and obligated to, and of course competent enough to do so.</p> <p>Then we would come to our rating committee, and in the rating committee, we would have a full house. Whoever was present, was not only invited, whoever was professional was not only invited to, but obligated to attend.</p> <p>It was like a small town hall meeting, in a boardroom. We would have about 30, 40 people sometimes, crowded and sitting in on the rating. No secrecy, no conspiracy, but fairly learning from each other as it were.</p> <p>A presentation on a shipping company for instance, and the rating of the shipping company would be critiqued by someone who may not have been associated with shipping, but that person learned something.</p> <p>Then would certainly have something to say, perhaps on the financial matters and the cash flow and so on, and they might comment on that, or might not comment, but just sit in and listen.</p> <p>Putting the rating presentation in front of peers, as well as their seniors in the rating committee itself, made people put their best foot forward.</p> <p>There was complete freedom, not only freedom, but it was encouragement and obligatory. If somebody knew something better than whoever is speaking, he or she was not only allowed, but encouraged to speak their mind.</p> <p>As I said, always in the interest of the subject on end, never personal, no malicious intent, no vested interest. Those were not there. To my mind, that was one of the secrets of our rating outcomes, and secret of the culture that was created. Absolutely transparent, free, frank, no manipulation.</p> <p>When we started this rating business, we were seeking desperately, association in national organization, and so on. We started with Standard and Poor\u2019s, and they would not allow me beyond their reception.</p> <p>Moody came and surveyed the market at our institute at ICICI. They said to us finally that, \u201cLook, rating is an art and a science. You don\u2019t have the art, you don\u2019t have the science. Sorry, we can\u2019t help you. If you want to do credit rating like Dunn &amp; Bradstreet does, we would be happy to help you out.\u201d</p> <p>We said, \u201cSorry, we are looking for capital market ratings.\u201d We had IFC Washington, the International Finance Corporation, which was really the great private sector supporter of India, through its foreign know-how, and money and so on so forth.</p> <p>They wrote in a letter, that they did not have confidence, they would not participate because number one, Indian industrialists would browbeat this company, and get the ratings of their choice, and it would lose its credibility. Second, we just didn\u2019t have the know-how.</p> <p>We had to prove them wrong. I was 34, when I was asked to take up the rating agency. I took it as a personal challenge I said. My great chairman\u00a0Mr. Vaghul\u00a0who backed it. He was the chairman of ICICI.</p> <p>He said, \u201cAll right, you know if you are ready to go, then go.\u201d [laughs] Because, I told him, I said \u201cSir, why do we go with the second best? With someone who doesn\u2019t understand, we would go on our own and do it.\u201d He said, \u201cAll right.\u201d He put his weight behind it. His name was on the line. I was a young chap, if I stumbled people they would have said, \u201cOK. What do you expect of this guy?\u201d</p> <p>He had the vision and the courage to back me, and I think it worked very well.</p> <p>Wonderful Pradip.

It was first published on CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor. </p> <p>If you peruse the Wikipedia entries that describe some of the world\u2019s great investors, you\u2019ll often find that they share a common footnote: a series of books entitled \u201cThe Market Wizards\u201d which feature\u00a0Jack Schwager\u2019s\u00a0profiles of a number of successful traders.</p> <p>His most recent book,\u00a0The Little Book of Market Wizards\u00a0is a distillation of those interviews into a collection of lessons that can provide a useful entry point for those who might not be familiar with the habits, thought patterns, and disciplines that can differentiate great traders from good ones.</p> <p>Jack and I spoke recently about his most recent book, the characteristics of great traders, and the path that those who should aspire to be great should follow. A condensed and edited transcript follows, beneath the full conversation.</p> <p>CFA Institute:\u00a0What does the word \u201ctrader\u201d mean?</p> <p>Jack Schwager:\u00a0To me, trader means, first of all, someone who is as likely to go short, as well as long. It takes away this automatic long bias. That\u2019s one critical element to the word, \u201ctrader.\u201d</p> <p>Another element of it is, I think, a willingness to change position with maybe more frequency than someone you might term as a \u201clong term investor.\u201d Those are the key elements.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s odd, when I remember for \u201cMarket Wizards,\u201d the first of the Market Wizard books, when I interviewed\u00a0Jim Rogers, immediately as soon as I stepped into his Brownstone he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you want to interview me, I\u2019m not a trader.\u201d</p> <p>That was his opening line. I said, \u201cWell, yeah. I know you invest long term but, in my mind, you are a trader because you will go short as well as long, and change positions, and so forth.\u201d</p> <p>In my mind you are making decisions. To me, decision on when to go in, out, reverse positions, that\u2019s a trader. As opposed to a long term investor who says, \u201cI want to have 50 percent of my money in equities. I\u2019m going to buy an index. I\u2019m going to stay for 40 years.\u201d</p> <p>Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that but that\u2019s not a trader.</p> <p>How do great traders go about finding their approach to the markets? What would you say sets them apart?</p> <p>Novices tend to believe there\u2019s some answer out there, that it\u2019s a matter of finding the right formula, the single right technique. That\u2019s why books like, \u201cHow I made a million dollars trading in the markets,\u201d always sell well.</p> <p>The truth is it doesn\u2019t work that way. There is no single way that works continuously. If it did, it would stop working anyway because everyone would follow it.</p> <p>It\u2019s a really a matter of finding a method that is right for the person. It varies all over the place because there are people like, going back to Rogers, people like Rogers who have complete disdain for technical analysis. He\u2019d say that the only people he\u2019s met that make money in technical analysis is those that sell their technical analysis services, that\u2019s his take on it.</p> <p>On the other hand, you\u2019ve got people like\u00a0Martin Schwartz\u00a0who\u2019ve done phenomenally well. He\u2019d say: \u201cI spent a decade as a fundamental analyst, but I got rich as a technician.\u201d</p> <p>Believe me, Rogers could never make money using technical analysis and Schwartz could not make money using fundamental analysis. Yet, they both do terrifically well.</p> <p>The very first thing to get across to people is you\u2019ve got to figure out what is the right method. It\u2019s not just fundamental versus technical. Either are you short-term, or you\u2019re long-term. Do you want to trade stocks? Do you want to trade futures? Do you want to trade currencies? On and on with the variations.</p> <p>It\u2019s a discovery process, an evolutionary process. Nobody can tell you that.</p> <p>I get emails from people sometimes. They\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat trading method would you recommend?\u201d To me, the question is a lot like \u201cI\u2019m going to buy an expensive suit. What size should I get?\u201d</p> <p>How would I know? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re six-six or five-five, so you can\u2019t answer that question. There is no answer to that question. There is no right sized suit for everybody, and people need to think of trading the same way. There is no right size trading method for everybody.</p> <p>Is it enough to \u201cfind the right suit size\u201d so to speak?</p> <p>The approach has to have an edge. It\u2019s not enough to just have an approach that you\u2019re comfortable with. It can make all the sense in the world. On paper, it might sound reasonable, but the markets don\u2019t pay off for approaches that sound reasonable. They pay off for what works, and what works may often be very counter-intuitive.</p> <p>You have to get some sense of feeling and confidence that that approach that you\u2019ve evolved works. By work, I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s a money machine. I just mean that over time it\u2019s making more than it\u2019s losing. That\u2019s the edge.</p> <p>What about managing risk?</p> <p>That\u2019s very important, but first I\u2019ll note that these are not in order of importance, they\u2019re in chronological order. You develop a method that\u2019s right for your personality. It has to have an edge. Then, when you\u2019re implementing it, part of the planning process has to be risk management.</p> <p>You can have a method that has an edge, but if you don\u2019t take risk management into account very seriously, and your approach leaves you open to having single trades, or a small number of trades, lose a lot of money.</p> <p>A good approach could be sabotaged by a few mistakes. You never want that. You never want to be at the mercy of having a few mistakes knock you out of the game. Virtually every trader I ever interviewed said the risk management part is more important than the method.</p> <p>You\u2019ve got the key ingredients, but it all doesn\u2019t mean anything unless you implement it, and implement it consistently. Another way of saying that is \u201cdiscipline.\u201d You need the discipline to take your method, with the edge and the risk management, and stay true to it. There are trades that are going to look scary and that you\u2019re going to really not want to take, but if it\u2019s part of your methodology, you take them.</p> <p>There are times your methodology, or your risk management, tells you, \u201cHere\u2019s where you\u2019re out.\u201d You may hate to get out, but that\u2019s your methodology, that\u2019s your risk management, you get out. You have to be strict on the discipline part.</p> <p>So self-knowledge, having an edge, risk management, and discipline are the qualities that set these traders apart?</p> <p>Flexibility is another trait that separates great traders from just about everybody else. They\u2019re able to change on a dime. They could be wildly bullish one minute, and if something happens to change their mind, they\u2019re able to be wildly bearish the next. That flexibility to be able to change your mind and not hope that your position is right is an essential ingredient.</p> <p>That\u2019s true of a number of traders.\u00a0Paul Tudor Jones\u00a0was bullish on the stock market when I saw him one week. Two weeks later, he was bearish.</p> <p>Apart from the characteristics we\u2019ve discussed, is there some other quality that all of these great traders have . . . Is there a look or something? Did all the successful traders go to Harvard Business School, for example?</p> <p>No, of course not, some of them went to Princeton.</p> <p>No, it\u2019s become more a characteristic of the modern hedge fund world. and loses its way people getting jobs within hedge funds. The people from the Ivy League schools have the better shot and so forth. You get maybe an over representation of that.</p> <p>Certainly, there are a lot of hedge fund managers that go to Ivy League schools, but as far as the people I\u2019ve interviewed they fall all over the map. Some dropped out of college in fact. It\u2019s not necessarily just people that are book smart.</p> <p>There\u2019s a different type of intelligence that goes with trading. In some cases, it depends on methodology. If it\u2019s a high quant methodology then sure, having a PHD from Princeton in mathematics is probably beneficial. Some guys are just several deviations off the IQ scale, no question super brilliant people.</p> <p>But you have other traders who are not amount of book smarts, and maybe not using that type of analysis at all or any real quant stuff. They\u2019ve just got a good feel for markets, and have a way of taking lots and lots of different facts, and distilling down what\u2019s important.</p> <p>A good representation of that might be someone like\u00a0Mike Marcus. He\u2019s no dummy. His Masters is in psychology, but he wasn\u2019t a quant guy.</p> <p>I remember, this was a story that I heard not from Marcus, I don\u2019t know if it was Marcus that told me, but it may have been other traders in\u00a0Commodities Corp\u00a0that told me the story.</p> <p>Helmut Weymar, the founder of the company, wrote a book on analyzing the cocoa market. Marcus\u2019s comment about the book was that it, \u201cwas so complicated I couldn\u2019t understand the cover.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a personal story here, which applies. I met Marcus, because when I was getting my first job as a Wall Street analyst the job I was taking, he was voluntarily vacating, because he was going to become a \u201cTrader.\u201d</p> <p>He was leaving this analyst position to become a trader, and I met him when I was coming in. We talked a little bit, and he was still in New York for a few years before he went out to Malibu, and we used to get together for lunch.</p> <p>I remember this instance where I was an analyst. At that time, I was really a fundamental analyst, and I would cover a number of markets, one of which was cotton.</p> <p>As a good little economic graduate, I did all the basic analysis. I went back. I studied the economics of every market in the post-World War II period, and decided that there were only three or four markets at that time that would qualify as free markets.</p> <p>In all the other years, the government program kicked in and distorted the price, so you really couldn\u2019t tell what the true recoil of your price would have been. I was left with just those three or four years, and then based on that analysis, really there wasn\u2019t enough data to form an opinion.</p> <p>That\u2019s what I should have said, but I came up with the conclusion that that season was the most bullish, as bullish as the most bullish free market season we had. Prices were about 25 cents at the time, and the highest we\u2019d ever had was somewhere in the mid-30s or whatever.</p> <p>That was my projection, which was good as far as it went. I also believe that, once we got up to the mid-30s, it\u2019s getting pretty high and the market\u2019s fully priced. Here\u2019s where the difference between someone like myself, who is doing things analytically, and Marcus comes in.</p> <p>Marcus, and I were having lunch, and I was starting to short cotton. It was getting to that point where i felt it was fully priced.</p> <p>Marcus says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s going much higher.\u201d The reason he thought so was because it was the first year that China, which was then called the PRC, was a buyer of cotton. There are a thousand facts out there about cotton, but he understood that this one fact, that the PRC was the buyer for the first time, changed everything.</p> <p>He was absolutely right. Cotton didn\u2019t stop at the mid-30s, mid-40s, mid-50s. It went all the way up to 99 cents, which was the highest price cotton had ever seen since the Civil War. He got it right, and he made a fortune on that market, even though I did a lot more analysis and more work, because he understood the one fact that mattered.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to be a D.E. Shaw or an Ed Thorpe to make money in the markets. It\u2019s a different approach. His approach was one that worked for him, and he had that type of market intelligence that is not so much book smarts. It\u2019s an intuitive smarts.</p> <p>What advice would you give to non-professionals who would like to start trading?</p> <p>The process is first, read.</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell you what to read. Just go explore, whether it\u2019s on the web or go to a library, go to a bookstore if you can still find one these days.</p> <p>That\u2019s a challenge in itself. However you do it, just pick up different things. Look at different things. See what they\u2019re saying. You\u2019ll find what you gravitate. Once you figure out where you\u2019re gravitating to, read more on that.</p> <p>Then start thinking about, on your own, start thinking about ideas based upon what you read. Start looking about how you might implement it in the market.</p> <p>Watch the market. Take those ideas. Try different things.</p> <p>Then eventually, we\u2019ll try to evolve that into some sort of methodology that you could define rules with, come up with a risk management plan. Once you have that in place, paper trade. Paper trading\u2019s not the same because you don\u2019t have the emotional thing component, but it\u2019s a way of checking whether you really have an edge.</p> <p>If it seems like you do have an edge, then start with a small amount of money and implement it. That\u2019ll make it real, and I say a small amount of money because most people will lose when they start trading.</p> <p>You might as well get the education cheaper. No reason to do a $50,000 degree when you can get one for $5,000, so to speak.</p> <p>Then of course, if you\u2019re trading with real money successfully, then gradually increase it as you feel comfortable. That\u2019s basically the line of progress that I would recommend.</p> <p>If you liked this conversation, you should definitely subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["manager selection","interviews","hedge funds"]},{"location":"blog/2014/05/11/economics-syllabus/","title":"Economics Syllabus","text":"<p>Ms. Bushman</p> <p>Room 372</p> <p>Social Studies Department,</p> <p>Jennifer Suri, Assistant Principal</p> <p>Stuyvesant High School</p> <p>New York, NY</p> <p>ECONOMICS</p> <p>Texts and Materials: \u00a0</p> <p>Antell, Gerson, Walter Harris.\u00a0\u00a0Economics: Institutions and Analysis.\u00a0\u00a0New York:\u00a0\u00a0Amsco School Publications.</p> <p>Krugman, Paul, Robin Wells.\u00a0\u00a0Economics.\u00a0 New York: Worth Publishers, 2009.</p> <p>Mankiw, N.

understand the CPI, and discuss the difference between Cost-Push and Demand-Pull inflation.\u00a0 (Pgs. 349-352.)\u00a0 And we will discuss the effects of inflation on interest rates\u00a0 (real vs. nominal interest rates--Pgs. 353-354.)\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Consider two different people you know with different financial profiles.\u00a0\u00a0 Describe how inflation would affect them.\u00a0\u00a0Write this down.\u00a0\u00a0Take a\u00a0look at this site\u00a0which compares the CD (certificate of deposit) rates from a number of financial institutions.\u00a0 Graph a \"yield

<p>Homework #9--Balance Sheets and Banks--Monday, March 22</p> <p>We will begin our discussion of Banks--their role in the Economy, their strengths and weaknesses, and the way in which the Federal Reserve Bank eases credit by increasing the money supply, (those \"M's\" we discussed awhile ago.)</p> <p>To understand any of the effects which the Federal Reserve has on Money Supply, youmust read \"The Business of Banking,\" Pgs 363-370.</p> <p>On Pg. 379, do the Skills section, where you must \"explain\" all the entries on a bank's balance sheet and account for a change in the bank's financial position.\u00a0\u00a0Write this down.</p> <p>Also, please scan Pgs. 358-363 and 370-374.\u00a0 Bring any questions you have on it to class.\u00a0 This is material for which you are responsible but which we will only cover\u00a0 tangentially.</p> <p>Homework #10--The Federal Reserve--Tuesday, March 23</p> <p>The Federal Reserve, pure and simply, is the most powerful monetary player in our Economy.\u00a0 There is lots of good stuff to read about them and I urge you to play around, now or later.\u00a0</p> <p>BUT it is essential that you read the VERY BRIEF section on the Fed's three tools for monetary policy.\u00a0 (Pgs. 389-393.)\u00a0 Don't mess around on this.\u00a0 It is really important and I will test you to death on it.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Also, in your own words, write down a description of\u00a0 each of the three tools of Monetary Policy--Open Market Operations, Reserve Ratio and Discount Rate.\u00a0 How often do you think the Fed uses each of them?\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Also look at the\u00a0Federal Reserve website\u00a0which is ever so much better than your book.\u00a0</p> <p>I like the website of the\u00a0Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0, though all the regional Feds have their own sites.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>To see what the real guys really look at, scan the \"Beige Book\"\u00a0 entry about the New York region, compiled by the Fed to inform the Federal Open Market Committee what is really going on in local economies.</p> <p>This site--Fed 101--is a little \"Mickey Mouse\" but it's sort of fun.</p> <p>Homework #11--More on the Fed--Wednesday, March 24</p> <p>Read Pgs. 381-389 about why we have the Fed in the first place.</p> <p>Review the \"Equation of Exchange\" on Page 390.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>You and several of your classmates will be assigned a segment of the Fed's history for presentation on Thursday.\u00a0 The timeline will be divided into segments based on the periods suggested by\u00a0this Fed website.\u00a0You can take this a step further and research your segment more fully if you so desire.\u00a0 Several lucky customers will be designated as leaders for this discussion in my absence.\u00a0 My substitute will collect a brief paragraph regarding the assignment from each group of students presenting.</p> <p>Homework #12--Study for Exam--Thursday, March 25</p> <p>Tomorrow's

vacation.\u00a0 Note that it is actually more than a week.\u00a0 Make sure you sleep and eat--the two most important things for success in life.</p> <p>Please see new tab entitled Monetary/Fiscal Policy for ongoing homework assignments.</p> <p>This is the \"meatiest\" section of the course.\u00a0 When the economy was in such rough shape a year or so ago, the Fed \"eased\" monetary policy dramatically, throwing trillions of dollars into the banking system to help prevent the panic of market participants.\u00a0 Many of the programs the Fed put into place are closing down now, and the big issue facing the Fed is preventing inflation, which often occurs when there is too much money around.\u00a0 (It's called Demand-Pull Inflation-\"too much money chasing too few goods.\")\u00a0 At the same time that the Fed was doing its thing, the government also passed a $789 billion stimulus package, increasing \"G,\" the government spending portion of GDP.\u00a0 (Remember: GDP=C+I+G+New Exports.\u00a0 Tattoo it on your forehead...)\u00a0 Both monetary, (what the Fed did), and fiscal, (what the government did), were incredibly stimulating to the economy.\u00a0 Together, they pulled the economy back from the brink of a disastrous depression akin to the Great Depression in the 1930's.</p> <p>Homework #1--Remembering how to spell F..E..D..--Wednesday, April 7</p> <p>Reread two

Similarly, as price rises, individual sellers are willing/able to supply more of a good or service.\u00a0</p> <p>Shifts in the supply curve come when a fundamental aspect of the supply side is changed. The primary reason a supply curve shifts is a change in input prices (i.e. the cost of chocolate chips rises). Other reasons are developments in technology, price of alternate goods (if I can make more money selling blondies, the amount of chocolate chip cookies I am willing/able to sell will decrease), and expectations. If sellers expect the price to increase, they may decrease the quantity currently supplied, so they may supply more in the future.</p> <p>Demand Curves: As price decreases, the number of consumers willing/able to buy a certain good or service increases.\u00a0</p> <p>Demand curves can also shift for several reasons. They can shift based on changes in consumer preference, population, and income. They can also shift based on expectations. If buyers expect prices to rise in the future, the demand for a certain good/service at this moment in time will increase.\u00a0</p> <p>The demand curve also shifts in relation to the price of complements and substitutes. For chocolate chip cookies, milk is a complement, meaning that the price of milk and cookies are correlated. As the price of milk rises, the demand for chocolate chip cookies goes down. Oreos are a substitute for chocolate chip cookies. As the price of Oreos rises, the demand for chocolate chip cookies also rises.</p> <p>Supply and Demand Together: When one puts the supply and demand curve together, one can find the quantites supplied and quantities demanded at any given price point. One can also see the equilibrium price, the price point at which qt supplied=qt demanded. If either or both of the curves shift, there will be a new equilibrium price.</p> <p>Price ceilings are when there is a mandated maximum price for a certain good/service. Typically, the price mandated for a ceiling is a price higher than the natural equilibrium price. When there is a price ceiling, there are surpluses, meaning that the qt supplied is greater than the qt demanded.</p> <p>Price floors are when there is a mandated minimum price for a certain good or service. These are graphed at a price lower than the natural equilibrium. When there are price floors, there are shortages of said good/service, because qt demanded exceeds qt supplied.</p> <p>Homework #1--Introduction to Supply and Demand--</p> <p>This is the most important topic which we will cover in this course.\u00a0 It is a foundation for all which will follow.\u00a0 Once you are conversant with this model you will see examples and ramifications in everything you touch.\u00a0 So prepare to have your brain bent.</p> <p>Read Intro Section in Krugman text:\u00a0\u00a0Module 5--Introduction to Supply and Demand (Webmaster's note: I don't have this PDF.

Well, investment media occasionally does a poor job reminding its readers that, as far as their wealth is concerned, the\u00a0most recent high-profile earnings announcement\u00a0is a passing distraction compared to their savings pattern.</p> <p>This post\u2019s title offers a simple way to think about it. Imagine that your personal life is a business. Are you profitable? If you\u2019re neglecting your loan balances and buying expensive things on credit, consider how you would react if one of the companies in your portfolio was doing the same thing. What about a company that managed to go a whole lifetime without ever generating a meaningful amount of cash?</p> <p>We Do This for a Reason</p> <p>We often rationalize economically destructive decisions by imagining we will clean up our messes in the future. Things will change. Our ship will come in.</p> <p>People who ignore their economic reality have been characterized as \u201ctemporarily embarrassed millionaires,\u201d and the descriptor fits quite well. After all, how easy is it to imagine that things will get better when one of many possible good things happen in the future? All too often, we deny economic reality thinking that a raise, inheritance, or investment gain will offset our bad decisions.</p> <p>This is pure\u00a0inertia. It is difficult enough to find motivation for fun things. What about avowedly less fun things, like not spending money? Since none of the other investment advice on this site (or any other) will be of much value until your finances are in control, what sort of steps can you take to bring yourself on a path towards personal profitability?</p> <p>You Need Big Discipline and Little Tricks</p> <p>This is a meaningful separation. No matter how clever the personal finance trick, there will always be a risk of financial implosion if your spending habits are not under control. If you manage to save up a meaningful emergency fund and then spend it all on a JetSki, it will be difficult to argue that you\u2019ve improved your lot in life financially. Developing the discipline not to raid your savings is the core skill that will determine your degree of financial success.</p> <p>With that said, it is possible to reduce the need for financial discipline in your day-to-day life by setting some things on autopilot. In a 2012\u00a0profile\u00a0of Barack Obama, the president\u2019s unique approach to limiting \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d came to light. He observes \u201cYou\u2019ll see I wear only gray or blue suits; I\u2019m trying to pare down decisions. I don\u2019t want to make decisions about what I\u2019m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.\u201d</p> <p>In that same vein, why would you put yourself in a place where you need to save money manually every single day? What if you could just set yourself on autopilot?</p> <p>While there are no \u201cset it and forget it\u201d strategies, here are three little tricks that I use to manage my own money that have made my life easier.</p> <ol> <li>Use multiple bank accounts and automatic payments to stay on budget. One of the easiest places to make a financial mistake is in your monthly remittances. It\u2019s obvious that if you forget to pay your bills you\u2019ll rack up late fees, but what about if you forget to save? I divide my paycheck up between separate accounts dedicated to bill payments, spending money, personal savings, and retirement savings. This makes it very difficult to deviate from the plan.</li> <li>Have some kind of central dashboard and check it regularly. Make sure you have a place where you can easily figure out if your finances are still under control. All of the automation in the world won\u2019t do much for you if you have no way of telling if it\u2019s getting you anywhere. Some rely on the help of a financial planner to figure this out or periodically evaluate their spending while balancing their checkbook.

Make sure that you structure your automatic payments so that you are getting the maximum return on your dollar. One of the best ways to do this is by directing extra money towards your high interest debt. Though it may initially seem daunting, it\u2019s actually pretty easy to figure out what to do here. Either use specialized services (like\u00a0tuition.io\u00a0for student loans) or just make a list of your loans and their interest rates. Pay the minimums on most of them, and pay down the highest interest one as fast as you can afford. When it\u2019s gone, move on to the next one.</li> </ol> <p>These three tips are just the beginning.

Watches have always seemed like a matter of personal preference rather than one of incontrovertible utility. After all, why would I want some clunky wrist thing? Now I\u2019m changing my mind.</p> <p>What sold me was the unstated implication at the end of\u00a0the Apple Watch\u2019s product video. Jony Ive, the senior vice president of design at Apple, observes that \u201cWe\u2019re now at a compelling beginning: actually designing technology to be worn, to be truly personal.\u201d</p> <p>This is a very big deal. The Apple\u00a0Watch is the first device that\u00a0lives on a user\u2019s body and\u00a0has the potential to deliver technological interactions without separating the wearer from their environment. Accordingly, it represents a bright line: technology is no longer something you necessarily stop interacting with the world to use. It\u2019s just something that exists.</p> <p>This post will not conduct the analysis you might expect. I will not discuss the addressable market for Apple\u00a0Watches, sales estimates, or share prices. I\u2019m more focused on what a wearable device with the potential for commercial success means for human-computer interaction than with any particular device. Accordingly, let\u2019s consider the only question that matters.</p> <p>What Is Actually Being Sold?</p> <p>This thing is not just a watch. But it\u2019s not the\u00a0physical product that I am excited about. I am excited because hardware companies are recognizing that I want to use technology\u00a0between\u00a0screens rather than on them.</p> <p>Consider a way that you might actually use the Apple\u00a0Watch. The intuitive thing to focus on is querying a service or retrieving email, but that is a use case that occurs only because it\u2019s the way we use technology now. What if it augmented our experience in another way, by giving us a new window to other people?</p> <p>One of the features I have not heard enough buzz about are the Snapchat-style sketches that we will be able to share at the flick of a wrist. These sketches \u2014 like notes passed in class or cave paintings \u2014\u00a0are the essence of communication. I can share drawings (which will wind up looking fundamentally like cave paintings) with others, and we can communicate using those sketches, just like we did thousands of years ago. We have developed immeasurably complex technology which will allow us to interact with our surroundings as intuitively as we did in the Stone Age.</p> <p>Much of the technology that we use in our daily lives is something that we consider separate from non-technological artifacts. As I write this on my iPhone in the subway, I am consciously using technology. I\u2019ve made a choice to engage with my surroundings only in order not to bump into anyone in the spirit of getting work done.</p> <p>But that can and will change. Apple\u00a0Watches are designed to exist with us, not to be awkwardly fondled. They are a piece of technology that lives with us in reality rather than transferring us into a virtual one. A charred twig used to make a cave painting didn\u2019t feel like technology to a caveman, and in the same way the descendant of an Apple\u00a0Watch\u00a0might not necessarily feel like technology to my grandchildren. After all, do you consider an analog watch to be technology?</p> <p>This is one significant evolution in a trend that my colleague\u00a0Jason Voss, CFA,\u00a0and I classify as the rise of human technology. It\u2019s a big trend with a lot of implications, but its ultimate implication is that tech\u00a0products will come to feel more like our limbic systems than something that we consciously interact with.</p> <p>This phone\u2019s features fulfill that trend in several key ways:</p> <ul> <li>It\u2019s a tech product that\u2019s differentiating itself with fashion.\u00a0If you look at the watch\u2019s\u00a0product page, you may notice something interesting: the different lines of the product stress fashion features, not technical ones. Have you ever seen a laptop marketed as a fashion accessory? I haven\u2019t even heard how fast the processor of the Apple Watch\u00a0is or how much RAM\u00a0it has.</li> <li>Human health is one of its killer apps.\u00a0The Apple Watch will gather the same data that a Fitbit or FuelBand does, but it will also offer other functionality. This means that one of the key ways we\u2019ll use these devices will be to improve our well-being. In a very real sense,\u00a0health will be one of its killer apps.</li> <li>Finally, human security is assured.\u00a0If you heard about\u00a0Apple Pay, you might naturally wonder how they intend to keep your data secure. After all, somebody might pick up and use your watch without you present and just spend your money. Ingeniously, this watch will use\u00a0contact with your skin\u00a0to verify your identity. Imagine a world where such an iterated version of a system like this replaces passwords as a means of verifying your identity. In that world, technology looks a lot more human.</li> </ul> <p>If Not This One, Then the Next</p> <p>Whether the Apple\u00a0Watch or a competing product ultimately delivers a more human interaction with technology, it seems clear that an important trend is being born: technology that doesn\u2019t separate you from your environment.</p> <p>Wearables have existed for a while (notably the\u00a0Pebble Smartwatch\u00a0and the\u00a0large collection offered by Samsung), but the debut of the Apple Watch suggests that wearable devices will gain a large audience among both consumers and software developers inside of the next two years.</p> <p>I might be being too enthusiastic, but I\u2019m biased here. As I said, I\u2019m excited to buy a watch.\u00a0Watch geeks are excited too, so I feel like my excitement is substantiated.\u00a0</p> <p>If you liked this essay, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["technology"]},{"location":"blog/2014/09/12/an-inside-view-of-the-scottish-secession-vote/","title":"An Inside View of the Scottish Secession Vote","text":"<p>Scotland decides on the 18th of September whether it\u00a0remains in the\u00a0United Kingdom, and the vote has far-reaching impact.\u00a0</p> <p>Curious about what the tenor on the ground is like and the potential impact it\u00a0has,\u00a0Jason Voss, CFA,\u00a0and I called\u00a0Colin Mclean, the CEO of\u00a0SVM Asset Management.</p> <p>His thoughts on the vote are as provocative as his comments on the\u00a0private equity industry, and I found our conversation illuminating.

If that roughly describes the amount you\u2019ve focused on financial history over the last 10 years, it\u2019s likely time for a quick refresher.</p> <p>In the introduction to our New York Financial Market History Roundtable, our head of curriculum development Bobby Lamy noted that portfolio managers from around the world have consistently told him that an understanding of financial market history and how it affects the investment process is key to doing\u00a0their jobs well.</p> <p>In other words, it\u2019s surprising that global interest in a topic that senior investment professionals around the world find valuable is dwindling. What should investors be paying attention to?</p> <p>That question permeated a nearly two hour discussion in which investment luminaries Richard Sylla, Marty Fridson, CFA, Tom Scherer, and Jack Malvey, CFA considered why investment managers find so much value in the study of market history, what can be learned from it, and how investment professionals might use history to make better decisions in the\u00a0Future of Finance.</p> <p>So what are you missing if \u2014 like many people \u2014 you\u2019ve been ignoring financial history?

Please share any observations you have in the comments field!</p> <p>Stocks Yielded More Than Bonds for Almost a Hundred Years</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0Robert Shiller.</p> <p>Panelist Marty Fridson, CFA, pointed out that one of the major changes in the last century came when \u2014\u00a0in 1959 \u2014\u00a0bonds started to yield more than stocks, a trend that continued\u00a0until recently.</p> <p>We File As Many Patents Each Year As We Used to Each Decade </p> <p>Source:\u00a0United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p> <p>When asked for a cause for optimism, panelist Jack Malvey, CFA, noted the accelerating pace of innovation and said that he generally believed it would increase at an exponential rate. As the chart above shows, the increase in the number of patents filed in the United States alone is astounding. Last year, Americans filed as many patents as they did in the 1940s.</p> <p>Tom Scherer focused on some of the reasoning Warren Buffett used in coming up with his 16 October 2008 op-ed entitled \u201cBuy American. I Am.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that Buffett likely would not have been quite so optimistic about the United States if it weren\u2019t in a relatively strong competitive position.</p> <p>As the readout from the\u00a0Global Competitiveness Report 2014\u20132015\u00a0issued by the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows, this is in fact the case. According to the WEF, the United States remains one of the most competitive countries on the planet, surpassed only by Switzerland and Singapore. In the chart below, the green countries are the most competitive and the red countries are the least. Countries without a color (like Greenland) weren\u2019t included in the study.</p> <p>This is particularly important in the context of Tom\u2019s next comment: \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t seen that, maybe he would\u2019ve had a different reaction.\u201d In other words, even though the 200-plus years of growth the United States has seen might impel a natural optimism, Buffett seems to have analyzed the situation before drawing a conclusion.</p> <p>This is one of the key lessons in using financial market history effectively: it is not a substitute for analysis or critical thinking, just an extra resource to draw upon.</p> <p>If you enjoyed this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["financial history","economic history","macro"]},{"location":"blog/2014/10/15/can-financial-advisers-make-their-clients-happy/","title":"Can Financial Advisers Make Their Clients Happy?","text":"<p>This was first published on CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Financial advisers work with their clients to understand their goals and needs, then suggest investments that make sense in that context, and thereafter consult with them periodically to make sure everything is on track to realize those aspirations.</p> <p>That simple feedback loop can be a powerful force. Even\u00a0professional investors who don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to beat the stock market will acknowledge\u00a0the value that comes from dealing with an adviser\u00a0and working towards well-defined goals and checking in over time.</p> <p>In that process, advisers gain a lot of highly personal information about their clients\u2019 innermost selves. In a world where the fees advisers can charge are shrinking and\u00a0the market for financial advice is arguably being disrupted, it would behoove financial advisers to extend their value proposition.</p> <p>As an observer, it seems that one way they might do that is by\u00a0taking on something of a\u00a0life-coaching role. Since advisers\u00a0must justify their value among a sea of algorithms and exchange-traded funds, they had better compete on something other than cost, accuracy, and speed. Empathy, intuition, and rapport are core strengths of financial advisers, and they should be building business plans that take those fully into account.</p> <p>What would the world look like if the financial adviser\u2019s job was also to focus\u00a0their clients on taking tangible steps towards becoming happier, better-adjusted people?</p> <p>Think Before You Laugh</p> <p>There is a market for the pursuit of happiness. The \u201cself-help\u201d industry\u00a0is estimated to generate $1 billion per year in the United States. At minimum, this is a sign of engagement with the concept of self-improvement.</p> <p>Annual spending on self-help is just one measure of how consumers interact with products and literature aimed at improving their lives. What if that same information could be delivered as a service by somebody with an unusual amount of insight into a particular consumer and who was already regularly talking about long-term life goals with them? It seems likely that if the proper approach to integrating life and financial goals was applied, consumers would find substantial value there.</p> <p>Joe Biden repeatedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I\u2019ll tell you what you value\u201d during the 2008 and 2012 US presidential elections. Those words were piercingly perceptive. As investment professionals, we are exposed to a vast array of explicit and implicit data about the values of our customers. Every decision to save or spend is reflective of the ambitions your clients have and the difficulties that they face in reaching them.</p> <p>How Can Financial Advisers Actually Help?</p> <p>It\u2019s not necessary to transform yourself from security analyst to psychologist to begin helping your clients reach both their life and financial goals. It can really be as simple as framing the goals that you discuss in a way that focuses on more than just their financial implications and by paying attention to a client\u2019s non-financial desires (like finding more time to read or doing yoga regularly) that might otherwise get ignored in favor of more \u201cheavyweight\u201d aspirations like retirement or buying a house.</p> <p>Though even listening to these goals is important, consider taking two simple steps to extend the conversation a bit further. It might be useful to encourage a conversation about pursuing non-financial aspirations as more than just an icebreaker. Get granular with them and figure out what they are driving after. Then jot down notes and discuss what would be a reasonable goal for them to pursue in time for your next annual or quarterly review. Some clients may find that this approach brings them additional insights and helps them work towards their ambitions.</p> <p>If you\u2019d like to get serious, structure these conversations so that you can discuss how often your clients are having the sorts of experiences that researchers have determined lead to happiness. Though these are not rigidly defined, they provide a framework for inquiry and can give you the opportunity to suggest objectives that may help your clients increase their overall happiness. Here are a few of the key elements that recur in academic discussions of what contributes to happiness. If you\u2019re really trying to understand what makes your clients tick, it might make sense to ask about them directly or indirectly:</p> <ul> <li>How often are they having new experiences?\u00a0They don\u2019t necessarily need to be traveling the world on a regular basis. Simply trying new restaurants or going on hikes from time to time can be enough.</li> <li>How do they play?\u00a0It could be golf, tiddlywinks, or\u00a0World of Warcraft. Experiencing the sensation of play is a powerful driver of happiness.</li> <li>How close are their relationships?\u00a0Friends and family are critical to feeling fulfillment in our lives, and grasping how your clients relate to these groups and the sort of satisfaction\u00a0they receive from them will greatly help you to understand them.</li> <li>Are they finding meaning?\u00a0A sense of meaning can be a powerful contributor to happiness, and most people are eager to talk about the areas of their lives where they are finding it. It could be through volunteer work, raising their children, or their day job.</li> <li>Do they appreciate the good things in their lives?\u00a0People who take time to reflect on their positive experiences by writing diaries or simply acknowledging the good times they\u2019ve had are found to be happier in general than those who don\u2019t.</li> </ul> <p>Integrating an understanding of what drives happiness into a wealth management practice can be useful in a lot of ways. On one hand, it gives advisers the opportunity to help clients work directly towards success and fulfillment, but it can also help them troubleshoot relationships with problem clients.</p> <p>This is just an armchair survey of a developing branch of human understanding, but if you find yourself intrigued consider watching the documentary\u00a0Happy, which talks through the research in some more depth and gives examples of particular aspects of happiness in detail. It might be a powerful set of information to tuck away.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["wealth management","personal finance"]},{"location":"blog/2014/12/05/zombies-strategy-and-the-future-of-the-planet/","title":"Zombies, Strategy, and the Future of the Planet","text":"<p>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor. </p> <p>This is a bit of a different take on Weekend Reads, as I am filling in for the excellent Dave Larrabee, CFA, and thought I would take the opportunity to share some of the papers I find valuable. I have long maintained an \u201cinteresting articles\u201d Dropbox folder where I place the best and most timeless pieces I\u2019ve ever read. Whenever somebody I don\u2019t see often asks me to send along anything interesting I\u2019ve come across, I share that folder with them.</p> <p>As you might guess, this is a mediocre way to share knowledge. For one thing, a whole bunch of PDFs doesn\u2019t necessarily lend itself to easy perusal. For another, a gigantic block of PDFs is rather inscrutable. Why is there an article about\u00a0soybeans in Uruguay\u00a0next to my folder on systematic trading? My only answer until now has been, \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d</p> <p>So this post is intended to make amends. Reading any of the pieces below is guaranteed* to make you smarter, better looking, and vastly wealthier. With two exceptions, they are also likely to keep well. For fairness\u2019s sake, I have excluded all of the great content published by my colleagues.</p> <p>Without Further Ado</p> <p>Let\u2019s start by looking at the stuff you might not expect. The paper \u201cDeath and Taxes and Zombies\u201d follows on the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s guide to surviving a zombie apocalypse, and actually provides an interesting window into estate planning. Adam Chodorow\u2019s meditation on determining whether a zombie is alive or dead is worth reading in and of itself, but the paper affords some serious insight into what happens taxwise when you or a partner die. If you hand it to a client, they are likely to actually read it. Plus, it contains the phrase \u201cwhile it seems unlikely anyone would become a zombie for tax purposes,\u201d so you know it\u2019s good.</p> <p>Were a zombie apocalypse to actually occur, it would likely become important to stop it. In that case, I\u2019d want whoever was in charge of responding to have read the excellent paper, \u201cLeverage Points: Places to Intervene In a System,\u201d by Donella Meadows. This is perhaps the best introduction to the analysis of complex systems that I can imagine, and I find myself continuously referring to her framework when I am structuring my own response to an issue.</p> <p>In thinking through responses to complex issues, it is common to use the word \u201cstrategy\u201d . . . in many cases again and again. If you\u2019ve ever heard someone use the word and found yourself muttering, \u201cYou keep using that word . . . I do not think it means what you think it means,\u201d you need to read \u201cWhat Is Strategy?\u201d the seminal paper from Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter. I love the idea of looking at companies as systems of activities, which Porter does almost magically well here. It\u2019s also worth reading because someday somebody might ask you what strategy is, and you should probably have an answer.</p> <p>Time for Some Investing Stuff</p> <p>Sometimes people ask you for a quick thing to read about investing, and that can be tough to respond to well. Fortunately, Walter Schloss typed out a list, entitled \u201cFactors Needed to Make Money in the Stock Market,\u201d that fills that gap nicely. It also offers the opportunity to make a very important point about investing information: the shiniest, best-packaged information is almost never the most valuable.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom often falls into that category. Many have been told that it is impossible to beat the market. It is probably hard, but those who hold that view need to examine the fantastic work Antii Petajisto has done in \u201cActive Share and Mutual Fund Performance.\u201d It\u2019s not only quite readable but may fundamentally transform the way you think if you have been browbeaten into believing there is no point in attempting to practice the craft of investing.</p> <p>I have two more recommendations in this category. One you likely expect (pictured below) and another that you really should have a look at. The\u00a0Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook\u00a0is perhaps one of the most valuable documents printed each year. For the sort who likes to know how the world is coming along, it is truly required reading.</p> <p>This next one I hope you were able to guess. After all, the author is more or less responsible for CFA Institute existing. . . .</p> <p>Thinking Long-Term</p> <p>In closing, I\u2019ll leave you with a number of \u201clong-range planning\u201d documents for homework over the upcoming holidays. It\u2019s long surprised me that people don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to listen when the Chinese government tells you what it\u2019s planning to do, the\u00a0US National Intelligence Council\u00a0talks about the trends it sees materializing, or the UN lays out broad goals for human development. These documents are perhaps one or two levels of magnitude\u00a0less material than the Magna Carta or the Declaration of Independence to the path of human history, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s altogether improbable that\u00a0your grandchildren will learn what\u2019s discussed in them in history class someday.</p> <p>First, if you\u2019re at all concerned that China is slowing down, you need to read\u00a0China 2030, which was published in 2012 by the\u00a0World Bank\u00a0and China\u2019s\u00a0Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC).</p> <p>Similarly, don\u2019t you want to know\u00a0what the US\u00a0National Intelligence\u00a0Council thinks are going to be the biggest trends\u00a0in the same time horizon? I\u2019d candidly be disappointed if you didn\u2019t, and fortunately they\u2019ve even made their report available in\u00a0Kindle format.</p> <p>How do both of these documents compare with investment reality? Let\u2019s ask investment reality. The\u00a0World Investment Report 2014\u00a0issued by the UN tracks flows in foreign direct investment (FDI) and issues commentary about what\u2019s happening in the world. It\u2019s worth at least a skim.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should definitely subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["eclectica","wealth management","macro"]},{"location":"blog/2014/12/09/grumpy-cat-means-business/","title":"Grumpy Cat Means Business","text":"<p>The Internet is a funny place.

There are also\u00a0many reasons to love them\u00a0apart from how good they taste when fried.</p> <p>Despite arguments in their favor, potatoes are illiquid, prone to going rotten, and infrequently used as investments by professionals. Though investment vehicles often come with well-designed tear sheets or prestigious packaging, one or more of these three characteristics apply to more of them than you might think.</p> <p>The Questionable\u00a0List</p> <ul> <li>Levered ETFs:\u00a0Leverage is alluring. It amplifies gains and (as is often forgotten) losses, but critiquing levered ETFs is different from critiquing the use of leverage. If these securities only provided leverage, I would say that they\u2019re probably not intended for amateurs but are not intrinsically bad for long-term investors. That is not the case. While they often succeed in matching the returns of the indices they are trying to track on a daily basis, the constant leverage they employ means that they cannot provide tidily leveraged returns. Research\u00a0summarized in\u00a0CFA Digestsuggests that the most likely long-term outcome for a levered ETF position is about 1.4 times the return with about twice the risk (as measured by standard deviation).</li> <li>High-Cost Variable Annuities:\u00a0Nobody likes paying taxes, least of all me. Variable annuities offer investors the opportunity to put away money tax free and invest it in various securities, often deferring taxes until the money is withdrawn. I should love this, right? There\u2019s only one problem: Most American investors could access that benefit essentially for free with an IRA or 401(k) account. So why would anyone ever buy a variable annuity? Well, they carry hefty commissions, which may lead salespeople looking out for their own interests to push them wherever they can. If you\u2019ve truly maxed out all of your tax deferral options, it may be worth considering a variable annuity, but it\u2019s doubtful\u00a0the fancy one that the Brylcreemed salesperson is talking to you about is the right one for you. While we were doing the research for this\u00a0primer on variable annuities, I found that there were almost always low-cost options available. I also found that a good way to see if something was expensive was to count the number of adjectives in its title. If it\u2019s described as \u201cpremier,\u201d \u201cexecutive,\u201d \u201caccelerated,\u201d or anything similar, there\u2019s an excellent chance you can find a lower cost option.</li> <li>Stocks You Hear about in E-Mail Spam:\u00a0It surprises me that anyone buys anything based on e-mail spam, but the\u00a0economics of e-mail spam\u00a0suggest that some people do. I and most professional investors would not buy a stock just because we got a research note from Goldman Sachs\u00a0\u2014 even if it was hand delivered by\u00a0Lloyd Blankfein\u00a0\u2014 so why would you outsource your judgment to some random guy on the Internet? The tippers often suggest that they have knowledge a company is likely to introduce a new and revolutionary product, but in truth that\u2019s most likely either insider trading or a lie. Often these spammers have large blocks of stock they are looking to unload onto unwitting suckers, and if you buy their story that sucker is you. You never want to buy anything you don\u2019t understand, especially if the person telling you to buy it is a stranger on the Internet.</li> <li>Non-Traded REITs:\u00a0In order to realize a return, you need to be able to perform a couple of important steps. The first is buying something at a price that it will likely go up from, but the second is perhaps more important: selling it for more than you paid. Investing in something where the latter portion of the process is imperiled is a bad idea unless the potential returns are so significant that they justify the risks . . . and you are truly qualified to evaluate those risks. Non-traded REITs, which are by definition illiquid and\u00a0have charged commissions higher than 10% in some cases, have somehow\u00a0managed to attract the love of their investor base. The arguments in favor of these vehicles often rest on the premise\u00a0that because they don\u2019t trade often, they are less risky. This is a facade. True risk is best thought of as the likelihood you will lose your money, not a statistical concept. Since commissions on these are so high, there is a certain loss embedded in the product, and it\u2019s not like there are no alternatives. There are plenty of\u00a0lists available online\u00a0of\u00a0publicly traded REITs, so I\u2019m confident you can find a fund that suits your needs without paying a large upfront commission.</li> </ul> <p>How\u2019d I do? Do you think I\u2019m being unfair to illiquid REITs? Too laudatory of potatoes? Leave a comment and I promise that in honor of a belated\u00a0National Mail a Potato Day on 18 December, I will personally mail you a potato if you post in defense of any of these investments in the comments section.

It was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor. </p> <p>I\u2019ve collected 29 charts over the last several\u00a0days that I think are worth your attention. But before you skim them you should really read the next three paragraphs.</p> <p>There are some major analytical errors that you can make if you use charts the wrong way. Seriously. For one, it\u2019s always necessary to actually source the data yourself. These are images on the Internet, and so even though I think they\u2019re credible and want to believe they\u2019re true, you have to be an enterprising investor and verify them yourself. After all, I want to believe\u00a0this image\u00a0is real, too.</p> <p>So you should look at these charts, think about and corroborate them, but you should also study the excellent work my colleague Jason Voss, CFA, has done highlighting the subtleties of analyzing charts well. His\u00a0r-squared chart taxonomy\u00a0would be required reading if I ran the world.</p> <p>Anyway, we\u2019re coming to the end of the previously specified three paragraphs of text, so I will suggest you\u00a0subscribe to the\u00a0Enterprising Investor\u00a0if you like this sort of thing.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the things that\u2019s intriguing\u00a0about this chart is the repeat appearances on it. I sometimes hear from market participants that a country or issuer wouldn\u2019t default/devalue because then markets \u201cwould never\u201d lend to them or trust their currency again. Oh really? Seems a lot more like the markets have pretty short memories.</p> <p></p> <p>This one is\u00a0remarkable\u00a0because it shows that central banks have been printing money more or less in a straight line since since even before the financial crisis is officially demarcated. I don\u2019t think anybody has argued seriously that they are printing money only to address the financial crisis\u00a0\u2014 there is a broader economic malaise it caused as well\u00a0\u2014 but it\u2019s noteworthy\u00a0both how constant the growth is and how small a trillion dollars looks on this chart.</p> <p></p> <p>One of my favorite mental models comes from the excellent\u00a0Todd Harrison, who coined the\u00a0phrase \u201cthe path of maximum frustration.\u201d An unexpectedly cold Arctic winter which leads to the expansion of the polar ice caps at an unusually fast clip seems like exactly that, since climate scientists must convince a scientifically illiterate population that action is needed to put the breaks on climate change. This data point may make an appearance in domestic political conversations in the coming year as environmental legislation is debated again.</p> <p></p> <p>Almost as compelling\u00a0as the stated point of this chart\u00a0\u2014 asset bubbles, indeed, are difficult to identify\u00a0\u2014 is the transformation that\u2019s taken place in the S&amp;P 500 over the last 40 years. If I had made this chart, I might have titled it \u201cThe Amazing Disappearing Telecom, Materials, and Utilities Industries.\u201d Watching them vanish from large cap indices is a provocative look at how domestic markets have evolved.</p> <p></p> <p>Any change in a long-term trend is worth paying attention to, and here we have a particularly important one. Almost exactly 10\u00a0years ago, the housing industry was so hot that it seemed like an engine for obvious, permanent wealth creation. It\u2019s interesting that the vacancy rate has been flat for so long. Is it really possible that household balance sheets are healthy enough that people are choosing to buy instead of rent? I hope so.</p> <p></p> <p>The $8-trillion figure given in this study is a specific number attached to a forecast, and as such is guaranteed to be wrong, but it\u2019s important\u00a0to note our susceptibility to the decline in effectiveness of our antibiotics.\u00a0A new drug has just been uncovered that has a lot of promise, but it\u2019s always worth remembering that we\u2019re in an arms race with evolution.</p> <p></p> <p>After years of flat-screen televisions being the epitome of cool, it\u2019s kind of wonderful that curved screens are the new hot thing . . . at least according to the television manufacturers trying desperately to upsell us on them. To me, it seems like it\u2019s getting cheaper and more competitive to produce television screens that are larger and better than ever before. I have a seven-year-old HDTV that cost more than $1500 but could be replaced for $399. It seems like low-end televisions are awesome enough that most consumers are wondering why they would ever shell out money for the new hotness, unless they like setting money on fire . . .</p> <p></p> <p>The new\u00a0JP Morgan Guide to the Markets\u00a0is out, and it\u2019s worth a read. I should have said \u201csince mid 2009\u201d in my tweet above, but it\u2019s remarkable how consistently S&amp;P 500 companies have favored buybacks over dividends. It\u2019s also remarkable that companies are now returning ~$176 billion to shareholders per quarter, versus ~$140 billion in 2007\u20132008. Measured from there, it\u2019s a pathetic compound growth rate. Measured from the next year\u00a0\u2014 when it grew from ~$80 billion\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p></p> <p>It looks like banks have been wary of real estate loans ever since almost being ruined by them during the financial crisis. Maybe that ends now? It\u2019s a bit worrisome that commercial and industrial loans have been so far above the median for so long, and real estate loans are only just catching up. Does this speak more to changing risk appetites on the lending side or changes in the demand equation for housing?</p> <p></p> <p>It\u2019s not my job to make stock picks, but rather to filter the world\u2019s investment information and provide helpful perspective. Last year, I published a series of conversations I had with prominent investors in India, and one of them\u00a0cautioned that one of the more significant mistakes foreign investors make in allocating to India is buying into mega-cap names\u00a0. . . like those in the SENSEX. Enterprising investors who believe the bullish argument on India are likely best served investigating the names that aren\u2019t as widely followed.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>This chart speaks for itself. Software is a real thing, and we need to stop pretending software companies are just a bunch of kids in hoodies.</p> <p></p> <p>Our New York City office is about two blocks from the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, otherwise known as the Mecca of selfies. I have had the distinct pleasure of observing couple after couple taking their picture in front of the tree with a\u00a0selfie stick, and I have to say there\u2019s something endearing about it . . . even if it\u2019s intrinsically ridiculous. The selfie stick serves as a reminder that it is just as difficult to predict the values underlying technological progress as its course and application. I hope this is just a fad (because . . . come on), but I can\u2019t really get that bent out of shape about something that makes it easier for people to commemorate moments together.</p> <p></p> <p>My understanding of the oil and gas business is that \u201ctypical\u201d wells are about as easy to find as \u201cnormal market conditions.\u201d But that said, wells that have been fracked experience a substantial drop-off in production that isn\u2019t talked about enough.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that although these rigs decline in production over time, we have also been getting better at extraction. Those declines may come from a higher base.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>It\u2019s also important to remember that a lot of people talk about commodities \u2014\u00a0and particularly oil prices\u00a0\u2014 as trading very cyclically. We can only learn a limited amount by comparing such a long time series to the present\u00a0\u2014 oil markets before the invention of the telephone bear little resemblance to those of today in terms of supply, demand, or even location\u00a0\u2014 but the chart is provocative, as Callum observes.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>There will almost certainly be a time in my investment career when Africa is hailed as the engine of global growth. Will that era\u00a0begin this year?\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>Our members certainly aren\u2019t all that bullish on South Africa, France, and Brazil.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Last year they were pretty bullish on the world economy though. If I were you, I\u2019d read this year\u2019s\u00a0Global Market Sentiment Survey.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>If you read it last year, you probably would have noticed a decent shift in sentiment about Japan.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And the significant concerns about a real estate bubble among members in the Asia-Pacific region.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>I\u2019m consistently amazed at people\u2019s willingness to confuse bitcoin the technology with bitcoin the asset. The technology and its core innovations \u2014 lower authentication fees, peer-to-peer transactions, and so on\u00a0\u2014 are\u00a0amazing, but the asset itself is confusing to value and not necessarily tied to the adoption of the technology.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>Following up on the preceding chart, can you believe that bitcoin performed even worse than the Russian ruble in 2014?\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>And it\u2019s worth remembering what the long-term trend in the US dollar looks like as we close out a year in which the US Dollar Index has rallied in almost a straight line since mid-summer.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>This is a gorgeous piece of analysis. It might be natural to think that the Russian market would be categorically \u201ccheap\u201d right now, especially considering the troubles they\u2019ve had recently. If you factor in the market\u2019s assessment of the credit risk, not so much. Turkey jumps off the page as being worth consideration here, but if this chart serves any purpose it is as a reminder that any one factor is never dispositive in investment research. Enterprising investors should always look for harmony in a series of statistics, sensations, and sentiments, rather than a \u201csmoking gun\u201d number.</p> <p></p> <p>I was in Times Square last Thursday night to see a show and had planned on meeting friends at Shake Shack for a burger and a beer beforehand. I was shocked to find there was a line outside the door in sub-freezing temperatures. Humorously, across the street there was an empty McDonald\u2019s with hundreds of unwanted Big Mac coupons littering the ground outside. It\u2019s tough to imagine a more succinct encapsulation of the relative demand for the two restaurants.</p> <p></p> <p>Trade flows are important to analyze, but how often do you look at information flows? This chart highlights the regional power of South Africa and Nigeria, as well as the impressive\u00a0regional dominance of China. Seen this way, India seems like an international power but not a regional one, and the United Arab Emirates may have just barely eclipsed Saudi Arabia in regional influence.</p> <p></p> <p>Austria is attracting an impressive proportion of skilled immigrants, which surprised me. It\u2019s also interesting to note the relative levels of brain drain among the PIIGS countries\u00a0\u2014 Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain\u00a0\u2014 which have long been considered the chief exporters of economic woes to their co-members of the European Union. Ireland seems to be attracting far more skilled laborers than one might expect for an economic basket case.</p> <p></p> <p>In closing, cheers from the northeastern United States, where it has recently been colder than Mars.

What\u2019s causing it? And most importantly if you\u2019re an investor, what the heck do you do about it?</p> <p>Let\u2019s find out. And be advised: if you\u2019re not particularly concerned about deflation, you should probably get your head examined. Though you might have more fun checking out\u00a0the other charts post\u00a0I wrote recently.</p> <p>The warning that I published in that article applies triply to these charts: They are just pretty pictures! If you read this and then use it to make investment decisions without verifying its content, you\u2019ll literally\u00a0wipe the smile right off of my face.</p> <p>And as usual, if you dig this sort of stuff (and promise to think for yourself), you should subscribe to my newsletter. </p> <p></p> <p>In case you were wondering if it was just you (or really just me) who\u2019s thinking about deflation, you\u2019re incorrect. Google search volume for \u201cdeflation\u201d is rising to levels not seen since 2009.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And the regional breakout is interesting too. Austrians are second after Nigerians . . .</p> <p></p> <p>. . . but empirically are the least deflated members of the European Union. I noted\u00a0last time\u00a0that they were attracting a crazy share of immigration inside the eurozone, so it might be worth digging in a bit more. Anyone want to grab a drink in Vienna?</p> <p></p> <p>The picture of the aggregate doesn\u2019t look good at all though.</p> <p></p> <p>And the growth in negative-yielding government debt is clearly alarming, though it\u2019s important to remember that a negative stated yield and an investor return are not the same thing. In a deflationary environment, money gets more valuable. Getting \u20ac.99 back in a year on your investment of \u20ac1.00 might be a pretty good deal if those \u20ac.99 can buy a whole lot of stuff all of a sudden.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s zoom out a bit and think about what deflation really is. I find this 800-year chart of the Swedish consumer price index (CPI) oddly comforting when I remember that humans actually managed to live through the multicentury period of pronounced inflation and deflation that is pictured here. That said, it does highlight that we live in an unusual era of monetary peace. The\u00a0article\u00a0that this tweet links to also includes a great chart relating the US\u00a0CPI to stock performance (spoiler: no relation) as well as the excellent observation that while the world was on the gold standard, deflation had to follow inflation: you couldn\u2019t change the monetary base at will!</p> <p></p> <p>Still, it does look like we Americans may be joining our colleagues in Europe sooner than we\u2019d like. A whole host of US economic data has disappointed.</p> <p></p> <p>And this time series of the CPI doesn\u2019t look cheery, although it\u2019s worth noting that it managed to correct back in 2011, and the Europeans are talking about a \u201cbig\u201d round of quantitative easing (QE).</p> <p>That\u2019s not the only thing we need to think about though. The US dollar has rallied massively and oil is getting crushed. Are we really surprised by an environment where individuals are paying less for things?</p> <p>It is also somewhat typical for us to go through a period when initially rosy estimates are rolled back. We literally do it every year, since forecasts are really just a way of having a conversation about expectations and it\u2019s natural to be optimistic.</p> <p>There has definitely been an impact on the earnings guidance that firms have been issuing though. It\u2019s possible that this is reflective of investor relations teams\u2019 tendency to seek lower expectations that are easier to exceed, but the zero line in this time series is clearly related to recessions.</p> <p>Just like this one.</p> <p>So what do you do? It depends, but it\u2019s worth remembering that things still have a tendency to grow over long time horizons, despite disastrous events and unbelievable volatility.</p> <p>The trick for enterprising investors will be to stay focused on what\u2019s really important. In life, that means being a positive influence on yourself and those around you. In investing (whether the outlay is your dollars or your time), that means focusing on what you\u2019ll get back later from what you part with, and what you\u2019ll be able to do with that. In a deflationary environment, money increases in value automatically, which stalls investment and defers consumption.</p> <p>What\u2019s the best trade you can put on in your personal account to ensure your financial success in such an environment?

What followed was a multi-day period during which I spent a lot of quality time with Microsoft Excel, ate all of the animal crackers in our New York City office, and repeatedly apologized to editor Paul McCaffrey\u00a0for turning this post in late.</p> <p>So what set me wondering?\u00a0</p> <p>Egypt\u00a0made headlines\u00a0over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend by attacking Islamic State militants in Libya. The militants had apparently beheaded 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in a brutal mass execution. Given the well-documented violence and disorder in Libya, I wondered what had driven the victims to locate there.</p> <p>It turns out they knowingly risked their lives to find work. After speaking to an Egyptian Christian who said he plans to go to Libya soon as well, the BBC ended the segment with a stark assertion: many people would rather die seeking work in Libya than go on living in abject poverty where they are.</p> <p>Wow</p> <p>For those suffering from the injustice of extreme poverty, life is a series of difficult choices. Evaluating the merits of various career options is rarely one of them. Thinking people tend to hope for a world where living standards rise across the board, but too often this hope omits a depressing question: What is keeping this from happening? Though it\u2019s beyond the scope of one article to suggest comprehensive causality, in this piece I\u2019m going to examine growth in capital and labor markets in an attempt to piece out the places in the world \u2014 like Egypt \u2014 where exogenous factors are inhibiting GDP growth. (I will leave it up to others, hopefully with a lot more smarts than I currently possess, to isolate what precisely those factors are.)</p> <p>I\u2019m going to do this by looking at two components of growth\u00a0\u2014 growth in labor and growth in the money supply \u2014 as well as growth itself. There are a couple of limitations to this analysis. The first \u2014\u00a0a big one \u2014 is that I\u2019m really supposed to be looking at\u00a0capital rather than money\u00a0in traditional growth accounting. I\u2019m also supposed to piece out the amount of aggregate growth attributable to both labor and capital individually. I chose to proceed with money (and also to ignore the second step of the analysis) for a couple of reasons.</p> <p>The biggest is that I couldn\u2019t value every single capital asset in the world accurately if I had the cooperation of every one of the 130,000-plus CFA Institute members on the planet and a full year. It might take that long just to settle on an appropriate discount rate. That\u2019s before we talk about the precise attribution of growth to different factors, which would likely take even longer.</p> <p>I\u2019m okay with using money instead of capital because this is intrinsically a \u201cback-of-the-envelope\u201d exercise. I am just mapping national growth using a consistent method, not trying to work towards a new truth in economics. My hope is that this work is helpful in generating ideas for further\u00a0research as well as in digesting global growth patterns. If it inspires a heated discussion about the difference between stocks and flows in economics or a better stand-in for capital, I\u2019m all ears. If you include a link to a time series, I might even update the charts.</p> <p>A note for chart aficionados: you should definitely subscribe to my newsletter. </p> <p>And without further ado . . .</p> <p>The Global Labor Force</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0The World Bank</p> <p>I figured I\u2019d start this off with something that represents \u201cconsensus\u201d thinking.\u00a0</p> <p>In many conversations about growth, there are three places that tend to be the focus of discussion: the developed world (represented by the OECD, which was at one time\u00a0referred to as a \u201cclub of the rich\u201d\u00a0and is never growing fast enough to satisfy), China, and India. In terms of how to slice up the globe, this can be a useful strategy.\u00a0</p> <p>But if we start by just considering the labor force, there is\u00a0\u2014 quite literally\u00a0\u2014 an entire world of growth that is obscured by that method . . .</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0The World Bank</p> <p>And that the non-China, non-India, non-OECD labor force is growing at a much faster rate than in the three places mentioned above. Now remember: Growth in the labor force only represents potential economic growth, not actual or even probable growth. But let\u2019s set that aside for a moment. Which countries\u2019 labor forces grew the fastest from 1999\u20132013?</p> <p>Cumulative Labor Force Growth 1999\u20132013</p> <p>This chart is misleading on purpose.\u00a0</p> <p>Some countries grew so fast that they threw off the scale and made the comparison less meaningful. So I stripped them out of the above. Those countries where the labor force grew by 70% or more from 1999\u20132013 are below.</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0The World Bank</p> <p>I colored the countries that are traditionally considered part of the Middle East blue. Did you expect these results?</p> <p>Granted, this is not necessarily material at the global level, but it doesn\u2019t need to be to be interesting. The 14\u00a0countries shown here had just over 42-million people in their labor forces in 2013, but given that they had just over 19 million in 1999, it warrants some examination. It seems clear a remarkable transformation is taking place in the Middle East. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why CFA Institute has been holding an annual\u00a0Middle East Investment Conference\u00a0for the last few years, one of the factors that makes the region interesting should be clearer now. There are a lot of people looking for something to do.</p> <p>The Global Money Supply</p> <p>So what about the money part of this equation? Well, let\u2019s take a look at another pie chart.</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0The World Bank</p> <p>Perhaps this chart is why people are so focused on the OECD, China, and India? It makes sense that if roughly 90% of the world\u2019s money is flowing around those places, they merit substantial attention. . . .</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0The World Bank</p> <p>This slide is just in case you didn\u2019t notice how outsized China was in the previous chart. China\u2019s economic growth is probably grist in and of itself for another charts post. But suffice it to say, China\u2019s money supply expanded by more than an order of magnitude from 1999\u20132013. If a roughly average-sized baby (48.5 cm in length) was to grow at the same rate over the same period, we would have an adolescent who is more than 4.8-meters tall on our hands.</p> <p>A note on the data here: I\u2019ve seen different numbers from different sources on M2 levels in these countries but decided to stick with the World Bank numbers just to stay as consistent as possible. Now that I\u2019ve disclaimed suitably, we can ask the important question: Is China to money supply what the United Arab Emirates is to the labor force? Let\u2019s take a look.</p> <p>Cumulative Money Supply Growth 1999\u20132013</p> <p>Actually, that\u2019d be Azerbaijan you\u2019re looking for, but China\u2019s not\u00a0so\u00a0far off. If you look past Azerbaijan\u2019s 4,471% growth in money supply over this period, China is looking pretty good. I\u2019ll flag as well that at 1,654% and 860%, respectively, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates also had some substantial money supply growth.</p> <p>Global GDP</p> <p>Now, my initial plan was to look at money supply and labor force growth\u00a0and then see how actual economic growth has correlated with what we might have imputed from looking only at those two factors. Before we do that, let\u2019s look at how global GDP was distributed in 1999.</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0The World Bank</p> <p>And compare that to how it\u2019s distributed now.</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0The World Bank</p> <p>The timescale here is an interesting one for the purposes of this comparison. During the transition from the Pac-Man distribution of GDP to the eccentric pizza distribution, the world has gone through nearly two complete economic cycles. As you can sense from these two point-in-time illustrations, the gap in growth has been substantial.</p> <p></p> <p>Source:\u00a0The World Bank</p> <p>It\u2019s getting easier and easier for me to assume you agree that the OECD is not the engine of global growth \u2014 and, hopefully, that you\u2019re willing to hang on for one more chart, tops. So here you go:</p> <p>The Gap between What You\u2019d Expect from Money Supply and Labor Force Growth and What Actually Happened</p> <p>This chart has a straightforward question underpinning it: where did GDP growth not map roughly to money supply and labor force growth?</p> <p>To answer that, I did something really lazy. I just took the average of the money supply and labor force growth rates, and subtracted that from the growth rate in GDP. In most cases, I got a relatively small number, indicating that GDP growth was basically in line with money supply and labor force growth. It\u2019s important to note, of course, that this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship.</p> <p>In a few cases though, I saw something interesting. In the countries that are colored deep green (like Indonesia), economic growth was much faster than the growth in labor and the money supply. Conversely, with ruby red countries like Azerbaijan, economic growth was much slower.</p> <p>These extreme readings suggest that something (which is up to you to determine) is happening in these countries. Fortunately I\u2019m not allowed to make macro calls from my current seat, so I\u2019m conveniently absolved of the responsibility to tell you exactly what to do.</p> <p>This is also, as I said, a massively \u201cback-of-the-envelope\u201d exercise, so it\u2019s a bit premature to pairs trade the Ukraine against Angola . . . and even if you think you should, I\u2019ll note that these index ratings are not actually meaningful except in reference to the other numbers published in the chart.</p> <p>There are a couple of good takeaways though. One that I think should be considered is how well this actually relates to growth in many advanced economies. This method is only off by 5% in computing the actual growth rate of the United States economy over this period, and off by almost exactly the same amount in Japan. Is it possible that economic growth is just a function of money supply and labor force growth in these advanced economies?</p> <p>The former Soviet Union is also (pardon the pun) covered in red. This should be intuitive for those who remember the\u00a0Russian Financial Crisis of 1998, which put many of these countries at a disadvantage over this time period.</p> <p>It should also be straightforward that there is a glut of supply in the Middle Eastern labor market, and an interesting question for those who make money with capital should also be straightforward. Is there an investment that will harness the implicit human capital of this rapidly growing labor force?</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should definitely subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["macro","economic geography","development economics"]},{"location":"blog/2015/03/04/apple-macro-trends-and-global-inequality/","title":"Apple, Macro Trends, and Global Inequality","text":"<p>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Am I the only one starting to feel like we\u2019re pretty darn late in the business cycle?\u00a0</p> <p>With venture capital investment\u00a0surpassing 1999 quarterly levels\u00a0and\u00a0cyclically adjusted P/E ratios\u00a0that reach ever skyward, it\u2019s certainly getting easier to pursue that line of argumentation.

It was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>About 10\u00a0days ago\u00a0a young man passed away to whom CFA Institute owes a lot. He was 109. His name was Irving Kahn, CFA.</p> <p>I never had the pleasure of meeting him, but I do have the honor of starting a discussion about his legacy in this forum and talking about what his example means to me \u2014\u00a0and what it should mean to professional investors everywhere.</p> <p>Why do we choose to honor this man? Perhaps it\u2019s because as a teaching assistant to\u00a0Benjamin Graham, he watched and guided the creation of this industry from the very beginning. Or perhaps it\u2019s because he belonged to\u00a0the first class of CFA charterholders, a group of people\u00a0who set in motion a social movement that helped professionalize the world of investing. He was among the founders of the\u00a0New York Society of Security Analysts, one of our largest societies, as well as the\u00a0Financial Analysts Journal, a sister\u00a0publication\u00a0to the\u00a0Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Or maybe it\u2019s because, at 109 years old, he still loved the stuff that we professional investors do day in and day out. Kahn was still working when he passed away, even though he had more than earned his retirement and could have moved somewhere with a better climate than New York City and lived a life of leisure.</p> <p>I Guess He Just Loved This Game.</p> <p>The investment industry is considered boring by the uninitiated. We are unrepentant geeks. We print out annual reports and read them in alphabetical order. Our nicknames for things \u2014\u00a0the Swissie, crack spreads, 2s10s \u2014\u00a0make literally no sense to other people. When our contemporaries are profiled in the media, they often come off as morally bankrupt. This characterization is so common that it\u2019s\u00a0discussed as a TV Trope.</p> <p>So when we, or at least, when I see a distinguished investor quietly grinding out alpha\u00a0because he likes it, I find it inspiring. I like it, too.</p> <p>And hearing about someone else who likes it makes me feel like a little bit less of a nerd. So in part I honor him because I hope I can retain his enthusiasm. But I also honor him because there is much to learn from his example. In particular, I think he did three things that every professional investor should emulate.</p> <p>He Read Different\u00a0News Sources.</p> <p>One of the more intriguing stories about Irving that I\u2019ve come across is that he was actually responsible for the expansion of the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0to the United States. In the early 1950s, he would \u2014 at great expense \u2014 procure copies of the pink paper because he was fascinated with European companies. When he later traveled to London, he met with the\u00a0FT\u00a0to see if he could convince them to begin publishing in the United States. They laughed at him. By the time he was\u00a0profiled for\u00a0CFA Magazine, they had been hand delivering a weekend\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0to him for more than 40\u00a0years as a way of saying \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He Didn\u2019t Keep His Knowledge to Himself.</p> <p>When Irving got to Wall Street, \u201canalyst\u201d was not a job title. Analysts were called statisticians. We owe the existence of the investment management profession in large part to the work of Irving and his mentor Benjamin Graham, who would trek up from Wall Street to Columbia Business School after work to teach others how to properly analyze companies. Many people would have just turned in year after year of stellar performance and allowed their investors to believe they were magicians instead of passing on their knowledge.</p> <p>He Kept Learning.</p> <p>There are very few widely respected investors who don\u2019t spend most of their time engaged in their primary job: learning new stuff. Kahn could have decided after 30 (or 40, 50, 60, or even 70) years of experience that he had all the knowledge he needed, and fallen into the trap of trying to force markets to fit his well-constructed beliefs rather than updating them.

This business has two types of units: those that make what the business sells and those that enable those units.</p> <p>This is simple\u00a0at first. At a bubblegum company, you can usually figure out who is involved in making the bubble gum and who is focused on taking care of other problems so that the company can make bubble gum.</p> <p>The vice president of new flavors? Definitely on the \u201cmaking things\u201d side. The CFO? Almost always on the \u201cother stuff\u201d side.</p> <p>It turns out that what\u2019s true for the individual or the unit is true for the industry. The products and services that the financial industry provides are usually not ends in themselves. They are built to fulfill goals that others \u2014 organizations and individuals \u2014 have.</p> <p>**So Finance Is for Facilitation **</p> <p>This should be obvious. When investment advisers construct a portfolio for an individual, they are taking a pool of assets and arranging it so that it can facilitate the client\u2019s livelihood. Investment bankers restructuring a company are doing the same thing: they are intervening to facilitate a future.</p> <p>In a lot of thinking along these lines, this is the part where the author tells you it\u2019s all about the client.</p> <p>Reactions to that tend to fall into one of two camps. You either nod self-assuredly and congratulate yourself for being one of the good ones\u00a0who already knew what was important. Or you close the browser tab with an eye roll and remark on how people\u00a0who talk about this sort of thing are always full of lofty rhetoric but offer little in the way of tangible suggestions.</p> <p>So I\u2019m not going to tell you anything\u00a0I already warned you to look out for. Instead, how about I suggest a few\u00a0areas where there is a real need for attention, where the tools of finance can have a positive and transformative impact? Places where, as far as I can tell, there is a chorus\u00a0standing on top of the industry and screaming:</p> <p>Financial Innovation Welcome!</p> <p>Let me lay out the areas that, according to consensus, appear ripe for disruption. These are the places where the horses are already well\u00a0out of the gate, and which you may have already heard about on the nightly news. They are:</p> <ul> <li>Disintermediating banking.\u00a0There is the payment side (with bitcoin and various apps) as well as the lending side, where peer-to-peer lending appears to promise a credit market free of middlemen. My colleague Ron Rimkus, CFA,\u00a0has written a lot about\u00a0the\u00a0bitcoin side of this equation, and it\u2019s probably wise to stay in touch with trends in this space. Especially if you own shares in banks that make money by charging fees to lend money and transfer it, it will pay to be aware of potential existential threats in this area.</li> <li>Replacing your financial adviser.\u00a0You haven\u2019t had to pay for financial advice for quite a few years, and\u00a0I\u2019m on the record saying that free financial advice will eventually be as common as free checking.</li> <li>Making better investment decisions.\u00a0I use\u00a0Sentieo\u00a0and\u00a0Quandl\u00a0(as well as a\u00a0Bloomberg) to simplify my research process, and with services like these, it\u2019s getting easier and easier for someone with questions to find the answers they need to make better decisions. Even the Twitter feeds I follow have become a powerful tool to learn more faster and improve my decision-making.</li> </ul> <p>There are definitely more things to be done. There are almost certainly new businesses that can be built in areas that I haven\u2019t mentioned but are still part of the traditional finance \u201cstack\u201d: insurance, maturity transformation, and capital raising, to name a few.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean the industry should think small.</p> <p>There is a refrain in public opinion that calls for something I will dub \u201clittle finance.\u201d This is finance without innovation. Finance as a utility. I want to focus on areas that aren\u2019t traditionally considered \u201cfinancial\u201d but could eventually be, in the hopes that it will encourage our readers to think a bit bigger.</p> <p>So, fully recognizing that our role as middlemen is and always will be to facilitate transactions on behalf of someone else who is acting with a clear end in mind, we need to be asking ourselves a simple question:</p> <p>What New Thing Can We Facilitate?</p> <p>There\u2019s no excellent reason that insights and practices from the investment profession can\u2019t be applied in new ways, and I think that there\u2019s a lot to be gained from doing that. It might sound weird to think about the way investors approach the world as a technology that can be applied to other fields. It might even look funny to try, but anyone who\u2019s ever\u00a0used chopsticks to eat Cheetos\u00a0knows that those risky ideas sometimes pay off. Here are three places where I think there might be room for something remarkable.</p> <ul> <li>Improving charitable donations.\u00a0There\u2019s a decent amount of evidence that charitable capital is allocated suboptimally. If you don\u2019t believe me, spend five minutes with Eric Friedman\u2019s\u00a0excellent\u00a0Reinventing Philanthropy\u00a0and then come back here and comment. There must be a way to turn a simple truth \u2014 most people don\u2019t think carefully about their charitable donations \u2014 into a product that people can really use.</li> <li>Bring power tools to budgeting.\u00a0As a straightforward example, most consumer-facing financial software like\u00a0Mint\u00a0and\u00a0Level Money\u00a0(which I use and love despite its shortcomings) allow an individual to create a version of a balance sheet and a cash flow statement. But they\u2019re missing something: income statements! These are invaluable in the analysis of companies, but consumers don\u2019t have access to them in evaluating their spending.</li> <li>Recontextualize the world.\u00a0There\u2019s a lot of evidence that people have a hard time budgeting.\u00a0Just one in three Americans do it, and I\u2019d bet that far fewer of those stick to their budgets. Part of that is likely because money is an arbitrary unit of account. What if we started building products that made people\u2019s financial transactions look more like the way they see the world? Hipsters could spend 400 lattes on rent instead of $1600 dollars, or maybe even 60 hours of work. If people can begin sensing money more intuitively, a lot of good things might happen.</li> </ul> <p>This all comes with a substantive caveat.\u00a0It\u2019s all my opinion.</p> <p>If you're interested in thinking big, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["purpose","investment industry","operating investment organizations"]},{"location":"blog/2015/05/01/is-shadow-banking-scary/","title":"Is Shadow Banking Scary?","text":"<p>This post was first published by CFA Institute.</p> <p>When I say \u201cshadow banking,\u201d do you think of money market and bond funds?

Do You Do It Intentionally?","text":"<p>The investment community is coming to a powerful consensus: Investments have impact. When you match unused capital with an unfunded need, the magic of business happens. That business has a first-order effect: making money. It also has a second-order effect: profitability. The emerging consensus I refer to is that the second-order effect is\u00a0worth assessing and even optimizing.</p> <p>If that sounds like \u201cimpact investing\u201d to you, you\u2019re not totally off base. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. Impact can be intentional or unintentional, but it can\u2019t be avoided. Given that, doesn\u2019t it make some sense, at minimum, to understand the follow-on effects of making an investment?</p> <p>But if you are still a bit skeptical about the notion of incorporating social good into your portfolio, that\u2019s understandable. For whatever reason, it is difficult for many people to think that a profit motive can be combined with something that improves the world. That\u2019s unfortunate, but it comes from a good place. After all:</p> <p>Investing Is Not a Philanthropic Enterprise.</p> <p>It would be great if the trillions of dollars entrusted to financial intermediaries could be devoted directly and wholly to social good. But that\u2019s not the way the world works. People entrust professionals to grow their assets so they can use them in the future. Making investment decisions without a focus on return makes that harder, and it harms our clients. That is infinitely worse than getting fired (which is also nearly certain to happen if you forget about your responsibility to seek a fair return).</p> <p>So it\u2019s a good thing you can actually find excellent returns by considering the impact of your investments. Tischhauser tossed a chart of his fund\u2019s returns up on the screen, and it went from bottom left to top right just like it was supposed to. There are return streams here that can be accessed.</p> <p>There may also be enduring edge. If one considers an almost stereotypical case of investing with impact, where one acts as a microfinance lender in a capital-starved market, it starts to become clear that if you get it right once, you might be able to get it right again. It also demonstrates that the local business environment might be quite uncorrelated with activity on Wall Street or anywhere else. Uncorrelated consistent returns are the holy grail of the investment industry. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could earn them by helping people?</p> <p>It would. That doesn\u2019t tell you how to do it, but it does convey the promise. A great number of funds are showing interest in these strategies. But you don\u2019t have to take my word for it. As Richard Brandweiner, CFA, who runs a $45-billion-plus superannuation fund (think pension fund if you\u2019re not Australian), said at the beginning of the session, \u201cInvesting with purpose is not a fringe idea, but we need to learn to do it better.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately, attendees did.\u00a0</p> <p>Here are a few quick things that you can do to catch up to those who made it to Frankfurt in the flesh:</p> <ul> <li>Read Michael E. Porter and Mark R. Kramer\u2019s \u201cCreating Shared Value.\u201d\u00a0It was widely referenced by speakers on this topic throughout the conference, and I\u2019m personally very much looking forward to spending some quality time with it, especially if it\u2019s at all as good as Porter\u2019s\u00a0\u201cWhat Is Strategy?\u201c\u00a0Debevoise suggested taking a look at the latter, as well as some other good next steps:</li> </ul> <p>Next steps from @nellddRead: https://t.co/eO32NT645PStudy: unilever, axa, etsyStudy metrics: iris, sasbCraft your job#FutureFinance</p>\u2014 Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) April 29, 2015 <ul> <li>Learn goal programming. It looks a bit wonky, but I found listening to Read\u2019s explanation of the discipline in the video above to be immensely clarifying. Goal programming is a system of balancing competing objectives that he suggests is a much better version of the asset allocation thinking that has been used in finance since the early 1960s. Time to upgrade your toolkit!</li> <li>Shift your perspective. Tischhauser noted that he first did this by taking a bike ride from Geneva to South Africa. The poverty that he witnessed led him to brainstorm creative solutions and ultimately start his own fund.\u00a0Andrew Sheng\u00a0noted in the earlier \u201cLong-Termism and the New Era of Fiduciary Capitalism\u201d panel that the sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia asks its employees to pursue a similar course. Travel somewhere without a capital market and think creatively. It can\u2019t hurt.</li> </ul> <p>Ultimately, we need to remember something critical in evaluating allocations to these countries: Poverty is a lack of choice. Investors raised in developed economies may not understand the firsthand experience of the very poor, but they can certainly grasp, at an atomic level, that entrepreneurship is about creating new choice.</p> <p>Backing entrepreneurs is also a great way to make money.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["impact investing","philanthropy","purpose"]},{"location":"blog/2015/07/20/are-financial-advisers-supposed-to-get-paid/","title":"Are Financial Advisers Supposed to Get Paid?","text":"<p>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor. </p> <p>For many investment professionals, the seemingly inexorable rise of robo-advisers constitutes an existential\u00a0threat. The fear is simple and justified: Services now exist that provide investors with a portfolio that fits their expressed risk tolerance and reward inclinations for 0.25% of the assets invested in that portfolio.</p> <p>That\u2019s a great deal. Financial advisers offering a similar service at higher cost are in a tough place.</p> <p>If we use the example of a financial adviser currently making $75,000 a year, one who splits their fee down the middle with their firm, we can see this pretty clearly. At a 1% fee, this adviser can make a comfortable middle-class income if they spend 60 hours a week talking to 100 or so happy clients with a grand total of $15 million invested with the firm.</p> <p>If their fee were lowered to 0.25% of assets, the adviser would need to either take on more clients (and provide less service to existing ones) or seek wealthier clients. Either way, their firm would need $60 million in assets instead of $15 million to make the same amount of money. Like, duh, right?</p> <p>If losing that much in fees worries you, a widely shared blog post should terrify you.\u00a0Blake Ross, who co-founded Firefox before spending six years at Facebook as director of product, maintains that\u00a0those already-reduced fees are astronomically high and should be closer to zero. He even accuses Wealthfront, one of the larger robo-advisers, of embodying the same \u201cWall Street\u201d mentality that many find reprehensible.</p> <p>So while investment professionals are staring at robo-advisers and wondering how they\u2019ll ever compete on cost, technology folks are looking at robo-advisers and wondering if they can be undercut further. I\u2019ve been saying this for a long time at this point, but\u00a0free investing is the new free checking. The cost of these services is going to approach and eventually reach zero.</p> <p>So What Should You Do?</p> <p>Enterprising Investor\u00a0is written for professional investors, so it\u2019s tempting to interpret the question above from a business perspective. What should you do if you want to stay competitive?</p> <p>The thing is that good business comes from good outcomes, so let\u2019s ask the question from a different vantage point. What should you do if you want to give your clients a good outcome?</p> <p>Blake\u2019s argument is really simple to encapsulate. Many robo-advisers compare their fees to the typical investment adviser\u2019s 1% and argue that they are fantastic. But that\u2019s not necessarily the right benchmark to use. All fees reduce investment return, so what would happen if you didn\u2019t pay any of them?</p> <p>Well, if you\u2019re able to save $5,000 a year for 50 years and invest it at a constant 6%, you\u2019d be richer.</p> <p>The more than $300,000 gap between a 1% annual fee and a .25% annual fee is striking, but so is the $125,000 gap between paying a seemingly nominal .25% and nothing. If you paid 1% a year in fees, you\u2019d have an account that is smaller by 28.5%, whereas if you paid just .25%, you\u2019d be behind by just\u00a0over 8%.</p> <p>Value after 50 Years of Saving $5,000 Annually </p> <p>And remember, that\u2019s for an account that receives regular contributions over time. For a lump sum investment, the gap is even larger.</p> <p>So like, why would you pay fees? The answer you have to give is because the fees are for services that add value, right? So the only question that matters is simple . . .</p> <p>Value Compared to What?</p> <p>Blake\u2019s post makes the point that many of the services that Wealthfront and other similar robo-advisers provide are of uncertain or questionable value, and he may well be right. It\u2019s awfully difficult to beat a Vanguard target date retirement fund on cost.</p> <p>But what is value here? What\u2019s the point of saving money? Managing someone\u2019s money well should be about maximizing their quality of life. It seems quite reductive to distill that down to the size of their bank account in retirement. Everybody\u00a0wants more money, but it\u2019s not the point of existence. It\u2019s just a means to buy the stuff you need or want.</p> <p>A mean-variance optimized portfolio, however it\u2019s delivered, is simply not the same as insight into what you will need and might want. It is also not as valuable. If you approach a client with a perfectly customized portfolio but fail to explain the role it will play in their life, they won\u2019t care very much. They might well become a client, but they will miss the point of the exercise and you will have failed both them and yourself.</p> <p>So don\u2019t neglect the conversations that are really important when you sit down with your clients. Don\u2019t forget to ask them about what they\u2019re doing to live a good life. You should be able to have discussions about the trade-off between spending money now to\u00a0be happier\u00a0and saving it for later in a context that is broader than an ending account balance.</p> <p>If you\u2019re willing and able to have those sorts of conversations with clients, then it\u2019ll be worth paying top dollar for your services.

And statistically speaking they\u2019re often right. Both public and private pensions and retirement savings plans around the world are in a sorry state, so there is little downside to counseling clients to save more money just in case these instruments won\u2019t be enough to support them. The worst-case scenario is that clients\u00a0will die without spending all their money.</p> <p>But it\u2019s time for the conversation between clients and advisers to level up. Though meeting the global retirement challenge is a daunting task, it\u2019s also a nuanced one. Reflexive cynicism is not just unhelpful, it\u2019s a missed opportunity.</p> <p>Think about it: If you are in the business of advising clients and don\u2019t have a working understanding of how their mosaic of private, employer-, and government-based programs works, can you even say you advise them? If you understand their situation but not the global ideal, how will you improve their outcomes?</p> <p>It\u2019s about more than just your clients, too. Whole countries need to come up with a coordinated approach to help ensure that their citizens don\u2019t end up impoverished in old age.</p> <p>If someone asks you what we can do as a society to confront the coming retirement crisis, how will you answer? With snark or considered thought? If it\u2019s the latter, I\u2019ve got a hot tip for you:</p> <p>Keep Reading for the Next Six\u00a0Minutes</p> <p>CFA Institute\u00a0thinks a lot about what a retirement plan should look like, and together with the consulting firm\u00a0Mercer,\u00a0developed a nice and easy 10-point list. Don\u2019t let that stop you from\u00a0reading the whole report, but the list is pretty comprehensive.</p> <p>If I were you, as I read through this, I\u2019d keep in mind that it\u2019s meant to be relevant at the global level. Every country has its own set of circumstances and the situation where you live might be very different from the lay of the land where I am. Here in the United States, the trustees of the Social Security program are not mincing words. Their\u00a02014 report\u00a0has, in its third sentence, the following quote:</p> <p>Neither Medicare nor Social Security can sustain projected long-run program costs in full under currently scheduled financing, and legislative changes are necessary to avoid disruptive consequences for beneficiaries and taxpayers.</p> <p>What kind of changes? Well, making sure we fulfill each of these 10\u00a0objectives is likely a great start:</p> <ol> <li>The government must establish\u00a0clear objectives for the whole retirement system, including the complementary roles of each pillar, and incorporate the provision of a minimum income to alleviate poverty among the aged population.</li> <li>A minimum level of funding should be made into a pension system for all workers with contributions by employers, employees, and the self-employed, as well as for those of working age who are receiving certain forms of income replacement. In effect, this means\u00a0every worker will have a retirement account\u00a0with an entitlement to future benefits.</li> <li>There should be\u00a0cost-effective and attractive default arrangements, both before and after retirement, for individuals who do not wish to make decisions.</li> <li>The overall administration and investment\u00a0costs of each pension arrangement should be disclosed\u00a0with some competition present within the system to encourage fair pricing.</li> <li>The\u00a0retirement system must have some flexibility\u00a0as individuals live in a range of personal and financial circumstances. This flexibility includes recognizing that retirement will occur at different ages and in different ways across the population.</li> <li>The\u00a0benefits provided from the system during retirement should have an income focus\u00a0but permit some capital payments or withdrawals during retirement, but without adversely affecting overall adequacy.</li> <li>Contributions (or accrued benefits) at the required minimum level must have immediate vesting and portability. These accrued benefits should only be accessible under certain conditions, such as retirement, death or permanent disability.</li> <li>The\u00a0government should provide taxation support\u00a0to the funded pension system in an equitable and sustainable way, thereby providing incentives for voluntary savings and compensating individuals for the lack of access to their pension savings.</li> <li>The\u00a0governance of pension plans should be independent\u00a0from the government and any employer control.</li> <li>The pension system should be subject to appropriate regulation\u00a0including prudential regulation of pension plans, communication requirements and some protection for pension scheme members.</li> </ol> <p>Policymakers, your work is cut out for you. I was actually surprised when I went through the various programs that impact me as a\u00a0US\u00a0citizen. I thought that the first objective would be one of the easier ones to fulfill \u2014\u00a0and was surprised to find myself totally wrong. For instance, the\u00a0stated mission of the Social Security Administration (SSA)\u00a0is to \u201cDeliver Social Security services that meet the changing needs of the public.\u201d That\u2019s way too vague to be helpful. What does it even mean?</p> <p>But at least now we have a framework to organize our concerns around where we used to have only frustration.

As with past sessions of the\u00a0Federal Open Market Committee, they will make a statement at the end. That statement will either move markets or bore them, but as a professional investor I will be waiting for exactly one thing: certainty about the path interest rates will take.</p> <p>You\u2019re supposed to laugh at that line. It\u2019s more likely I\u2019ll be tapped to be the new lead singer of One Direction than the Fed will tell us exactly what it\u2019s going to do. But I\u2019d settle for Yellen and company just narrowing the range of projections they\u2019re offering a little bit.</p> <p>I was privileged to be in attendance at the\u00a060th Annual Financial Analysts Seminar (FAS)\u00a0last week in Chicago, where\u00a0PIMCO\u2019s Marc Seidner\u00a0got straight to the point in his presentation: The dots aren\u2019t adding up. His first slide came from the Summary of Economic Projections of the most recently released Federal Open Market Committee meeting\u00a0minutes.\u00a0It\u2019s a bunch of dots. Here it is:</p> <p>Appropriate Pace of Policy Firming: Midpoint of Target Range or Target Level for the Federal Funds Rate </p> <p>Source:\u00a0The US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>According to Seidner, each dot shows where a voting member of the committee expects rates to be at the end of the calendar year in question.</p> <p>You See the Problem, Right?</p> <p>If this chart is being offered as an answer to the question, \u201cWhat do you guys think is going to happen with interest rates over the long term?\u201d the answer that we are being left with is \u201clol, I dunno.\u201d</p> <p>Just think about it. The span of projections given for the end of 2016 range from a little under 50 basis points all the way up to more than 2.75%. The US 10-year Treasury bond closed\u00a0Monday\u00a0yielding 2.23%, which means there is literally an entire 10-year Treasury bond\u2019s-worth of yield between the low and high end of the forecast range.</p> <p>It\u2019s convenient that the same degree of uncertainty doesn\u2019t exist about \u201clonger term\u201d interest rates: We are clearly being told to think of them as gravitating towards the 3.25%\u20134.25% range. But anybody who has spent time in investment markets can tell you that the long term can take a long time to materialize.</p> <p>The Fed seems to be saying the same thing.</p> <p>So to practitioners who are active in the market now, there\u2019s a straightforward question: What do you do? My colleague Jason Voss, CFA, has drawn attention to \u201cThe Little Worm That Is Destroying Capitalism,\u201d but we need to do more than stay away from companies with lazy capital budgeting processes.</p> <p>We Need an Interest Rate to Value Stuff With</p> <p>And we don\u2019t really have one. Or at least so it seems. Most investors should still be using discount rates that reflect what they expect to see over the lifetime of their investments, and I really hope that most people making active allocations have a time horizon of more than 18\u00a0months in mind. So perhaps it\u2019s worth examining your process a bit if you find yourself wondering when Janet Yellen is going to fix your discounted cash flow (DCF) model.</p> <p>But with that said, the market has a mind of its own. And this Federal Reserve Board\u2019s approach to normalizing policy may make it a more productive strategy than usual to pay attention to market-oriented forecasts instead of trying to read the tea leaves too closely. Indeed,\u00a0Jim Bianco of Bianco Research\u00a0argued in an earlier presentation that the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates until the hike is priced in. To make our lives simpler, he suggested that we all check the CME Group\u2019s\u00a0FedWatch\u00a0and go about our business. In case you\u2019re wondering, yesterday the near-month contract was trading with an implied 0% probability of a rate hike, albeit on close to no volume. The market right now has a 91% probability on a hike, but that may be static as trading in the contract comes to a close.</p> <p>But the importance of the Fed seemed straightforward to all who were in attendance at the FAS. At least five of the sessions focused on the path that this esteemed group of 12 technocrats would chart for the global economy. But at least a part of me wonders how much agency they have in the matter. Speaker Vivian Lau, formerly of Serengeti Asset Management, argued that 70%\u00a0of central banks around the world are easing right now. We (as the market) are focused on the one in Washington, DC, though.</p> <p>Is that because it\u2019s really the most important? Or just because it\u2019s the closest?</p> <p>I have to wonder if it\u2019s the latter. Though the phrase only appears once in the most\u00a0recent set of minutes, Fed watchers have stressed that the bank is likely to remain \u201cdata dependent\u201d in setting the future course of policy. What that means is anyone\u2019s guess. It sounds great to concentrate on the data. and clearly all analysts should have no problem with data-driven decision making.</p> <p>But one has to wonder if a data-driven decision might be a means of distracting the market from a more insidious truth: Perhaps the data are truly in control. Maybe, despite the implied power of the Fed, the Federal Open Market Committee is no more able to raise the prevailing rate of interest than I am able to levitate.</p> <p>We will see. One thing is for sure though: the quote of the FAS\u00a0goes to Holly Huffman of JP Morgan, who relayed her hope that the Fed would hike rates at the upcoming meeting.

How could they ever justify those massive fees?\u201d This response suggests\u00a0a lack of creativity \u2014 it\u2019s the sort of answer you get from investors who feel like they have figured everything out. The best way to continue a conversation is usually to ask probing questions about the lens they see the world through. If they\u2019ve constructed it thoughtfully, you might be able to pick up some great nuggets of wisdom.</p> <p>A second, less common answer is the polar opposite: \u201cI love \u2019em! The haters don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Hedge funds must be worth the fees, or how would they stay in business?\u201d This answer implies\u00a0a lack of basic intelligence. If you can say \u201cuncorrelated,\u201d \u201cresearch intensive,\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d enough times, you might be able to continue the conversation by pitching this sort of investor on\u00a0the hedge fund you\u2019ve recently decided to start.</p> <p>The third answer is the sort you only get at places like the CFA Institute\u00a0Financial Analysts Seminar (FAS). It\u2019s less quotable but much more nuanced.</p> <p>\u201cFor some sorts of strategies, I see some value,\u201d these respondents say. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a function of how the fund fits in the context of a portfolio.\u201d Even better responses note that \u201cIt really depends what the client wants to achieve.\u201d This conversation should largely take care of itself. It turns out that folks who are passionate about giving clients their preferred outcome are easy and engaging to talk to.</p> <p>So, what does this third sort of investor\u00a0really think about hedge funds?</p> <p>Relationship Status: It\u2019s Complicated</p> <p>The short answer is simple: Hedge funds are useful if their fees relate to value. The long answer is more complicated, because ascertaining the value that active managers provide has only gotten more difficult. A morning case discussion at FAS about\u00a0CALPERS\u2019s decision to leave hedge funds,\u00a0which was led by the excellent\u00a0Yiorgos Allayanis\u00a0of the Darden School of Business, weighed a host of issues and featured vehement (yet polite) arguments both in favor of hedge funds and against them. The case was far from decided by the time the 90-minute forum came to a close.</p> <p>We focused on a specific situation: Was it a good decision for CALPERS to move away from alternatives? We quickly honed in on the question of whether these managers had beaten their benchmarks. If you\u2019ve thought about\u00a0hedge fund benchmarking\u00a0at all, you know\u00a0there are many different aspects to consider. And the question is important! Hedge funds can be thought of as organizations that spring up to produce alpha, which is only possible to calculate in relation to a benchmark.</p> <p>It was fitting that the FAS ended with a presentation entitled \u201cThe Decline of Alpha,\u201d delivered by\u00a0Benjamin S. Appen, CFA, of Magnitude Capital and a discussion moderated by\u00a0Michael Falk, CFA, of Focus Consulting Group. Appen\u00a0acknowledged that it is possible to replicate the work of some hedge funds at a much lower cost via passive approaches to investing, but he stressed a belief that I tend to agree with: Passive investing is a sub-optimal strategy for expert investors. Not everybody is resourced to pursue investment opportunities, but it\u2019s worth it when\u00a0you have the capital, aptitude, and inclination.</p> <p>How Do You Do It?</p> <p>For starters, you\u2019ll need a benchmark \u2014 the bulk of Appen\u2019s presentation centered on a benchmarking strategy he and his colleagues have constructed and made available to the public at\u00a0betterbenchmarking.com.\u00a0They see it as a\u00a0streamlined approach to the exercise.</p> <p>The intellectual thrust of Appen\u2019s thinking is simple: Investors should evaluate an investment manager by separating returns attributable\u00a0to\u00a0readily available market factors (beta) from the returns that come from manager skill (alpha). But implementation is tricky. How do you get started?</p> <p>The method Appen laid out is somewhat \u201cquick and dirty.\u201d He takes the beta of a manager\u2019s track record with respect to equity, credit, and bond market risk, and then he generates a passive benchmark using those same risk exposures. This should make it clear whether a manager is adding value relative to the risks they are taking. A more detailed analysis, in which additional factors are considered, should\u00a0give a substantial amount of insight into the sources of a manager\u2019s returns \u2014 and whether they are truly worth paying a hefty \u201ctwo and twenty\u201d for.</p> <p>The exercise left me with two big takeaways. The first is that even though it\u2019s important to specify a manager\u2019s benchmark at the beginning of their mandate \u2014\u00a0and to evaluate them in the context of that benchmark \u2014\u00a0it probably is not enough. Especially when a manager has a broad mandate and lots of operational flexibility, it makes more sense to deconstruct their returns, breaking them down into specific contributing factors. If most of the returns are coming from a factor that can be accessed inexpensively, then there\u2019s little reason to pay substantial management fees to an intermediary.</p> <p>The second takeaway is perhaps less intuitive. If these methods of analysis are more widely applied, and the subset of managers that are not providing a value-added service go out of business, what happens to the managers who remain in the game? After all, there\u00a0are\u00a0strategies and firms producing returns not clearly\u00a0attributable to an easily accessible factor. Will their fees decrease as allocators of capital bring more scrutiny to the world of hedge funds?</p> <p>It seems that fees on hedge funds could\u00a0just as likely go up as down. In a world where there are fewer manufacturers of hedge fund products and those who stay in business are very closely observed, managers might\u00a0become more confident in asserting their value.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["hedge funds","manager selection"]},{"location":"blog/2015/08/25/can-the-financial-industry-help-save-the-environment/","title":"Can the Financial Industry Help Save the Environment?","text":"<p>This was first published on CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Would it surprise you to hear that one of the world\u2019s largest charities is a lot like Goldman Sachs? Why do you think that is?</p> <p>If you think it\u2019s because they both\u00a0don\u2019t put much emphasis on fixed-income trading these days, you probably need to take a vacation.</p> <p>If you\u2019re already thinking about the way that a financial toolkit could be applied to social problems, then I like you. That\u2019s what I did. After puzzling over it for a little bit, I called Mark Tercek, president and\u00a0CEO of the Nature Conservancy and author of\u00a0Nature\u2019s Fortune: How Business and Society Thrive by Investing in Nature, who was kind enough to answer my questions.</p> <p>Will Ortel: Mark, you followed a path that, I guess, is conventional. You went from a career in finance to a career in nonprofits. Was it as simple as:\u00a0you made money, and now you\u2019re a philanthropist? Or is there a knowledge transfer there that people might not expect? </p> <p>Mark Tercek:\u00a0Thanks for asking, Will. I worked at Goldman Sachs for 24 years. I had a really positive experience as an investment banker. It was great. As an investment banker, I was always one of those people who believed business and finance can be a force for good. I know not everybody agrees with that, and the financial crash is tough to reconcile for somebody who holds that point of view. But I was one of those true believers who believe that business could be a force for good.</p> <p>Later, maybe midway through my investment banking career, I became very interested in environmental issues, climate change in particular. And so, I got quite interested in that intersection: \u201cOK, if business could be a force for good,\u201d I asked myself, \u201ccould business and finance also be a force for progress in the environment and in addressing climate change?\u201d So, those became issues that were really important to me.</p> <p>In 2005, I decided to leave Goldman Sachs \u2014 I was a partner \u2014 and go into the environmental field. Although, I admit I didn\u2019t have a very fully developed plan. I talked to my boss at that time, Hank Paulson, about it. He didn\u2019t think my plan was very good, and he had a different idea. \u201cMark,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should stay at Goldman Sachs and build an environmental effort for the firm.\u201d</p> <p>So, Hank talked me into doing that and\u00a0I did it. It really accelerated my learning on environmental matters broadly and how business and finance can make a positive difference. That was the last job I had at Goldman Sachs after a very mainstream career. And my last position was building this environmental effort. I was really enthused about it.</p> <p>When the Nature Conservancy job opened up, the headhunter called me. The headhunter was really looking for other ideas I might have, but I used the opportunity to nominate myself. And lo and behold, I ultimately got the job. And so, that\u2019s how I got here. I arrived as a former investment banker who cares about environmental issues and believes that business and finance skills can really be instrumental.</p> <p>When you talk about Goldman Sachs playing in an environmental market, that implies that there is a spectrum of involvement. Goldman Sachs obviously is for-profit, and your experience there is relevant to your work at the Nature Conservancy, which is a mission-driven nonprofit. What\u2019s the difference between the sorts of projects that you get involved in at the Nature Conservancy and the sorts of projects that you got involved in at Goldman Sachs? </p> <p>It\u2019s really been interesting and fun for me. And I always encourage people that\u00a0if they\u2019re in the position to do so, pursue a second career in the social sector. When I transitioned from Goldman to the Nature Conservancy, which we call TNC for short, in some respect, it didn\u2019t feel like such an abrupt transition because, just like Goldman Sachs, TNC is a global organization. We\u2019re kind of organized,\u00a0structured, and staffed like a professional service firm. We hire really bright entrepreneurial, problem-solving go-getters deployed all around the world. And at the Nature Conservancy, we do deals. We buy things. We act like a merchant banker. We represent governments and companies on transactions.</p> <p>But here,\u00a0nature is our client. That\u2019s the bottom line. That\u2019s the big difference. And so, I think it makes our work more challenging. In hindsight, business looks easy to me because you have such clear metrics and measures \u2014\u00a0cash flow, IRR, market share \u2014 these kinds of things. So, you can really know (with some confidence) how you\u2019re doing and which strategies work better than others.</p> <p>In our world here in\u00a0the environmental problem-solving area, it\u2019s a bit murkier than that. At the Nature Conservancy, our mission is to save the lands and waters that life depends on. So, that almost sounds grandiose, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do everyday. A lot of the work we\u2019re doing has never been done before. So, we\u2019ve got to be smarter about how we measure our progress. We\u2019ve got to use science in a very sophisticated way to know whether we\u2019re deploying our resources, capital, talent, et cetera in the best way.</p> <p>But, in a very general sense, the Nature Conservancy is not that different from a well-run Wall Street firm trying to solve problems. It\u2019s just that nature is our client. When we think about deals and when we think about raising cash flow for deals, it\u2019s a lot like looking at a straight up financial deal. What kinds of cash flows can one structure? What\u2019s the risk that goes with that? What are the right sources of capital to optimally finance an opportunity?</p> <p>**Walk us through what that looks like in evaluating an opportunity. We were exchanging emails about Morro Bay. Could you go into that? **</p> <p>Yes. Morro Bay is a great example. So, until very recently, the Nature Conservancy financed most of its projects with donor capital or government grants. We get some government grants but not really that much. Mostly we rely on donor capital to do our projects, and that\u2019s great. I mean it\u2019s extraordinary how generous our supporters are. They\u2019re generous, passionate people. The Nature Conservancy is a really big organization, and that\u2019s due to the generosity of our supporters.</p> <p>But if you think about that donor capital, you could liken it to investor equity. Financial analysts, Wall Street types, know that if you\u2019re going to be efficient from a financial perspective, you want to use that precious equity very carefully and strategically. And when possible, you want to lever that up with other capital, lower cost capital.</p> <p>Now, the Nature Conservancy, we\u2019re a good credit. But we\u2019ve got to be careful about borrowing to do projects because we\u2019re nonprofit. We shouldn\u2019t be levering up on our own balance sheet very frequently because we\u2019ve got to be careful about how we\u2019ll pay that capital back.</p> <p>And so as a result, broadly speaking, most of our projects have been equity financed or donor financed. And one is the one you mentioned, Morro Bay. It\u2019s a great story. I wrote about it in my book,\u00a0Nature\u2019s Fortune.</p> <p>Essentially, the Nature Conservancy and some other really good environmental organizations had ideas about how we could improve fishing practices in the Morro Bay, which is in Central California. People have been fishing there for generations. Until recently, the technique that had been used is bottom trawling, which means dragging kind of a rake \u2014 it\u2019s a big rake \u2014 across the seabed to gather fish. And although that does gather fish, it ruins the seabed. It ruins the fishery and pulls up a lot of other sea life that the fishermen weren\u2019t seeking. And so, of course, to the environmentalist, that is really suboptimal.</p> <p>So, we went to the fishing community, and we argued and cajoled and tried to talk people into doing business on a different basis. As you might imagine, environmentalists and fishermen don\u2019t speak the same language. So, we didn\u2019t get very far. The other environmentalists we were working with kind of concluded this wasn\u2019t going to work, and we were all about to give up. At the last minute, the Nature Conservancy had a really cool idea. This is before my time here. So, I\u2019m not bragging about anything I did, but I found this to be an inspiring story.</p> <p>Rather than give up, the Nature Conservancy bought some vessels and some fishing licenses, and we joined the fishing community \u2014\u00a0and that really freaked people out. They said, \u201cOh, my God. Now these environmentalists are here.\u201d But we got to know one another. And we leased our vessels to fishermen who were willing to fish on what we thought were sustainable bases, and we showed the local community that it was possible. Then it was kind of complicated. But, for example, one of the outcomes was we used hook-and-line fishing techniques rather than bottom trawling. And hook-and-line brought the fish up alive and that made them eligible for the very lucrative high-value sushi market, and it turned out that was a more lucrative practice of fishing.</p> <p>So, anyway, fast forward, we became friends with the other fishermen. We put in place regulations, regulatory processes to protect the fishery. People have gravitated now toward much better practices, and it\u2019s really a great story. And you could call it a complete success, really a great success.</p> <p>From a financial perspective, though, it would be hard for us to do that often because, again, we financed those purchases, those vessels and licenses, with donor capital, our equity. And that\u2019s a very precious financial resource, and we never have enough of it.</p> <p>So now, fast forward to today. Our know-how and\u00a0our fishing sciences have improved a lot. So, we think we know how to similarly intervene at fisheries all around the world and change practices. But again a financial intervention is required. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t look exactly the same. Maybe we wouldn\u2019t buy vessels. But on one basis or another, we have to induce the fishing community to fish differently, to fish less, even sometimes stop fishing for a while.\u00a0Our idea today is we can pay people to do that because these fishing communities sometimes have capital costs that they need to serve; sometimes they\u2019re very poor people and fishing is their livelihood. So, they need an alternative livelihood and we need capital to address that.</p> <p>But our reasoning is that we could have a capital structure that has some equity, but we could also borrow funds that would pay to change the fishing practices. We believe that the fishery could recover and then reopen, and we could get our fair share of the proceeds of the reopened fishery, and in that manner, pay off our borrowed funds, earn a return to the equity investors, and now we might have a sustainable and scalable source of finance for those kinds of interventions.</p> <p>That\u2019s a big deal because\u00a0in the old model we can only do a little bit of it, and we don\u2019t think the pace will be fast enough to address the world fishing challenges right now. But if we should do it on a financially sustainable basis that provides returns in the way I just outlined, then we could raise a lot of capital and\u00a0do it at scale, and we\u2019re trying very hard to do that now.</p> <p>So, that\u2019s an example of bringing modern financial practices to the philanthropic sector\u00a0\u2014 in this case, fisheries conservation\u00a0\u2014 and that\u2019s very new stuff. And it might sound kind of boring and conventional to your sophisticated financial audience, but it\u2019s very new in our space. And it\u2019s daring, too, because we don\u2019t have a track record here. We have this one deal financed with all equity. So, we\u2019d be doing something new. It\u2019s akin to opening a new financial market. We\u2019re very excited about this.</p> <p>It sounds like you\u2019re talking about impact investing. Am I using the right word there?</p> <p>Yes, impact capital is the word there. Impact investing, you hear a lot about it right now. It\u2019s kind of a loose term and people mean different things by\u00a0it. What I think most people would agree with, though, is that impact capital is investor-provided capital to supplement donor capital to drive the social sector, and in our conversation now, let\u2019s limit that to the environmental and conservation sector.</p> <p>We\u2019re very interested, just like I described in that fishery example, in\u00a0raising capital to lever those donor funds up And so, we\u2019re interested in doing conservation deals with predictable cash flows that will allow us to build smart capital structures. Now, in some cases, the cash flows are very predictable, so that would allow for a very levered capital structure and\u00a0that could be prudent. In other cases, we have some very daring ideas, so that would call for a much less levered capital structure, but it still could draw on investor capital rather than donor capital.We think this is a way to get a whole bunch of new money and new people into the game.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ll add for the Nature Conservancy, we\u2019re especially interested in investor capital that will be provided to us at below-market terms. We\u2019ll be able to do some deals at market, but we can do even more below market. And then you say, why would someone do that? Why would a financial investor provide you dollars at better than market terms? Here\u2019s the answer.\u00a0There are a lot of folks out there who are in a financial position and interested in supporting the Nature Conservancy\u2019s good work, but they\u2019re not ready yet to be donors. It takes a lot of work, more than you might think, to be a donor. Hands-on financial people have made a lot money. They want to be just as hands-on when it comes to giving their capital away, and they\u2019re right now too busy in their careers making capital. So, they\u2019re not ready to be donors.</p> <p>I argue to folks like that, instead of giving us money, lend us money or invest in deals. Here are the cash flows. We\u2019ve got a real track record here, so we can reliably put together cash flows. Some are riskier than others. So, we\u2019ll structure the capital appropriately, and it\u2019s a\u00a0way for people to get in the game, help the Nature Conservancy achieve its important mission, and get to know us better. All those folks can feel good about making the world a better place, they\u2019ll get their capital back and the return, and later down the road, when they\u2019re ready, they can be donors, but it can really escalate our ability to make things happen now.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking about something you said earlier when describing the capital you have from donors: \u201cWe never have enough.\u201d That sounds perfectly right. But\u00a0I wonder how \u2014 if you were to try to figure out how much money you need \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s possible. I guess you could buy every forest on the planet, but short of that, is there something that looks like a market cap or something like that for conservation opportunities or is trying to put that level of precision on it just kind of stupid.</p> <p>Well, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid because you want prospective investors to know that this is a big market. It\u2019s likely to be a liquid market, and therefore, it\u2019s worth your time now in the early start-up stages to get in the game and get engaged.</p> <p>I remember in my Wall Street career, a lot of new markets started. For example, I was around \u2014 I\u2019m old \u2014 when the high-yield market started, and when it began, people called it the junk bond market. It wasn\u2019t called the high-yield market then. It was small. It wasn\u2019t very liquid. It was a risky place. But everybody \u2014\u00a0the big institutions, the banks, the investor institutions, and the capital users \u2014\u00a0mostly concluded this is likely to go forward and work.</p> <p>So, it\u2019s worth our while to do the work now even though it\u2019s a small market. But it\u2019s going to be a big market someday. And so we want people to know that\u2019s likely to be the case for conservation impact capital too. Smart people have put together estimates, such as $250 billion. So, this could be an enormous market.</p> <p>I have to hasten to add, though, that estimate is very speculative because just take my fishery example. There are, in fact, very few examples of what I\u2019ve described. There\u2019s our [Morro Bay] deal, and there are\u00a0a couple of other deals. They are very small and an enormous amount of care went into them, so it\u2019s going to be up to people like us. You could think of us as almost like the banker or the middleman. It\u2019s going to be up to the fishing communities and the investors.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s very reasonable to think that one success will lead to another, and I can point to a bunch of other areas in nature conservation where that\u2019s the scale, but it\u2019s the very early days.\u00a0But I think it\u2019s reasonable for institutions to think this could be very, very big.</p> <p>As a result, for example, JPMorgan is an important partner of ours right now. We have this entity called\u00a0NatureVest. JPMorgan has been a very generous philanthropic supporter. They made a generous grant to allow us to step up. That\u2019s a hard thing for a nonprofit to do: Raise some money to hire some people to do a new thing.</p> <p>JPMorgan allowed us to do that. So, we hired some young versions of people who look like me, men and women who have financial skills and are interested in the environment and like to put their financial know-how to work for nature. JPMorgan is also collaborating with us, lending us people, deal people, investor people, and coverage people. What are JPMorgan motives? Well, they want to be a good corporate citizen. They care about the environment. They\u2019d like to help us.</p> <p>Those are the kinds of philanthropic concerns, but they also anticipate that there is every reason to think this impact capital market will be big, and so that would be their additional payoff. They\u2019re one of the early movers here. So, that\u2019s how I think smart people are thinking about this opportunity, but it\u2019s the early days.</p> <p>Although it may be the early days in the private market that we\u2019re talking about, our audience of professional investors is primarily concerned with the public markets. Are there opportunities to think green and gain an edge in public markets?</p> <p>Well, I\u2019d say this: I think \u2014\u00a0I hope \u2014\u00a0investors are paying close attention to the companies they invest in and how they\u2019re thinking about various environmentalists. It\u2019s always a little hard to tell. I\u2019m always encouraging CEOs, and I pitch this right to the CEO level because you really need the CEO\u2019s engagement. Most companies, in my view, are crazy if they\u2019re not paying very close attention to environmental challenges because over the next five years, it\u2019s inevitable to me that their success is going to depend in large part on how they address those challenges. A\u00a0lot of them agree, and they work with us to get better at those kinds of opportunities.</p> <p>But others often say, when we talk to our analyst in quarterly earnings calls, that no one seems to care about our environmental initiatives, and it surprises me when I hear that. I hope your audience isn\u2019t thinking that way because if you think of\u00a0\u2014 for example, off the top of my head \u2014\u00a0any beverage company that\u2019s not paying very close attention to its sources of water, it\u2019s crazy, right?</p> <p>Because the climate is changing, there\u2019s enormous stress on water. There\u2019s enormous demand on water. And companies, whether they are beverage companies or food companies, need to be well aware of those risks and have strategies to protect themselves. So for investors, my first point would be to pay attention to these environmental issues. Obviously, you can see they\u2019re not going away. They\u2019re only going to become more difficult, and most businesses are going to be right at the front edge of dealing with that.</p> <p>I think the investors who are early players in these impact capital deals are going to gain an edge. It\u2019s like any of these in new markets. The first one \u2014 they\u2019re not cookie cutter. You can\u2019t just buy. It\u2019s not going to be just like buying a public offering with a rating and you don\u2019t have to do a lot of work. The early deals are going to require work, but that\u2019s going to allow people to do some good deals. It\u2019s also going to make them very, very smart about some of the most important trends the world is going to have to address over the years ahead.</p> <p>For those of you who\u2019ve heard this and are interested in learning more, Mark\u2019s book,\u00a0Nature\u2019s Fortune, is an excellent read, and the CFA Institute Research Foundation\u00a0has an e-book on the topic,\u00a0Environmental Markets, A New Asset Class.</p> <p>**Mark, thank you so much for joining us on this call.

Arguably everything, in fact.</p> <p>Last time I talked about the US Federal Reserve, I suggested that the extreme level of uncertainty about long-term interest rates effectively breaks capitalism.</p> <p>Surely we can agree that\u2019s kind of a big deal.</p> <p>But with this decision, there were two things hanging in the balance that are perhaps more important than the global capitalist system.</p> <p>The first: a nerve wracking bet between yours truly and the excellent\u00a0Paul McCaffrey, the complexity of which we hadn\u2019t fully anticipated. Amid a context of sharply rallying bonds and equities, we couldn\u2019t break a $10 bill to properly settle the wager. Chaos happens when trades don\u2019t settle. All we can hope is that somebody walks by with two $5s to avert any potential systemic implications.</p> <p>The second: the fate of the English language itself. It has always been hard to love markets if you also love words and clear expression. Some of the jargon dreamed up by investment professionals can seem like it was designed to troll any humanities major who might be hanging around.\u00a0This Google search\u00a0amply documents the breadth of the issue up until now. The number of alphabet soup abbreviations \u2014\u00a0ZIRP,\u00a0IOER, and\u00a0TDF, for example \u2014 has long compounded at a rate far greater than most investors will ever experience.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a new piece of lingo\u00a0on the horizon that crosses the line:</p> <p>Negative Interest Rates</p> <p>It\u2019s time to stop saying this. Forever. And it\u2019s not a small or merely rhetorical\u00a0point.</p> <p>Sure, \u201cnegative interest rates\u201d doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue in the same way as theta burn, convexity, or some other acceptable piece of jargon. And it\u2019s never a good idea to use three words when two will do. But that\u2019s not why this turn of phrase\u00a0is insidious.</p> <p>It\u2019s insidious because it has the potential to make you think wrong. Paying somebody to use your money for a while and being paid to lend your money for a while are fundamentally different transactions to engage in. And there are at least a few folks on the Fed\u2019s board who believe\u00a0it\u2019s possible investors are going to wind up doing the former pretty soon.</p> <p>Just look at the dot plot:</p> <p>See those two dots in the updated version below 0.00? They mean that there are up to\u00a0two voting members of the Fed who predict banks will be paying each other -0.25% for overnight borrowings at the end of 2015 and 2016.</p> <p>That\u2019s an Unterest Rate, Not an Interest Rate</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just a matter of style. I\u2019m calling it something different so that we can collectively realize it will actually be something different.</p> <p>To illustrate that, I\u2019ll interview myself a little bit:</p> <ul> <li>Will an unterest rate environment persist for a long time?\u00a0I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s never happened before.</li> <li>What happens to risk appetites in an unterest rate environment?\u00a0I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s never happened before.</li> <li>How can retirees safely generate income in an unterest rate environment?\u00a0I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s never happened before.</li> </ul> <p>So stay vigilant.

This site is meant as an archive, so I've included it here. More current stuff on financial journalism is available here. I've since written a lot about the attention economy, which this was an ineloquent stab at describing. This post was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Apple and the news media are not on good terms right now. The company\u2019s newly released iOS 9 contains an ad-blocking feature that many journalists\u00a0see as a potential death knell for the industry.</p> <p>It\u2019s rational to be worried. Journalists exist in a competitive sphere that is in many ways the worst of all worlds. The professionals in the field are constantly on the hook for creating content, and it\u2019s not enough to just turn out one good story and then milk it for a long time. Content needs to be fresh every day, and reporting is a labor intensive endeavor, particularly when it comes to breaking news. So the amount of work that needs to be done just to stay relevant is daunting.</p> <p>And almost nobody wants to pay for that work. The clearing price for information has dropped to \u201cfree,\u201d which presents some business model challenges. It turns out one of the requirements for doing the work above is a live human being, and keeping one of them alive takes money.</p> <p>Historically, that money has come from a mix of newsstand sales, subscriptions, and advertising. The first two have been gutted by the transition from print to digital, while the third has long been under threat. Is Apple\u2019s move to include ad blocking by default a harbinger of things to come? Will it undermine one of the news media\u2019s remaining financial foundations and spell the end of journalism? Are the ranks of the unemployed about to become drastically more literate?</p> <p>**I\u2019m Not Worried ** If you take a step back from the discussion about revenue models and monetization to focus on the core function that journalism and journalists provide society, you arrive at a short but important list:</p> <ol> <li>Transmitting information</li> <li>Uncovering new information</li> </ol> <p>For some segments of journalistic activity, there is an excellent argument that this is a form of public service. Certainly it is critically important that the public is kept informed about what\u2019s occurring in the halls of power and crises that could affect our daily lives. It\u2019s obvious why many hear that journalism is under threat and connect that immediately to a significant risk to civil society.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not going to happen. Here\u2019s why: A side effect of fulfilling the roles outlined above is that journalists gain a significant amount of influence over time. Influence is a tough thing to buy. You can purchase a spot on my Twitter feed or inside my\u00a0Economist, but the odds that I am going to ignore you or even become annoyed are significant.</p> <p>If you just publish something good, however, I (and others) will want to read it, and it will travel around the world without anyone spending a penny on it. And your influence will grow.</p> <p>So If You Want to Grow Your Influence, Buy a Journalism Organization</p> <p>Obviously that\u2019s not a route available to everyone, but it doesn\u2019t need to be. Plenty of people have money and want influence. A subset of those people might be able to offer a forever home to one of the beleaguered news organizations that fear its business model is abandoning it.</p> <p>And I\u2019m not suggesting everything is fine because, say, Jiffy Lube would be happy to sponsor\u00a0The New York Times. There\u2019s a clear pattern that develops as people grow wealthier: They start trying to leave a lasting impression. This has given rise to a number of great things that aren\u2019t explained by pure commercial intent: the modern museum and the giving pledge, among them.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ve essentially argued here that the journalism industry doesn\u2019t need to worry about going extinct because there exists a coterie of friendly billionaires who would be more than happy to take it in as a pet. That does not feel good. And I\u2019m not predicting that billionaires will cascade into newspapers and buy them out.</p> <p>But I do think that they will have a market-defining effect well into the future. In other words, I think you\u2019d be foolish to ignore the influence they can have in the valuation of any given media company. In M&amp;A speak, they are what\u2019s called a \u201cstrategic\u201d buyer, which means their idiosyncratic answer to the question \u201cdoes this purchase make sense?\u201d will have as much to do with the pricing of a property as the dollars and cents it creates.</p> <p>And the net effect of that is that there will be money around to fund journalism for a long time, even if it doesn\u2019t come from the newsstand, subscriptions, or advertising. The allure of enhanced influence will be enough to keep capital drifting into the news media for quite some time to come.</p> <p>And Some of That Capital Won\u2019t Be Seeking Influence Alone</p> <p>Think like an entrepreneur for a second: What happens to the value of a new revenue model when an old one comes under threat?</p> <p>Whether or not the new model is any good in real life, it will attract attention in roughly exponential proportion to any revenue it can create. For new ventures, attention has a way of transforming into influence. That influence might translate into just the sort of tailwind that a new venture needs.</p> <p>Now is not an objectively fantastic time to go out and start a journalism business, but ventures that have been successful in monetizing without relying on ads are likely to be viewed as suddenly more valuable.</p> <p>New ventures with novel approaches to monetization are also likely to continue beating down the doors of Sand Hill venture capitalists. Some of them will get funded. Few of them will work. But everyone will expect that going in.</p> <p>And journalism will stay alive. And individual journalists who have been successful at informing and provoking reaction over the years will find their content still has value that someone (even if they\u2019re not the ultimate consumer) is willing to pay for.</p> <p>In a perfect world, these challenges would not be such a huge factor. But even in our imperfect world, there are people willing to fund projects for reasons that aren\u2019t purely financial, as well as people who love to fund risky projects in uncertain times. Journalism\u00a0will be fine.</p> <p>If you're not upset after reading this post, you'll probably hate my newsletter.</p>","tags":["retractions","financial journalism","attention economy"]},{"location":"blog/2015/10/22/the-impact-of-six-nobel-laureates-on-finance/","title":"The Impact of Six Nobel Laureates on Finance","text":"<p>It\u2019s been 10 days since the\u00a0Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences\u00a0to\u00a0Angus Deaton\u00a0of Princeton University \u201cfor his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare.\u201d</p> <p>Press reports emphasized Deaton\u2019s research into inequality\u00a0and its troubling growth in recent years. \u201cI think inequality has gone past the point where it\u2019s helping us all get rich, and it\u2019s really becoming a serious threat,\u201d Deaton said.

There is a camp of thoughtful people who have never bought the \u201cbull\u201d market. Many of them haven\u2019t turned in great performance numbers over the past few years, but it\u2019s not like the criticisms they offer have withered on the vine. True growth is hard to come by. Financial engineering is everywhere.</p> <p>And we\u2019re still in emergency mode. Weird stuff happens when tools\u00a0meant for emergencies \u2014 like a fire extinguisher or that credit card you gave your kid \u2014 are used constantly for seven years.</p> <p>Of course, this all means that not much is new. Let\u2019s unpack the data to see whether the party is\u00a0likely to continue. But before I offer any analysis, it\u2019s time for a disclaimer: There is a narrative here, but it\u2019s mine. You need to build yours. Be critical, question my assumptions, and let me know what you think in the comments below.</p> <p>Let\u2019s Get Started: </p> <p>Chart (BAML): More investors view the current global economy as being in the \"late\" phase of the cycle - pic.twitter.com/ArQ2krleja</p>\u2014 SoberLook.com (@SoberLook) October 20, 2015 <p>I began one of these in March by\u00a0asking if I was the only one starting to feel like it\u2019s pretty darn late in the business cycle. Markets were higher then, and nobody wrote in to make me feel less lonely.</p> <p>Today it looks like four out of 10 professional investors would agree. This could be interpreted to mean that the fight between bull and bear is about to get a lot fairer, but take care and look at how wrong those investors were back in 2011 and 2012 before getting too confident either way.</p> <p>Actually this is pretty amazing. $4.5tn worth of buybacks since 2004 vs. $158bn of cumulative flows into US funds: pic.twitter.com/QPcXClwQF2</p>\u2014 Tracy Alloway (@tracyalloway) October 19, 2015 <p>There\u2019s good reason to be pessimistic though. People talk about how the market is financially engineered, but it can be tough to tell if we\u2019re talking about the amount of engineering necessary to build a paper airplane or a Boeing 777. Turns out it\u2019s the latter.</p> <p>Companies have spent 2,848% more money buying their own stocks than investors have moved into the stock market since 2004.</p> <p>I guess this means that each dollar that did flow in received a significantly greater participation in the market, but it strains credulity to call something with that characteristic a robust bull market.</p> <p>Chart: On a \"harmonized\" basis US is in deflation; price declines worse than in the Eurozone - pic.twitter.com/5uOcwPmDYO</p>\u2014 SoberLook.com (@SoberLook) October 20, 2015 <p>Or this characteristic. I spent some time at a\u00a0Euromoney Inflation-Linked Productsconference at the tail end of last month, and I met a number of very sharp portfolio managers who have had a tough go of things in the last few years. At the beginning of this stimulus cycle, it seemed obvious to many that inflation was going to take off and protecting your earnings against it was imperative.</p> <p>Now it seems many believe that inflation protection is about as useful as\u00a0cloud insurance. I don\u2019t agree \u2014 look for a great article from\u00a0Dave Allison, CFA, CIPM,\u00a0in the next week or so\u00a0explaining why in some detail \u2014 but this does fall firmly into the camp of things that aren\u2019t good news.</p> <p>You have to dig a little to see why. These \u201charmonized\u201d indices come from the\u00a0European Central Bank (ECB), and they\u2019re designed for comparisons across countries. This has some differences from the US\u00a0CPI, perhaps most notably in that it incorporates prices from rural areas.</p> <p>Whatever the methodological differences are, you have to take it seriously when an apples-to-apples comparison from a reputable statistical agency shows the United States\u2019 deflationary spiral is worse than Europe\u2019s. Perhaps our rural areas are an economic drag similar to Europe\u2019s southern countries?</p> <p>Shelter inflation continues to lead the way, accelerated to new cycle high of +3.2% yoy in September pic.twitter.com/m49WVOHgbx</p>\u2014 Matthew B (@boes_) October 15, 2015 <p>It could dishearten you further to recall that one of the few spots where we do see sustained inflation is housing. Rising on its own, the cost of shelter doesn\u2019t directly indicate a growing economy . . . just supply/demand imbalances in the places that people want to live. And as a result, the cost of sleeping indoors in these places is rising. That\u2019s not expansion, that\u2019s a price hike.</p> <p>This is actually the point in this essay where I start to get more upbeat though. Bear with me.</p> <p>Remember that time we built way too many homes and tons of people bought too many of them and it almost ruined everything? Remember\u00a0NINJA (no income, no job, no assets) loans\u00a0and\u00a0this character? It turns out all that might leave a scar. Multi-family housing starts (often built by investors) are back around pre-crisis levels, but single-family housing starts are a country mile away.</p> <p>2.

The traditional way of thinking has long been that as slack dissipates from the economy, it translates into inflation. But so far translating anything into inflation has been about as easy as translating the\u00a0Financial Analysts Journal\u00a0into Akkadian. Good luck if you want to give it a try, you know?</p> <p>With that said, there is important optimistic logic here. It goes like this:</p> <ol> <li>People with jobs mostly choose to live indoors.</li> <li>It would be cheaper for many of them to own than to rent.</li> <li>Some of those people will buy houses.</li> <li>Big ticket purchases!</li> <li>You need furniture and stuff for a house.</li> <li>Consumer spending!</li> </ol> <p>At least that\u2019s the theory. This logic is really just okay, since it\u2019s not drawn from a diversity of premises. But it is intuitive that after many years of renting and unemployment, recently much more employed American consumers are ready to treat themselves. And, of course, in economics we call the subset of this logic that relates inflation and unemployment the\u00a0Phillips Curve.</p> <p>For the past few years, the Phillips Curve has been something of an enigma. Nobody has seen it in a while \u2014\u00a0like\u00a0interest rates. But it does make sense that incremental tightening in the labor markets will eventually flow through to higher spending and eventually inflation. At least that\u2019s the hope.</p> <p>Now shifting gears to China, I can remember way back to a time (this summer) when financial news channels sounded an awful lot like that\u00a0three-minute montage of Donald Trump saying \u201cChina\u201d.</p> <p>Now it appears that trend has abated, at least in terms of news flow.</p> <p>But maybe it should be accelerating.\u00a0$500 billion has left China so far this year.\u00a0You can call it \u201chot money\u201d or whatever else you want, but it stings.</p> <p>ZH chart showing that China is selling large amounts of US Treasuries via Belgium... pic.twitter.com/lyNzfdjRxs</p>\u2014 Ron Rimkus, CFA (@RonRimkus) October 20, 2015 <p>And is almost certainly related to some of the stealthy selling of\u00a0Treasuries my colleague Ron Rimkus, CFA, noted on our pipeline call recently (and tweeted about later).

I couldn\u2019t help myself either.</p> <p>First, you have to just take a second and think about what this company was to the world at the time. Today, it\u2019s hard to remember Enron as anything but a classic example of hubris and fraud. But\u00a0the market didn\u2019t always know that.</p> <p>\u201cAlready an established leader in the natural gas industry, Enron is moving rapidly \u2014 through revolutionary communications systems and interfaces \u2014 to become the world\u2019s preeminent energy and commodities marketer, high-density Internet distributor, and distributed energy leader. We believe that Enron should be compared to leading global companies like GE, Citigroup, Nokia, Microsoft, and Intel, and that its valuation reflects this eminence.\u201d [All emphasis mine.]</p> <p>And take care to note the trajectory that the market saw. Frauds can seem like the hottest ticket around. Remember: People called up Bernie Madoff asking to invest with him and he turned a lot of them down. In the market\u2019s perception, Enron was on fire:</p> <p>\u201c$98 PRICE TARGET. Our Attractive rating and 12-month price target reflect Enron\u2019s highly successful existing businesses, customer relationships and contractual agreements; its advanced online systems and business models; and its valuation relative to potential financial results (based on both a conservative DCF and comparables analysis).\u201d</p> <p>Just a quick tangent here. When I was a kid, my dad taught me the meaning of the term \u201cconservative basis\u201d as it\u2019s commonly used on Wall Street.</p> <p>I caught on quick. He asked me how much soda I wanted, and I said that on a conservative basis I\u2019d need seven 12 packs.</p> <p>So\u00a0I don\u2019t want to go back in and list all the aspects that are just ironically amusing here. But there are a couple of things that we should look at and remind ourselves to be wary of in the future. Here is a company whose long-term vision is more blindly ambitious than anything I can imagine.</p> <p>\u201cAll told, with consistent earnings and cash flow from the Transportation business, market dominance in the Wholesale and Retail sectors, and projected hyper-growth in its Broadband business, Enron\u2019s long-term vision is to possess unbeatable scale and scope in every business and region in which it operates.\u201d</p> <p>And look how the arguments for Enron rest on fundamentally true assumptions that are just being thought of in the wrong timeframe.</p> <p>\u201cBandwidth Technology and Applications \u2014 The Future of Enron? By now, we have all heard of the benefits afforded Internet users through assorted bandwidth technology. Enron truly believes that this technology will fundamentally alter how business (and life in general) will be conducted in the future. Currently building out a worldwide bandwidth network, Enron is focused on having the ability not only to transmit high-content data but also to trade bandwidth as a commodity between customers. While unsupportable at this time, Enron sees a future (sooner rather than later) where earnings from bandwidth could surpass the combined earnings from the rest of the company.\u201d</p> <p>Something else\u00a0to be wary of: buying stock in a trading operation. \u201cThese guys are great traders\u201d is a firm foundation upon which to build magical thinking. Imagine how such a sentence could make you feel inclined to worry a lot less about the downside.</p> <p>\u201cShort-Term Pricing and Long-Term Demand Projections Favor Enron. We consider Enron (and other wholesale energy companies) to be \u2018long volatility.\u2019 In essence, high prices and price volatility are Enron\u2019s friends due to the company\u2019 s growing marketing, trading, and retail (energy management) operations. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2001, with prices decreasing from their current highs and high volatility continuing throughout the year. For the long term, we envision demand for natural gas increasing significantly faster than in the past, with domestic demand rising approximately 5\u20138 Tcf over the coming decade. Of course, given Enron\u2019s flexibility and the trading culture it has established, we would expect the company to go \u2018short\u2019 volatility at some point, in advance, perhaps, of a dampening in the volatility of the gas and power markets.\u201d</p> <p>And the first risk in the \u201crisks\u201d section of this outlook spells out something that feels like it should have been a much bigger red flag. This is a paragraph that must prompt an analyst to wonder how much they are paying for growth at minimum. Think about the many logical premises that you need to grant in order to write this passage and then walk away recommending the stock.</p> <p>\u201cWholesale\u2019s Performance Overshadows Everything Else Enron Does. With the Wholesale Energy segment consistently generating 85%-plus of the company\u2019s revenues and earnings \u2014 and a large portion being driven off of unpredictable commodity pricing volatility \u2014 we are concerned that building and maintaining a meaningful forecasting model will become virtually impossible. As with most wholesale energy companies, Enron provides analysts with little information beyond end-of-reporting-period bottom-line figures with regard to its respective marketing and trading operations. In the financial world, these types of inherently volatile and unpredictable earnings streams have historically garnered lower valuation multiples due to their lack of visibility and predictability.\u201d</p> <p>At minimum, there seems to be no consideration for Wall Street\u2019s history of valuing irregular profit streams. Maybe everything is fine at the company and revenues are just uniquely hard to predict. Wouldn\u2019t you think that would create a valuation impairment?</p> <p>There are some passages in between the one above and the one below that are seriously amusing.\u00a0But this one will make you a better analyst.</p> <p>I present to you (without comment) how the team came up with their $98 estimate and \u201cAttractive rating.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor our own purposes, and because the company is seeking significant growth in several nascent businesses that are currently under development (most specifically bandwidth intermediation and content delivery, but also the Enron Net Works business area developing within the Wholesale Energy segment), we are relying primarily on two methodologies, DCF and DCF-based terminal IBITDA multiple, to value Enron. Using projections through 2005, as well as a terminal/perpetual growth rate of 4.5% and a discount rate of close to 7% (based on our calculation of Enron\u2019s weighted average cost of capital or WACC), we arrive at a present value of around $89 per share. This discount rate figure was determined using both a tax-adjusted cost of equity and cost of debt calculation, drawing on an approximate corporate tax rate and a long-term risk free rate of 5.65% (30-year government bond rate quoted on January 24, 2001). Using a 12x terminal IBITDA multiple through our second valuation method, we arrive at a present value of approximately $108 per share. Splitting the difference between these valuation techniques, we arrive at our 12- month price objective for the shares of $98 as well as our Attractive rating.\u201d</p> <p>And this a just\u00a0a sample of all the interesting data I found.

And, of course, people are starting to use it to make investments.</p> <p>But the AI that makes art and music can\u2019t make investments. It\u2019s a safe bet there\u2019s at least one person who is world class at all three. And that\u2019s the heart of one of the largest questions in the world right now: Is it possible to create an AI that can match a human at a broad range of cognitive tasks?</p> <p>To be clear, this is a challenge. There\u2019s something special about human intelligence that we\u2019re not quite able to put our fingers on yet. When Garry Kasparov played chess against IBM\u2019s Deep Blue supercomputer, it was estimated that the computer was checking 200 million positions a second while Kasparov was checking five. Kasparov won their first tournament.</p> <p>How would that be possible if there wasn\u2019t some sort of secret sauce inside the human brain? But technology is progressing at a furious pace, and a growing group of developers are harnessing this progress to search for the secret recipe. With that in mind, we decided to ask the readers of CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief for their opinion.</p> <p>And, boy, did opinions vary. They should, because this is both a controversial and critical issue. That technological progress is a component of economic growth is hardly a revelation. But creating a human-quality intelligence that is native to the silicon environment of a server farm, never sleeps, and is networked to the entire world has the potential to substantially revise everything we know about how technology moves forward. Take a second and think about how such an innovation would affect your ability to find work. Just watch a relatively primitive AI play the popular smartphone game 2048.</p> <p>It\u2019s logical to think you could find a job doing manual labor. But Luke Muehlhauser, the former executive director of the Machine Research Institute (MIRI), says no way: \u201cRobots will be better than humans at manual labor, too.\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible to create an artificial intelligence as smart as a human? </p> <p>If you\u2019re scared, there is some good news. A plurality (35%) of the 772 respondents think achieving human level intelligence is impossible.</p> <p>It well may be. After all, creating music and feeling emotion are entirely different things. I\u2019m writing this while listening to \u201cfocus enhancing\u201d music from brain.fm, and even though the music does do a good job of keeping me on task, it\u2019s tough to think the machine felt anything while creating it.</p> <p>No matter how far technology advances, it may just be impossible to replicate the feeling of wonder, awe, and infinite smallness that a human being experiences while staring up at the night sky.</p> <p>But technology is getting pretty good at faking it. Last year, a poem written by an AI was accepted to The Archive, a literary magazine at Duke University.</p> <p>Given that, it\u2019s understandable why 11% of respondents believe that such an intelligence already exists. Writing a poem is still a ways away from the sort of AI depicted in Ex Machina, but it\u2019s definitely the sort of thing that people are surprised computers can do.</p> <p>That element of surprise is actually one of the more interesting elements about forecasting this trend. When a technology works, we immediately take it for granted. But the last time you flew on an airplane, a computer was doing most of the piloting!</p> <p>And let\u2019s not forget that in 1895 Lord Kelvin famously said that \u201cHeavier than air flying machines are impossible.\u201d Speaking on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, NASA\u2019s then-deputy administrator, Frederick Gregory, declared Kelvin to have been \u201cslightly in error\u201c.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t able to confirm whether he dropped the microphone afterwards. But that underscores a serious point: Declaring a technological innovation impossible is a form of hubris that invites mockery. Scientist and author Arthur C. Clarke offered a great turn of phrase: \u201cIf an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible he is almost certainly right, but if he says that it is impossible he is very probably wrong.\u201d</p> <p>So I wouldn\u2019t advise shorting technological progress. And the balance of respondents didn\u2019t. Instead, they offered divergent forecasts for when an artificial intelligence would be developed. The second largest group of respondents (32%) believed it would happen by 2045, followed by 12% who thought it would happen by 2100. 11% believed that it would be possible, but the breakthrough would not come this century.</p> <p>The median prediction in a survey of forecasts is 2042. There are plenty of reasons to take this with a grain of salt, particularly because predicting things is very hard. But if this has piqued your interest and if you\u2019d like to learn more, I recommend first reading this excellent explainer of the state of the field at the moment. If then you think that this might be a trend worth investing in, take a look at the technology from the perspective of a venture capitalist.</p> <p>And if reading this post has got you worried about a dystopic future, read this comic and chill out a bit.

And now seems to be the perfect time.</p> <p>If you\u2019re not a CFA Institute member yet, no big deal. We\u2019d love for you to join or, barring that, pick up a copy on Amazon. Or just keep reading. Because for the balance of this post, I\u2019m going to try and round up a few things that are objectively true at the moment and highly relevant.</p> <p>1. Spreads are widening, and people are noticing.</p> <p>Specifically,\u00a0Enterprising Investor\u00a0colleague\u00a0Martin Fridson, CFA. In an\u00a0interview with Bloomberg, he points out that the 7.39% spread investors in high-yield bonds were demanding over Treasuries during the month ending 8 January points to a 44% chance of recession. Stripping out the uniformly shellacked commodities sector, he still finds a market-derived probability of 20%. Though he goes on to note that he is inclined towards optimism, those new to these developments would do well to read the 2 December 2015 note from colleague\u00a0David Schawel, CFA. Those not so new to the story will likely already know that\u00a0the daily spread has widened since Marty highlighted\u00a0the issue.</p> <p>2. If you\u2019re looking for inflation expectations, you can find them in the toilet.</p> <p>The\u00a05-year, 5-year forward inflation expectation rate is at the lowest level ever, apart from the 2008\u20132009 recession. But what does that really mean? Though this spread is widely used as an indicator of inflation, it\u2019s really just the output of a formula. The implications of that are\u00a0well detailed here.\u00a0In fact,\u00a0it might be a fantastic time to buy protection against rising inflation.\u00a0But it\u2019s worth remembering that even if this series doesn\u2019t axiomatically mean inflation expectations are falling, its sustained decline certainly doesn\u2019t mean that expectations are rising.</p> <p>3. Real growth expectations are right next to them.</p> <p>The Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model is suggesting that\u00a0GDP growth will come in at an annualized rate of .8%\u00a0for the fourth quarter of 2015.\u00a0Forecasters surveyed by the Wall Street Journal\u00a0have divergent expectations, but they are almost uniformly higher.\u00a0A paper analyzing the accuracy of GDPNow\u00a0found that it had particular trouble forecasting private inventories and exports. Though likely incorporated into the current reading already, a\u00a0sharply higher dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015\u00a0and\u00a0flattening private inventories through the third quarter of 2015\u00a0don\u2019t seem to indicate that the model is erring on the high end.</p> <p>4. Not many US\u00a0stocks have hit\u00a0new 52-week highs.</p> <p>Duh, right? After all, stock indices themselves are well below their peaks, so you wouldn\u2019t expect a large number of the equities that compose them to be trading near record levels. But here\u2019s the thing: The number of stocks making new highs was falling even as headline indices were rising. You can see what I\u2019m getting at by taking a look at the\u00a0NYSE High-Low Index, which \u2014 you guessed it\u00a0\u2014 tracks that relationship. Check out\u00a0this tutorial\u00a0for a quick primer on how to peer inside of this interplay\u00a0and how to use the tool to make decisions. You should be able to tell right away that the market\u2019s breadth sure isn\u2019t minty.</p> <p>5. Nobody seems to want oil.</p> <p>I spoke with a very sharp friend in the oil business on Tuesday night who\u00a0shared a cutting observation: \u201cAt $40 oil, people were confident. At $30, oil they\u2019re terrified.\u201d The evidence would appear to support a sense of doom. Here are\u00a0five charts that purport to \u201cdefinitively prove oil is toast.\u201d\u00a0That analysis was conducted before the Tuesday inventory report, which noted that \u201cinventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what will come of this. All I can say is that if you\u2019re considering taking down some of that inventory for your personal account, I\u2019d advise against accepting\u00a0physical delivery. One of the few moments of levity in the last six months of oil news came when Bloomberg\u2019s Tracy Alloway\u00a0did just that\u00a0and reported on the absurdity of the process.</p> <p>With those five points in mind, it\u2019s time to focus longer term.

It literally took us out of the cold.</p> <p>It powered the first industrial revolution, which fueled countless advances that have made the world altogether more livable. And today\u00a0hundreds of thousands of people make a difficult living pulling it out of the ground, and millions more precede them.</p> <p>Of course, that is rapidly changing. In West Virginia, once the heart of coal country,\u00a0less than half of all civilian adults are employed. The decline of the coal industry is not just an American phenomenon. Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces in northeastern China,\u00a0once the country\u2019s industrial heartland largely because of their abundant coal resources,\u00a0have long since fallen behind\u00a0and are now\u00a0among China\u2019s slowest growing.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that hard to figure out why. Over the past five years, the price of coal has decreased sharply. The Dow Jones US Coal Index trades at its lowest levels ever. The\u00a0industry is in a tough spot.</p> <p>And that\u2019s before you even consider carbon emissions. Bloomberg ran an excellent story entitled \u201c2014 Was the Hottest Year on Record.\u201d A year later, they followed that up with a similarly titled piece,\u00a0\u201c2015 Was the Hottest Year on Record.\u201d</p> <p>I hope you can see where I\u2019m going with this. It is not controversial to say that the earth is warming. The only question is: What happens next? There are physical, transition, and liability risks to get familiar with, and investors should not waste time.</p> <p>In his excellent curation of the best resources to help investors with this, my colleague Usman Hayat, CFA, observed that despite all the headlines climate change generates, \u201ccuriously there is little if any coverage of the phenomenon in traditional investment textbooks.\u201d Time to bone up.</p> <p>There\u2019s no question that there is an intersection. Arch Coal, long one of the largest coal producers, just filed for bankruptcy.</p> <p>A driving reason for that: There is a strong case that we won\u2019t be burning coal forever. It\u2019s cheap, but dirty. It provided 41% of the world\u2019s electricity in 2013, but to understate the case, new coal projects are unpopular. In the United States, coal-burning power plants account for about 39% of the electricity generated but 77% of the sector\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p>What compounds the problem for the coal industry is that continuing to use coal is a choice the world makes. And given the environmental costs associated with that choice, the world might be inclined to change its mind. So we decided to ask CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief readers how many years they thought it would take for coal to be phased out as an energy source. There wasn\u2019t much of a consensus among our 730 respondents.</p> <p>How many years until coal is phased out as an energy source?</p> <p></p> <p>At least 42% of our readers project they will be dead before it happens. I got that number on the back of an envelope, but I think it\u2019s not far from the truth. The average global life expectancy was 71 years in 2013, so if one were to assume our readers are all 20 years old, \u201cIt\u2019ll take more than 50 years\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be dead before it happens\u201d are basically the same statement.</p> <p>And they might be right. Coal power plants keep being built. It takes a lot of assuming to think that coal will go away soon.</p> <p>Or perhaps not. As my colleague Svi Rosov, PhD, CFA,\u00a0noted on Twitter, that sure looks like an S curve in adoption. These are widely thought to indicate a mature if saturated market. Technological disruption is always possible.</p> <p>And it\u2019s tough to handicap, but there is a compelling argument that that\u2019s happening. The\u00a0ranks of solar workers in the United States now outnumber coal miners. There has been discussion of a cheaper-than-coal fusion reactor. That may sound like the stuff of science fiction now, but many realities of daily life today would have seemed just as farfetched 20 years.</p> <p>And if the rumor that the White House wants to impose a $10-a-barrel fee on oil to fund green transportation proposals has any validity, the act of politics I mentioned in my earlier tweet is at least somewhat more likely.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p> <p>This post was first published by CFA Institute.</p>","tags":["environmental markets","energy markets"]},{"location":"blog/2016/02/26/how-to-get-smarter/","title":"How to Get Smarter","text":"<p>It\u2019s simple: Lever yourself with technology.</p> <p>It\u2019s not controversial to suggest that computers (and the software that they run) have changed a lot about the way that we live. Mainstream science documentaries are already discussing the eventual emergence of a human-machine meld as an inevitability. Whether that presently far-fetched idea comes to pass or not, there can be no disputing that AI is for real.</p> <p>Any observer is bound to wonder: Will I be left behind? A widely cited estimate suggests that 47% of total US employment is at risk of being replaced by technology. Think like a portfolio manager: Isn\u2019t that the sort of risk you should hedge?</p> <p>You can, but hedging well is a function of effort not security selection. I\u2019m putting my money where my mouth is here: The organizing premise that CFA Institute rests on is that you can always be a better analyst. So, I\u2019m a bit biased towards continuous improvement. If you want to take this with a grain of salt, fair enough.</p> <p>Your Loss</p> <p>We polled CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief readers about their comfort with technology, and the plurality (62%) of the 583 participants responded, \u201cComfortable \u2014 I\u2019m a skilled user, but there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>What is your comfort level with technology?</p> <p></p> <p>So, what steps can one take to turn \u201ca lot\u201d into \u201ca little\u201d? The first step might be as simple as learning a few keyboard shortcuts. If, like many, you\u2019re a daily user of Microsoft Excel, there\u2019s no excuse not to invest a little bit of time getting faster.</p> <p>I spent a number of years as a ski racer and coach, and I can tell you with authority that the difference between an advanced and intermediate skier is whether they are able to lean out over the fall line while turning. Using Excel without a mouse is exactly the same sort of bright-line separator. Especially if you would have answered \u201cof course\u201d to this poll, aspiring towards mouse-free spreadsheeting is an excellent interim goal.</p> <p>Fortunately, there are resources to help you. An excellent software package called KeyRocket integrates nicely into Microsoft Office on Windows computers and shows you a little notification every time you perform an operation that could have been done more quickly with a hotkey. It also has a Chrome extension. I\u2019m not aware of a similar program for Macs, but HotkeyEVE gives a similar introduction to the many shortcuts that can speed your navigation through the (highly hotkey-friendly) Mac operating system. And here\u2019s a quick explanation if you\u2019re mystified by the notion that anyone would rip F1 off of their keyboard.</p> <p>Just as leaning out over the fall line is an introduction to a world of fast turns, deep powder, and a better life in general, adding hotkeys into your routine will leave you wondering how you ever got anything done without them. You\u2019ll also quickly realize that they\u2019re something of a minimum. As you start performing the same operations as before more quickly, you\u2019ll start to wonder: What about new ones?</p> <p>Goodbye, Deus Ex Appina</p> <p>It used to be the case that if you wanted your computer to do something that it couldn\u2019t do already, you had to wait around for someone else to build an app for you.</p> <p>That is no longer a thing.</p> <p>The cost and difficulty of creating your own simple apps has plummeted in recent years. And we\u2019ll get to that. But a host of new technologies bring a great deal of the power that can be harnessed by writing simple applications into the hands of the average user, no code required. Perhaps the most widely known of these is a service called If This, Then That. It\u2019s IFTTT for short.</p> <p>Its integrations run the gamut from turning the lights on when you get home\u00a0to\u00a0triggering alerts based on movements in the financial markets\u00a0and even ordering mulled wine on Christmas. Presumably, you could set up an automatic light switch rave whenever one of the companies in your portfolio beats earnings or rallies sharply.</p> <p>But that\u2019s actually pretty picayune compared to the tools you can use to get some actual analysis done. You\u2019re doubtless aware that data from services like Bloomberg and Reuters can be pulled easily into Excel. The St. Louis Fed even has its own tool to pipe in the data from its excellent FRED service\u00a0alongside the other data streams.</p> <p>But You Can Go Further</p> <p>A new service called Blockspring allows you to pull in data from a substantial and growing number of web services. So, you can build custom news searches, overlay a sentiment analysis, and have your spreadsheet text you if people are saying nice things about you on the internet. A state of hyper-awareness is only a few alerts away.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget that you can also pipe in data from Quandl, Data.gov, and pretty much any website. But, by the time you get around to doing stuff like that, it\u2019s probably time to start thinking about writing actual code.</p> <p>Which programming language should you learn? It\u2019s a daunting question, but it doesn\u2019t need to be. For one thing, learning to program is a lot like learning a foreign language. At first, you will be expressing yourself with roughly the eloquence of a five-year-old. And you\u2019ll be able to do about as much. But eventually, you\u2019ll be able to access a whole set of conversations that made no sense beforehand. And even if you find out later that you\u2019d prefer to have a different set of conversations, you\u2019ll still have learned something.</p> <p>That\u2019s how you get smarter.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p> <p>\ufeff\ufeffThis post was originally published by CFA Institute.</p>","tags":["technology","investment research"]},{"location":"blog/2016/02/27/34-charts-this-time-is-different/","title":"34 Charts: This Time is Different","text":"<p>This was one of the more widely read pieces I ever wrote for the Enterprising Investor at CFA Institute.</p> <p>\u201cThis time is different\u201d \u2014\u00a0I might include that in the title of everything I publish from now on.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never be wrong, which is an appealing proposition.

If you assume CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief readers\u00a0are right that 2016 GDP growth in China will come in below 6%, strip out the nearly 50% of growth that comes from investment and then consider how rapidly prices are changing in the economic zones where there is organic growth.

The Shanghai Composite sits right around 3,000 today, which is quite a long way down from the 5,000 it was at three quarters ago. There are big questions to ponder. Think like a Chinese policymaker. With a slowing domestic economy and significant evidence of capital flight, do you focus on a stable currency or a stable monetary policy?</p> <p>That question has, to put it mildly, some implications for the investment community.</p> <p>It\u2019s also helpful to note that, on at least one quantitative basis, systemic risk in China is the highest of any country in the world. That\u2019s not much of a surprise to those who are paying attention. More than half of the CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief readers who we polled think that the economy will turn in less than 6% growth this year.</p> <p>Investors looking for additional context have been studying the most recent report to the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), but it is also helpful to\u00a0examine the fundamental differences that China has in terms of market structure. Some things do not look at all like they do elsewhere. For instance, credit analysis requires an investor to be, to some degree, an analyst of state policy.</p> <p>I was eager to get some perspective on what\u2019s happening and what to expect, so I enlisted the help of Gordon Chang, a peripatetic and knowledgeable observer of the region\u00a0and\u00a0a return guest to the Enterprising Investor.\u00a0Chang is the author of two books\u00a0and\u00a0also writes for Forbes and World Affairs.</p> <p>The format of what follows is relatively simple: The charts and questions come from me, and the answers come from him. Let\u2019s jump in.</p> <p>Chinese Equity Markets Have Grown Meaningfully in Market Capitalization</p> <p></p> <p>Enterprising Investor: Looking just at the growth of China\u2019s market capitalization, it\u2019s an impressive track record. How would the Communist Party of China like us to see this?</p> <p>Gordon Chang:\u00a0They\u2019d like you to look at the market as really being modern. Really as a rival to New York, and in some ways it is. For instance, before the collapse of the Chinese stock market last year, the Chinese stock index futures market was the largest in the world. The volume there is very, very big.</p> <p>The problem is that although you have a lot of money sloshing around China, those markets are not modern. We saw that as the Communist Party tried to rescue stock prices beginning the first week of July. They directly intervened. They criminalized a lot of forms of trading. They prevented the institutions from selling. They directly bought up stock through the so-called \u201cNational Team.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the fact that these stock markets are now about 25 years old, they really haven\u2019t reformed very much. There\u2019s been relatively little progress because the government right now is just dominating the markets. China no longer has functioning equity markets.</p> <p>As GDP Growth Slows </p> <p>We\u2019ve all been told not to trust China\u2019s GDP figures. Can you take us inside the statistics a little bit?</p> <p>The National Bureau of Statistics reported 6.9% growth for 2015, but very few people now actually believe that. There\u2019s a consensus forming around 4.0%. For instance, you have the Conference Board reporting 3.7% growth for last year.</p> <p>Capital Economics in London is saying 4.3%. Although, you can make a case for 1% or 2%, especially when you look at electricity consumption, which is still by far the most reliable indicator of Chinese economic activity, and when you look at price data. For instance, for last year, when they were reporting 6.9% real, they were also reporting 6.4% nominal.</p> <p>China\u2019s officially in deflationary territory. Q4 was really ugly, because Q4, nominal was 5.8% and real was 6.8%. This is a situation going downward. It doesn\u2019t really matter what China\u2019s growth rate is, whether it\u2019s 6.9% or 1%. The point right now is that Chinese leaders cannot change the downward trajectory. China\u2019s growth has been slowing fast. It\u2019s going to continue to do that.</p> <p>Eventually, it\u2019s going to go into contraction, and that\u2019s a problem because China has accumulated all this debt in order to create growth. In some way, it\u2019s got to pay this debt back. In one way or another, it\u2019s got to retire these obligations. This means that China\u2019s headed towards a debt crisis.</p> <p>While Debt Grows Meaningfully</p> <p></p> <p>It sounds great, 50% year-on-year growth,\u00a0until you realize we\u2019re measuring debt. And again, that\u2019s just as reported by the government, which we\u2019re taught to suspect fudges numbers from time to time. What could the true number be?</p> <p>Their debt, we don\u2019t really know what it is. For instance, McKinsey Global Institute said, in the middle of 2014, that it was 282% debt to GDP. Soros, in Davos in January, said 350%. Some people are talking 400%, which I think is actually closer to the mark.</p> <p>This is not a good story. There\u2019s an enormous amount of debt out there. A lot has been stuffed away in corners. We don\u2019t have a really good view of what it is. When you combine that with stalling growth, it means that there\u2019s got to be an adjustment, and that adjustment\u2019s probably going to look like 1929.</p> <p>Are Domestic Borrowers Preparing for a Devaluation? </p> <p>It seems like Chinese borrowers are maybe anticipating a currency move. If they were caught offsides with renminbi revenues and dollar debts, that would be really bad. Is that what\u2019s going on here?</p> <p>Last year, there was $1 trillion of net capital outflow, according to Bloomberg. Other people say a little bit less. A large part of that net capital outflow were Chinese borrowers switching out of US dollar debt into renminbi debt, because they are concerned about the exposure. They don\u2019t want to get caught on the wrong side of a declining renminbi, which is actually happening right now.</p> <p>Of course, the central bank is trying to support it, but eventually they\u2019re going to have to relent. They will have to capitulate. When they capitulate, it\u2019s going to probably be at the last moment, because they\u2019re going to hold on for as long as they can do so. When they can no longer do so, we\u2019re going to see a run out of this currency.</p> <p>Trading Volumes and Margin Balances Have Dropped Appreciably </p> <p>What\u2019s going on with the plummeting volume\u00a0and margin balances?</p> <p>First of all, you\u2019ve got to remember that one thing that\u2019s happened since the first week of July, and that is the central government, through various state entities\u00a0\u2014 the so\u2011called National Team \u2014\u00a0has been buying up stock. When the National Team buys out stock, it doesn\u2019t trade them, so you\u2019re going to have declining volume.</p> <p>Also, this is a partial re-nationalization of state enterprises, so this is bad on two counts. That\u2019s why you have volume declining. One thing that\u2019s fascinating: Bloomberg reported that volume of the stock index futures market\u00a0\u2014 which was the world\u2019s largest prior to the mid\u2011June collapse\u00a0\u2014 volume in the July-August-September time frame declined 99%.</p> <p>This is an indication of how tough the central government has been, how determined it\u2019s been to support stock prices. They\u2019re going to do everything they possibly can to prevent the market values from tanking, but when they do that, they\u2019re killing volume, and China no longer has a functioning stock market right now. It just doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s the government playing.</p> <p>What we see in terms of changes in the Shanghai Composite, when they go up, it\u2019s mostly the government. When they go down, it\u2019s when the government isn\u2019t looking.</p> <p>Zooming Out, You Wonder: What Currency Volatility?</p> <p></p> <p>The renminbi is this big specter that looms over any thought an investor might have regarding China. Recent currency moves have not been that big, if you look at them on a long time horizon.</p> <p>There has been talk about further devaluation, but what range of values are we really talking about here?</p> <p>The central bank has said that they\u2019re not going to have a big one-time devaluation, which might make sense. They will continue to support it until they no longer have dollars and foreign currency to do so, which means that when it adjusts, it\u2019s going to adjust sharp. It\u2019s going to be sudden, and there\u2019s no bottom to this market.</p> <p>They will hold on until the very last moment. They can prevent large downward movements to the renminbi, but they really cannot, I think, do this for that much longer. There\u2019s too much money coming out of the country.</p> <p>One of the things that\u2019s even worse: There was, in February, a much smaller decline in the foreign exchange reserves compared to January, when it was $99.5 billion. It declined to under $30, about $28 billion in February. That\u2019s because basically no one\u2019s allowed to remit money out of the country. Or, if they do so, it\u2019s under very tight circumstances.</p> <p>China\u2019s essentially re-imposed very strict capital controls. A lot of these controls are off the books, so they\u2019re not official. This works for a little while, but the problem is: Who\u2019s going to put their money into a country when they may not be able to get it out?</p> <p>The issue for China is going to be inward flows. Eventually those inward flows will stop, because of what they\u2019re doing to prevent the outward flows.</p> <p>Forex Reserves Seem to Have Been Spent to Support the Currency </p> <p>But Are They Just Replacing Outward Capital Flows?</p> <p></p> <p>The reported declines in foreign exchange reserves I think have been minimized. They give us a number. We can back check it, but it\u2019s hard to do that.</p> <p>Also, the one thing they\u2019ve been doing is they\u2019ve been engaging in forward transactions to hide the decline in the foreign reserves. They\u2019re going with these derivatives. This is what Brazil did in 2013. It never ends well. Yes, China has a lot of firepower, but it\u2019s declining fast.</p> <p>Also, some of the funds in the reserves may not be liquid, so, therefore, they may not be available for defense of the currency. There\u2019s a big black box there, and the global financial community just relies on the numbers that China has been giving us. I don\u2019t know if we can actually do that.</p> <p>Chaos Is Becoming Consensus</p> <p></p> <p>This is definitely news. We were joking at the beginning of this. We titled our last conversation, \u201cIs China Going Off the Rails?\u201d At the time, that was not a question many were asking. Recently The New York Times ran a headline saying the answer was yes: \u201cA New Economic Era for China as They Go Off the Rails.\u201d Are enough people talking enough about this? Are too many?</p> <p>I think that the global financial community understands that there are real problems in China, and they didn\u2019t understand this, let\u2019s say, eight or nine months ago.</p> <p>For instance, you go back to August of 2015. You have relatively unimportant news coming out of the Chinese manufacturing sector causing big drops in equity markets in Asia, Europe, and the United States. For instance, we had six days in August when we lost $2.1 trillion in value because of inconsequential things happening in China.</p> <p>Now, when you have bad news out of China, it doesn\u2019t necessarily affect global markets. I think we\u2019re becoming inured to that. Also, I think the global financial community, although it understands there are problems there, I don\u2019t think they understand the dimension of the problems.</p> <p>They see the Chinese government sort of rescuing things, but they don\u2019t really look behind how that\u2019s occurring and the sustainability of Beijing\u2019s moves. Beijing\u2019s moves: They can do this for a year or two, but the problem is that as they prevent the adjustment, the underlying imbalances are becoming bigger.</p> <p>As the underlying imbalances become bigger, the inevitable adjustment has to be severe. Chinese leaders are continuing to do this stuff until they no longer have the ability to do that. When they no longer have the ability to do it, their economy will go into free fall. I don\u2019t think the global financial community understands that.</p> <p>China Seems to Be Moving from One Sort of Outlier to Another </p> <p>How much of this is just demographics? ** At the moment, they have a massive working-age population supporting a relatively small number of retirees, but World Bank estimates have us right at the inflection point where it heads the other way. By 2050, China will have more retirees than the rest of the world and perhaps a less dynamic population and economy, by extension.**</p> <p>**A view that\u2019s forming is that really this is the beginning of the end for them. Is it the case that there are a couple of reforms that they can enact, burn off some bad debt, and get back to business, or are we witnessing a structural decline? ** There are structural economic reforms that if they were implemented could save China, but the problem is that those reforms are not possible within the context of the political system that China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, will not change. The answer is that we\u2019re not going to see the reforms that are necessary.</p> <p>Indeed, at Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s work report at the ongoing National People\u2019s Congress meeting, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re prioritizing growth over reform. They\u2019ve basically given up on reform. Yes, they talk about it, but they\u2019re not implementing it.</p> <p>That means that what we\u2019re seeing is essentially a long, slow decline. Without reform, they aren\u2019t going to be able to make the changes that are absolutely necessary. There\u2019s just no political will to do that.</p> <p>In fact, if we look at the changes in the economy since Xi Jinping became China\u2019s general party secretary in November 2012, he\u2019s taken China backwards. He\u2019s recombining already large-state enterprises back into monopolies.</p> <p>We\u2019re seeing the partial re-nationalization of the Chinese economy as more and more state ownership of state enterprises. More state money going to favored market participants. Foreign companies are losing market share, because they\u2019re being attacked by the state.</p> <p>These are all things that are regressive, so Deng Xiaoping\u2019s policy of reform and opening up is over. We\u2019re going back to a Maoist-inspired economy. That may sound a little harsh, but indeed what Xi Jinping is doing is very reminiscent of what we saw in the 1950s. This is a bad story for China.</p> <p>Yes, they can stave off problems while they have more and more state control, but eventually this whole thing just fails, as it did before.</p> <p>**You say the recipe is similar to Mao\u2019s in terms of centralizing control. What are some other major points of concordance between what Xi Jinping has been doing and the 1950s period in China? **</p> <p>When we look at it, I think the most telling thing is the re-creation of state monopolies, which is absolutely the wrong way to go. China created growth in the 1990s when they went the other way, when they were breaking up state monopolies, allowing state enterprises to compete with each other.</p> <p>Now, we\u2019re about a year and a half, two years into a reversal process. That means there\u2019s more and more of these recombinations. That means less and less competition. That can\u2019t be good for the competitiveness of these enterprises except for competitiveness at home.</p> <p>Of course, the bigger they get with no competitors, yes, they will be able to maximize profits. Only in China, though. Around the world, they\u2019re going to get beaten, because they are losing those qualities of competitiveness that are absolutely necessary to compete in global markets.</p> <p>Growth in Energy Consumption Has Stalled </p> <p>Analysts love to look at electricity usage in China, under a theory that you can\u2019t really trust GDP that much.</p> <p>For 2015, electricity consumption increased by 0.5%. Generally speaking, GDP growth has been about 85% of the growth of electricity. We\u2019re talking a pretty low GDP number.</p> <p>Of course, electricity\u2019s only one indicator, but there are others that corroborate, essentially, a no\u2011growth environment. If we go back to the last downturn at the end of the 1990s, a lot of people were saying electricity was no longer so indicative. Afterwards, after that downturn passed, people went back and realized electricity was indeed still the best indicator.</p> <p>Now, people are saying there\u2019s a move away from manufacturing to services, so therefore electricity is not as important as it once was. There may be a little bit of truth in that, but nonetheless, when you look at all the range of indicators that we have, electricity, I believe, is still number one.</p> <p>We\u2019re seeing so many other signs of minimal growth that I think electricity still is telling us what the Chinese economy is doing.</p> <p>And Rail Volume Has Fallen </p> <p>How relevant is rail freight volume?</p> <p>Rail freight was one of the three indicators that Premier Li Keqiang mentioned as the things that he looked at when he was a provincial party secretary. This is going back to 2007, when he was talking to the American ambassador.</p> <p>This was in a WikiLeaks cable. The three things he mentioned were electricity consumption, rail freight volume, and bank lending. Rail freight volume is something we can measure. It\u2019s something that is easy to verify, and we see it going down.</p> <p>People say, \u201cWell, more stuff is being moved by truck.\u201d Maybe, but nonetheless, the decline in rail freight volume is especially troubling because it is so large, these percentage decreases. I think that, essentially, we\u2019re looking, again, at another factor showing basically the contraction of the manufacturing sector.</p> <p>I think the manufacturing sector is contracting. It did last year, 2% or 3%, maybe a little bit more. There may be an increase in services, but not nearly enough to make up for the decline in manufacturing, especially because the central government devastated the financial services industry beginning in the middle of July, when they tried to rescue stock prices.</p> <p>A lot of things are going in the wrong direction right now. Not everything, but a lot of them.</p> <p>We\u2019ll get to the stuff that\u2019s going in the right direction in a little bit.</p> <p>That\u2019s a one\u2011minute discussion.</p> <p>It seemed a bit that way when I started digging through the data. What is going in the right direction?</p> <p>There are more retail sales, certainly not as much as the central government statistics indicate. The problem with the increase in consumption, I think, is that it\u2019s basically a derivative of growth elsewhere, especially growth of investment.</p> <p>Investment growth is completely unsustainable. It\u2019s anti\u2011reform. When investment growth starts to choke even more than it is now, I think it\u2019s going to take consumption with it. What we\u2019re seeing from consumer products companies is some growth, but not very much.</p> <p>A lot of people like to report, \u201cOh, say, well, the growth of volume over Alibaba\u2019s platforms and JD.com, online retailers,\u201d but they\u2019re really taking away sales from bricks and mortar. When you start to look at companies that sell across both platforms, online and offline, there really is unimpressive growth or even some contraction in the earnings of these companies related to China.</p> <p>There\u2019s some positive story there, but it\u2019s not enough to counteract the collapse of manufacturing.</p> <p>The Export Picture Is Grim</p> <p></p> <p>Should we be taking the recent export numbers as an accurate signal?</p> <p>There might be a little bit of distortion related to Chinese New Year, but when you combine January and February numbers for both imports and exports, they\u2019re both down deep in the double digits. That eliminates entirely the New Year effect.</p> <p>Trade is just disastrous. You notice that Premier Li Keqiang, in his work report, didn\u2019t have a target for trade this year. That\u2019s the first time, I think, ever. For the last four years, they have not met their target.</p> <p>Last year, their target was 6% growth in exports and imports combined. It actually came out down 8%. They missed by 14 percentage points. It\u2019s not getting any better, as we saw from January and February.</p> <p>This is a real indication of problems in the Chinese economy. The import number, I think, is the more important one because that reflects manufacturing demand, and it also reflects consumer demand. You have some pretty atrocious\u2011looking numbers coming out of imports and exports.</p> <p>Certainly, just looking at this chart, even if you take the 12\u2011month average, it\u2019s negative. There\u2019s a very senior person on Bloomberg saying, \u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not that bad. It\u2019s only down 4%\u00a0on average all year,\u201d which seems like a spurious argument.</p> <p>Aluminum Consumption Fell Sharply </p> <p>Is there anything in particular to be made about of the drop-off in aluminum consumption?</p> <p>That\u2019s a reflection of contraction of manufacturing. You\u2019re going to see that in steel and coal statistics as well. That\u2019s pretty much across the board in the manufacturing sector.</p> <p>It Appears China Is in an Industrial Recession</p> <p></p> <p>The satellite index is the most negative and, presumably, the most reliable.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to hide from space. The satellite indices have been the most negative, but even traditional ones, the one done by Markit, the London\u2011based research firm, it\u2019s just been continually negative in manufacturing.</p> <p>Even their services indices, which are still above water, they\u2019re heading towards the contraction point. This is an economy which is slowly grinding to a halt.</p> <p>If they devalue their currency, presumably it makes their exports more competitive?</p> <p>Yeah, but they can\u2019t do that. The reason is they will trigger even worse capital outflow. They\u2019re basically prevented from doing that. Donald Trump says, \u201cWell, they\u2019re manipulating their currency to help their exporters.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, they are manipulating their currency, but they\u2019re keeping it at an artificially high value. They have to do that to prevent capital outflow. It\u2019s basically our exporters are being helped by China\u2019s currency manipulation now, which is a reversal, of course.</p> <p>Traditionally, China kept its currency below its market value in order to help exporters. Now, it\u2019s keeping it above market value.</p> <p>Industrial Profits Aren\u2019t Growing</p> <p></p> <p>How does the government talk about the stagnation in industrial profits?</p> <p>They don\u2019t. I think earnings, as reported out of Chinese companies can be a little bit not as reliable because of the nature of the accounting profession and other things. Nonetheless, it\u2019s more reliable than what comes out of the Bureau of National Statistics because some of those numbers are completely made up.</p> <p>It\u2019s just fantasy land. At least with the accountants, they\u2019ve got to at least have some responsibilities to the market. Therefore, it does give us a better window into what\u2019s actually happening.</p> <p>**This is true at the revenue level as well. If you look at the Shanghai Composite, revenues are not growing. This is also true of indices in the States. In many ways, it\u2019s the elephant in the room for global equity markets. Is there a way out of this? ** I don\u2019t think there is a way out of it. I think that they\u2019re heading to that adjustment as the Chinese economy continues to slow. Especially when it gets to that contraction point, where it\u2019s very close already, then I think we\u2019re going to see a lot of things happen very quickly.</p> <p>They\u2019re just hanging on right now, and they\u2019re able to do that. They can slow the inevitable, but they can\u2019t prevent it because they have not been able to repeal the laws of economics. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve now got this fight with Moody\u2019s over their ratings.</p> <p>That just shows, Moody\u2019s said, \u201cLook, you can\u2019t have the impossible trinity.\u201d China then gets outraged that Moody\u2019s would ever say that. What China\u2019s trying to do is say, \u201cWell, oh, the laws of economics do not apply to China.\u201d They do apply. They apply differently because of the degree of state control, which is becoming more and more state control, but nonetheless, they cannot prevent the inevitable.</p> <p>Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) Are Booming</p> <p></p> <p>Does this headline increase in non-performing (NPLs) capture the reality?</p> <p>The numbers have gone up, but the reported number is not nearly as high as they, in effect, are, because people are not applying international standards.</p> <p>A lot of this stuff is being rolled over, and so, therefore, it\u2019s being counted as good. It\u2019s only good because banks have been ordered not to call in loans. This means we\u2019ve seen a lot of credit growth, but we haven\u2019t seen growth in the economy, which you would expect.</p> <p>As interest builds up, you have to lend more and more just to roll over what exists. That\u2019s what occurring now. If you were to actually apply international standards to the loan books of these banks, we\u2019d be seeing NPL ratios of 20%\u201330%, easy.</p> <p>Banking Assets Are Ballooning</p> <p></p> <p>We\u2019ve got overall banking assets that have slowed to \u201cjust\u201d 40% growth year on year.</p> <p>It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s absolutely crazy. What they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re just throwing a lot of money. People say, \u201cWell, look, they\u2019ve got a relatively high reserve requirement ratio for the banks, and they\u2019ve got relatively high interest rates.\u201d</p> <p>They say, \u201cTherefore, they have a lot of ammunition.\u201d No, they don\u2019t, because you can throw more money into this economy, and it isn\u2019t going to do any good because there\u2019s a fundamental lack of demand for money.</p> <p>Yes, the government will build infrastructure, and yes, technically that does create gross domestic product, but it\u2019s only government directed. Private businesses just don\u2019t have a need for money, unless it\u2019s connected to some government infrastructure or other government program.</p> <p>That means, essentially, that it isn\u2019t going to work. You throw more money in this economy, you just have more money. You don\u2019t have more growth.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sad state in the world, when you think about it, if people are sitting around going, \u201cOh, you know, I don\u2019t need more money.\u201d That says a lot.</p> <p>That says a lot. China\u2019s not the only country with that problem, but their problem is so much greater than our problem here in the States, for instance.</p> <p>Did a Memo Go Out?</p> <p></p> <p>The all\u2011system financing aggregate hit an all\u2011time high, after having been trending downward. Is this just evidence that the government is opening a spigot somewhere?</p> <p>Absolutely. They\u2019ve done this before, and they say they\u2019re not going to do it again, because Premier Wen Jiabao, who authorized the stimulus program in November 2008, he put too much money into the economy.</p> <p>He created about as much credit in five years as the entire US banking system, even though in November 2008 the Chinese economy was less than a third the size of America\u2019s. Everyone said, \u201cWell, look, that\u2019s not what we should be doing.\u201d</p> <p>They say, \u201cOh, no, no, no, no, we\u2019ll never do that,\u201d but of course, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing. A memo did go out. Everyone was told to lend, and this is what we got. We got a lot of money supply.</p> <p>Real Estate: Supply Crunch?</p> <p></p> <p>If you look at the leading indicators of inventory, like land purchased and the actual amount of real estate that\u2019s under construction, you see it trending down. Meanwhile, you see a 50% year-on-year increase in the price of one square meter in a Tier 1 city.</p> <p>Tier 1\u00a0cities, there is still demand for real estate. There\u2019s no question about that. When you start going to Tier 3\u00a0cities, there\u2019s just enormous amount of supply, and there\u2019s very little demand, so it\u2019s a bifurcated market.</p> <p>If you\u2019re in Beijing and Shanghai, you have a relatively healthy real estate market, and prices are still going up. You start to get out of China\u2019s major cities, and there are real problems. What they did to create growth in the past was just to build, build, and build, and now they don\u2019t know what to do.</p> <p>Even in places like Guangdong Province, which is a relatively prosperous, modern province, you now have calls for state enterprises to buy apartments, because that\u2019s the only way they can do this to solve their problem, use one state entity to bail out another.</p> <p>There\u2019s a real problem once you get out of Beijing, and Shanghai, and Guangzhou.</p> <p>Where I live in Brooklyn, a million bucks buys you a fixer\u2011upper, but travel 500 miles in any direction and you can have almost whatever you want for that price. Is that the analogy?</p> <p>That\u2019s the same thing, yeah.</p> <p>A Retail-Driven Bubble? </p> <p>I want to ask you about retail investors and the domestic stock market. One of the things you notice when you look into it is there\u2019s this incredible boom in the number of trading accounts that were opened in the mainland. Then, the government discontinued the statistics on it.</p> <p>About two or three months after they discontinued the statistics, the Shanghai Composite hit its recent high. Did we see recent inflows of retail investors who were basically gamblers? Is that what\u2019s going on?</p> <p>There was a lot of that, especially because when you start to go back to September 2014 or so. Keqiang\u2019s policy was to talk up the stock market. You did have a lot of retail investors start to go into it, especially when prices started to move up. That created momentum.</p> <p>That\u2019s why you have a sharp increase in the number of retail accounts in the first part of 2015. Then, of course, June occurs. You have the beginnings of real problems. The markets start to turn down. Then you have retail investors start to leave, because they\u2019ve been burned, lost their money.</p> <p>I think that a lot of it was retail driven, but also, there\u2019s Chinese institutional money in there. Even some foreign money\u2019s starting to flood in when they saw the markets turn up. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going in, but the real sensitive stuff was the Chinese retail investors. When they get burned, that becomes a social stability issue.</p> <p>Why Do Vehicle Sales Keep Growing? </p> <p>Vehicle sales seem to be a bright point though.</p> <p>Vehicle sales have done really well. Vehicle sales started to tail off last summer, but they\u2019ve recovered. Right now, they\u2019re starting to turn down again. This has been a real pillar industry, and we have seen state enterprises go out and buy vehicles in the hundreds. They then store them. That\u2019s called lot rot. There\u2019s been a certain amount of that.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there\u2019s no question that vehicle sales have held up well. Either you see the wealthy in Tier 1 cities buying cars at a pretty healthy clip. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to last, but, nonetheless, it is one of the bright spots.</p> <p>So Bad It\u2019s Good? </p> <p>There\u2019s some sense that we\u2019re getting totally used to the negative economic surprises that are coming out. Our expectations are low. Maybe the news is so bad it\u2019s good on China. I wonder how you\u2019d react to that statement.</p> <p>Apart from what we saw in August and September last year when it was, as I mentioned, unimportant news really triggered very big falls in equity markets around the world. Now, I think people are not focused on China. They\u2019re focused on problems closer to home.</p> <p>I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving markets right now much more so than that. When China starts to have real troubles, then again, we\u2019re going to see the same phenomena that we saw last August and September. Again, I don\u2019t think that bad China news has really been discounted.</p> <p>A lot of people still say low sixes for growth. People are saying four, which the consensus is now at. If it really is closer to one or two, then clearly they haven\u2019t discounted all the bad news. When it gets to zero and negative one, watch out.</p> <p>Presumably there\u2019s even a threat to the government\u2019s ability to stay in power at that point.</p> <p>People talk about that right now. I was on a panel for a bank with Asian connections in Boston [several]\u00a0weeks ago. Afterwards, a young Chinese woman came up to my wife, and she\u2019s the type who would come to the United States, get an education, work five years, and then go back to China for their career.</p> <p>She told my wife, \u201cI\u2019m not going back. None of my friends are going back. My friends in China are saying this government might not last.\u201d Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of talk about that right now among Chinese themselves. There is a real issue about where this is going to go.</p> <p>Can the Government Keep Growing Revenues? </p> <p>One potentially reassuring thing is that the government has done a decent job at actually growing its revenues, although it\u2019s grown debt much faster.</p> <p>Spending is growing much faster than revenue growth.</p> <p>Yes, there was revenue growth in 2015, something on the order of, I forget exactly, like 7%\u00a0or 8%. Fiscal spending last year, according to the government itself, was up 15.8%. There\u2019s a pretty big gap there, and those are official numbers. Who knows what the real numbers are.</p> <p>We know that a lot of central government spending is not disclosed in the central government\u2019s budget. Military, for instance. A lot of military expenditures are not there.</p> <p>There have been fantastic increases in fiscal spending. Last October, fiscal spending year on year up 36.1%. November it was up 15.9%. They didn\u2019t disclose December, and I don\u2019t blame them, probably because it was pretty bad. This is an out of control spending government.</p> <p>While it\u2019s good for them that they\u2019ve got some revenues and they\u2019re able to drive that line higher, they\u2019re not able to drive it as fast as spending.</p> <p>You\u2019ve got to remember that in the work reports that we\u2019ve been seeing at the National People\u2019s Congress meeting, they\u2019re increasing their deficit from 2.4% of GDP, which is what they claimed for 2015, to 3% this year.</p> <p>Now, 3% is a psychological line, not just for the Chinese but for others. China is probably going to bust through 3% in reality, because they don\u2019t disclose all their spending. Who knows what they\u2019re going to be next year. This is not going in the right direction.</p> <p>I realize I haven\u2019t asked you at all about security. China\u2019s neighbor and a critical part of the global security question is North Korea, who\u2019s been testing their nuclear weapons . . .</p> <p>And long\u2011range missiles.</p> <p>. . . and threatening to use them preemptively. How should we be contextualizing that? Will China be an effective partner in working with the North, and what really can be done there?</p> <p>I don\u2019t think so, for a lot of reasons. First of all, the China and North Korea relation has eroded, especially after the execution of Jang Sung\u2011taek in December 2013, because Jang handled relations with Beijing.</p> <p>The real problem is you\u2019ve got a government in North Korea, a regime, where you have Kim Jung Un, the ruler, feuding with the military, which is still the most important institution in North Korean society. It\u2019s unstable, and I don\u2019t think the Chinese or anybody else can actually have much influence where you have intense infighting.</p> <p>Plus, also, you\u2019ve got intense infighting in Beijing. Not as bad as it looks like in Pyongyang, but, nonetheless, this is an unstable situation as well. You\u2019ve got two governments right now that are starting to splinter, and that means that north Asia is exceedingly dangerous.</p> <p>That\u2019s not great news, but thank you so much, Gordon, for sharing your view and for spending time with us.

If you just want to make someone\u2019s life\u00a0better, buy me a Jet Ski. If you want to have as big a positive impact on the world as possible, you are starting down an interesting, under-traveled, and complicated road.</p> <p>There is a spectrum of causes you can support, ranging from the sublime and spiritual to the frivolous. You can help a guy make potato salad, support a local museum, or save somebody\u2019s life.</p> <p>Clearly, one of these things is not like the other. And that should serve to clarify the stakes. But even charities with the same objectives can differ widely in terms of their effectiveness. Last month, Eric Friedman, CFA, made the point that some charities can make life-saving interventions for a fraction of the cost of other organizations.</p> <p>So, by using the right approach, you can save more than 600 lives for the cost of one. Conservatively.</p> <p>That sort of gap in performance denotes opportunity for investors, both in optimizing personal giving and in helping clients achieve the same efficiency. Friedman\u00a0and I connected over email to take the discussion a bit further, but certainly the hope is that it does not end here. We would both appreciate it if you would share your own questions in the comments section below.</p> <p>Will Ortel: One of the most influential concepts in investing is the idea of \u201cefficient\u201d markets, which basically states that it is difficult to beat the market because the best investment opportunities are spotted quickly and buyers bid up the price to fair value. Does this same principle apply in charitable giving?</p> <p>Eric Friedman, CFA: Somewhat, but not as much as in investments. A lot of donor money goes to the nonprofits that are best at fundraising, not necessarily those with the best programs.</p> <p>Fundraising success is more correlated with being able to tell compelling stories rather than being charities with evidence-based programs demonstrated to have a strong impact. Further, donors often constrain their giving to areas that they relate to, so causes that are not personally appealing to upper-middle-class and wealthy donors tend to be neglected.</p> <p>As a result, there are broad swaths of extremely effective charities that have huge funding gaps.</p> <p>There are some very savvy donors trying to close these gaps, but they are small relative to the total amounts donated. For example, grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is one of the most sophisticated donors and the largest foundation by far, are only about 1% of the size of what Americans donate annually.</p> <p>Investors frequently complain about not having access to enough information in making investment decisions. The same complaint is probably relevant for charities, but can you compare the information that decision makers use in both contexts?</p> <p>A key difference between information available to investors and donors is that the regulatory environment for information-sharing is much stricter for investments. For example, mutual funds have to disclose many things about their strategies, and their marketing material is tightly controlled to minimize their ability to over-promise or mislead. Investment firms typically can\u2019t highlight a single winning position without disclosing their whole portfolio performance.</p> <p>The same cannot be said about charities. While that might make donors cautious, there are also reasons to be more optimistic about the quality of information available.</p> <p>In the for-profit sector, participants protect their trade secrets and competitive advantages. In contrast, participants in the not-for-profit sector have aligned interests \u2014 making the world better \u2014 so there is greater potential for sharing information.</p> <p>In both investing and donating, there are experts who are professionally skilled at identifying the best places to allocate capital. One of the biggest differences is that in the investment world, those experts often guard that information as trade secrets, while experts in the charitable sector more frequently share it publicly.</p> <p>We are all familiar with portfolios where risk and return are balanced. Can the idea of optimizing risk and return be applied to charitable giving?</p> <p>One of the most important questions when considering a giving opportunity is the level of evidence that it will be effective. This can be thought of as tied to the level of risk. Some interventions have a lot of evidence, sometimes even being tested with similar scientific practices to what pharmaceutical companies are required to use to get new medicines approved. Other giving opportunities are not conducive to such hard evidence, such as with policy advocacy or research.</p> <p>As with investing, the lowest risk approach isn\u2019t necessarily the best, but taking risk is only desirable if it has the possibility for an outsized return \u2014 or impact.</p> <p>Charitable giving doesn\u2019t have a quantitative \u201cefficient frontier\u201d in the same sense as exists in investing, but risk and return are still important ideas.</p> <p>If I give without using this framework or a similar one, what are the risks?</p> <p>In the investing world, an adviser who is unconcerned about risk and return would undoubtedly be breaching fiduciary duties. With charitable giving, if you\u2019re not focused on the evidence behind your approach and the potential outcomes, then you\u2019re flying blind with respect to impact.</p> <p>The impact of a charity is fundamentally tricky to understand. Can you talk about that?</p> <p>Sometimes donors only take a surface look at the evidence for impact, which can lead them in the wrong direction.</p> <p>For example, many people who want to support education donate to college scholarships without thinking through how much the scholarships actually increase education versus facilitate people graduating with less debt.</p> <p>Or worse, scholarships may enable universities to get away without controlling costs. It isn\u2019t clear without a fairly deep understanding of the dynamics, but it is very possible that the impact of this type of donation is less than a donor might initially expect.</p> <p>In contrast, giving to some causes might be greater than what one might assume on initial consideration. For example, research indicates that treating parasitic intestinal worms in developing world countries actually increases educational and economic outcomes in addition to health, possibly by the flow-through effects of improved nutrition.</p> <p>This is an important reason why using intuition alone is often not a good strategy to maximize charitable impact.</p> <p>How does this compare to some of the key ways donors have historically evaluated charities?</p> <p>A lot of donors emphasize financial efficiency, such as evaluating charities based on the percentage they spend on overhead. The problem is that there can be very lean organizations that are not especially effective. In fact, \u201coverhead\u201d costs can often be critical for the success of a nonprofit, such as program evaluations and competitive salaries for quality staff.</p> <p>To create an analogy to the investing world, don\u2019t you want the companies you invest in to spend money on marketing, R&amp;D, and technology? Similarly, a certain level of overhead is critical for charities.</p> <p>Of course, donors can rest assured that a wasteful organization is unlikely to have a high impact by any legitimate measure. I think the nonprofit community as a whole now recognizes that it is better to evaluate the program impact of a charity. This is a more difficult task than computing a few ratios from a charity\u2019s IRS filings, but well worth the added effort.</p> <p>Many advisers shy away from talking about charitable giving with their clients because they view it as too complex or not their specialty. Is there something that simplifies the research process and gives donors access to a broadly diversified, rigorously constructed basket of charities?</p> <p>Yes. There are several charity evaluators that do very robust research and share their results publicly. The really good ones only give their top ratings to a handful of the most deserving charities.</p> <p>The group I work with, The Life You Can Save, aggregates research from several reliable sources to provide a broader list of recommendations than any one source individually. Importantly, we try hard to present the information in a way that is easy to digest for both financial advisers and donors.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter**. **</p> <p>\ufeff\ufeffThis post was first published by CFA Institute.</p>","tags":["philanthropy","interviews"]},{"location":"blog/2016/05/07/confused-yet-convinced-the-market-view-of-financial-technology/","title":"Confused, Yet Convinced: The Market View of Financial Technology","text":"<p>This was written for (and first published by) CFA Institute.</p> <p>If you want to test yourself as an analyst, decide that technology is going to change the investment business, and then set out to understand exactly how.</p> <p>There are a number of trends that cross over from technology. AirBnB, now effectively one of the world\u2019s largest hotels, owns none of the real estate it offers. Uber has gained immense market share by streamlining the annoying process of getting a cab\u2026 and by the way, they don\u2019t employ any drivers.</p> <p>Will the investment services of the future use no money? It\u2019s not a crazy question. Some of the highest profile financial technology companies operate on precisely that premise. So-called \u201cmarketplace\u201d lenders, like Lending Club and On Deck Capital, aim to bring suppliers and consumers of capital together on the same platform, set appropriate interest rates based on risk, and service the loans throughout their lives.</p> <p>These companies have grown immensely, but to critics they still have a lot to prove. Today Lending Club and On Deck Capital change hands for less than 35% of their IPO prices, and there is a reason for that. The institutional investors who were funding the loans made by these platforms have gotten less enthusiastic about supplying capital. And that means the lenders\u2019 business models will need to evolve. As Fitch Ratings puts it, the firms are confronting \u201cmarket realities.\u201d</p> <p>Optimism was once at a fever pitch. About eighteen months ago, I spoke with four different funds in a single week who all had more than a quarter of their portfolios invested in Lending Club loans. This was surprising, since they were as different as one could imagine, and hadn\u2019t done much else in credit until finding the platform. But it was easy to use, and offered them an exposure that was hard to find elsewhere without going through scores of intermediaries.</p> <p>So we have two realities that apply to the same companies: passionate users with good reasons to like the product, and stock charts that go from top left to bottom right. What the heck is going on? Should we be worried about the future of this category?</p> <p>Ashby Monk, executive and research director of the Stanford Global Projects Center, considered this question a few weeks ago in Institutional Investor. His answer: \u201cNah.\u201d The thinking is that what we\u2019re seeing is really growing pains as marketplace lenders evolve to find more stable pools of capital to support themselves. As many have learned over time, counting on continued favor from the hedge fund community is a great way to be disappointed.</p> <p>In contrast, large institutional investors can be slow slow to embrace change, but think in decades and centuries. They are also continuously looking to deploy capital and increasingly attentive to the fees their intermediaries feast upon.</p> <p>So, it makes sense that pension funds looking to invest in loans would seek out ways to invest in them directly. The experience of the firms that have come to market so far may not actually tell us much about the validity of that premise, since a sufficiently large fund might even set up their (fully vertically integrated) program with its own constraints and objectives. Success then becomes somewhat personal, and difficult to judge from the comfort of your keyboard.</p> <p>It\u2019s not without irony that this version of the financial future is rather apart from the one brought to us by Uber and AirBNB. For one thing, what we are contemplating is a world where technology services employ a tremendous amount of their own capital. For another, this is just one possible future.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["investment industry","technology"]},{"location":"blog/2016/05/10/for-social-media-success-be-curious-conversational-and-patient/","title":"For Social Media Success, Be Curious, Conversational, and Patient","text":"<p>If you\u2019re on social media just trying to get famous, stop.</p> <p>Many investment professionals are naturally competitive people, myself included. Accustomed to being benchmarked and trained to quantify impact, we run an unusual risk of thinking that social media is a contest.</p> <p>But applying that perspective is counterproductive. It\u2019s a bit like going to a dinner party and trying to keep score. People might be into it if you have strange friends, but there\u2019s a better chance that you will alienate everyone there.</p> <p>So what do you do?</p> <p>During a panel conversation, \u201cHow Social Media Is Changing Financial Services (and How to Adapt),\u201d at the 69th CFA Institute Annual Conference, Marissa Pick, director of social media at CFA Institute; Michael Batnick, CFA, director of research at\u00a0Ritholtz Wealth Management; and Tadas Viskanta, founder and editor of Abnormal Returns, gave their perspectives on social media\u2019s value proposition and how to best leverage the technology. It turns out it\u2019s not rocket science.</p> <p>Show Up Looking to Learn</p> <p>Only 29% of respondents to an audience poll said that they use social media as part of their research process. That came as a surprise. Social media can be a critical information-gathering tool. Research from MIT Sloan indicates that users who follow a diverse network of experts on Twitter come up with measurably better ideas.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean that starting a Twitter account is a magic bullet. Following a given Kardashian won\u2019t do much for you, and the behaviors discussed in the paper are good ideas in general: Pay attention to a wide range of informed views.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t mean views on which direction stocks are going to move. Both Viskanta and Batnick agreed that reading forecasts and stock picks is the least interesting part of using Twitter. There are plenty of other things to share! For instance, here\u2019s an article Batnick\u00a0highlighted detailing the struggles of the hedge fund industry . . . in 1969.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that more interesting than 140 characters about somebody\u2019s favorite trade? One of the things that is hard to understand for people who are new to social media is that it\u2019s important to always keep your audience in mind. A given trade recommendation will only be compelling to a small number of people who share your time frame and investment beliefs. Information is much more interesting than recommendations.</p> <p>But Don\u2019t Forget Conversations!</p> <p>Viskanta also made an important point: Social media is certainly a broadcast medium, but it is more than just that. Remember the analogy about the dinner party? It\u2019s considered bad manners to remain completely silent during dinner, and for good reason: It\u2019s kind of a weird thing to do.</p> <p>Part of the magic of social media, Viskanta noted, is that it really is a conversation. This is a truism that cynics often ignore. There are lots of silly things being said about social media. Look no further than AOL\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cDigital Prophet\u201d Shingy. And though it\u2019s fun to read about an over-the-top evangelist of a trend you don\u2019t understand and dismiss it, it is far from productive.</p> <p>Instead, think about what it means that these tools exist. At minimum, it means that you can ask that question that popped into your head. It also means that you probably should. When you respond on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, whatever, it may feel like you are responding to words. But really you are responding to a person. People react well when you respond thoughtfully to something that they wrote or said. I know it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.</p> <p>But a lot can come from a conversation, so it\u2019s worth remembering that you can do more with your interaction than just make someone feel good. For instance, Viskanta played a big role in my own professional development just by doing his thing. In the early days of my investment career, I relied immensely on his curation to get a handle on who and what was interesting. And years later, I was able to tell him that to his face over dinner.</p> <p>Of course, he didn\u2019t know that until I told him, and there was a 9- or 10-year lag between when I started reading Abnormal Returns and when I was finally able to thank Tadas in person for the early career solid he did for me. Over that time, he\u2019s evolved his offering considerably, but he\u2019s stayed consistent and true to himself.</p> <p>If You Do One Thing, Make It That</p> <p>Regardless of the platform or platform combination that you choose to adopt or the content that you choose to engage with, it bears repeating that you won\u2019t create much value for yourself if you\u2019re not doing something you actually find valuable. There is no sense trying to score internet points by getting LinkedIn likes or Twitter hearts. Concentrate instead on trying to learn things from others that will elevate your ability to serve your clients.</p> <p>Batnick\u00a0recommended a few Twitter accounts to follow, and I agree with all of his recommendations. Simply going in and reading a few tweets from each of these handles is a good start. Keeping up with Viskanta\u2019s work is also a great way to see longer-form commentary from all kinds of different sources to get a better sense of what most interests you.</p> <p>There are plenty of tools and plenty of social networks, but if you\u2019re just getting started and primarily looking to learn, there really is nowhere better than Twitter. It may be ironic that a network that emphasizes brevity and immediacy has evolved into tremendously useful tool for long-term investors. But that doesn\u2019t make it untrue.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["attention economy","on writing"]},{"location":"blog/2016/05/13/think-different-but-be-right/","title":"Think Different, But Be Right","text":"<p>This was first published by CFA Institute.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a crazy idea: If you want to perform better than everyone else, start by doing something different from them.</p> <p>This should be intuitive, but it\u2019s not exactly easy. If clients are asking what you\u2019ve done for them lately and your competitors are turning in great performances, it takes serious fortitude to stick to your special difference.</p> <p>But the promise of such a strategy is significant, according to Rupal J. Bhansali, executive vice president and chief investment officer for global equities at Ariel Investments. While she says implementing such a process promises a stroll down the \u201cpath of most resistance,\u201d I would be a little bit disappointed if that turned you off to the approach.</p> <p>And the reason for that is simple: If you\u2019re a professional investor, your job is to turn effort into alpha.</p> <p>So you better work.</p> <p>But there are things you can do to make your life easier. For starters, don\u2019t waste time on looking into businesses that don\u2019t meet one of your core criteria. Bhansali uses a process of elimination, screening out companies with unattractive characteristics so that an attractive opportunity set \u201crises to the top like cream over milk.\u201d</p> <p>Bhansali works to avoid investments that:</p> <ul> <li>Are only optically cheap. This makes sense. As Bhansali says, \u201cMarkets don\u2019t reward trading on information that everybody else has,\u201d and headline metrics like P/E ratio are the poster children for information that everyone else has access to. Instead, derive a solid estimate for value based on the business itself.</li> <li>Employ creative accounting. This doesn\u2019t mean fraud. Bhansali focuses on avoiding \u201caccounting chicanery,\u201d which boils down to a business getting ahead of itself in its financial statements.</li> <li>Derive returns from a low-quality business. We\u2019ve all seen companies that are making money through a byzantine mix of macro tailwinds, cheap leverage, and dumb luck. Life is too short to try and make money there. As Bhansali says, \u201clow quality businesses will compound your problems, not your returns.\u201d</li> <li>Have a weak balance sheet. Why take the risk? \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we are equity investors,\u201d Bhansali says. \u201cWe are at the bottom of the cap structure. We have an option value in the business only if there\u2019s something left over. If there\u2019s nothing left over and debt holders claim a lot of the value of the company, then that option is worthless.\u201d</li> <li>Are likely to revert to the mean. Lots of businesses are cyclical, and at the top of the cycle there is always a hope that they\u2019ve managed to change their fundamental nature.</li> <li>Mules do not change into thoroughbreds. Channeling Henry Kissinger, Bhansali notes that \u201chope is not a strategy.\u201d</li> <li>Are about to be disrupted. Ignoring the competitive threat from a new potential entrant is a bit like hoping for a return to the flat world. Bhansali reminds us that \u201cAmazon nixed brick and mortar. Shale fracking broke the nexus between oil and gas.\u201d Don\u2019t be casual about the risk that the world changes and leaves your favorite investment in the dust.</li> </ul> <p>So what?</p> <p>All of this is great advice, and the sort of thing that you might expect to hear about from a CFA Institute staffer. I like to think folks would be a little weirded out if we were suggesting paying attention to only headline P/E multiples and investing in companies that were about to be disrupted.</p> <p>The crux of pulling off this process is the contrarian bit. As Bhansali notes, there is no payoff in\u00a0seeing something that everybody else saw too. So instead, look for situations where the \u201cbad news is priced in, but the good news is not.\u201d This is easier said than done. Not only is it a hard problem for you, the analyst, to actually come up with a set of compelling ideas, it\u2019s tough to get your clients to stick with you long enough to find out that your research was good.</p> <p>On this, Bhansali had a really useful suggestion: \u201cYou need to tell people that what you are serving is fine dining, not fast food.\u201d Remind them not to measure your performance after five minutes, since the meal won\u2019t even be cooked yet.</p> <p>And while you\u2019re at it, you might remind them that eating nothing but fast food is a terrible long-term strategy.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["value investing","investment industry"]},{"location":"blog/2016/05/26/economic-thinking-thats-ready-for-retirement/","title":"Economic Thinking That's Ready for Retirement","text":"<p>If I win, you lose.</p> <p>It\u2019s an insight that anybody who\u2019s spent time on a playground has had at some point or another. And for a broad spectrum of human activity, it\u2019s completely correct. Most games have winners and losers. And usually, wanting to win promotes good behavior.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been both a player and a coach, and I have never found a better approach than getting enough sleep, eating right, and showing up ready to work hard. If you\u2019re having fun, the rest is detail. And healthy competition tends to encourage exactly this sort of good behavior.</p> <p>But there is only so much you can learn from the playground, and unfortunately, there is an all-too-common tendency to apply schoolyard logic in places where it has no bearing, such as international trade.</p> <p>So, I was glad to see that when we asked CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief readers which of four economic ideas is most ready for retirement, a plurality (42%) of 675 respondents chose the notion that one country\u2019s growth is another country\u2019s lost opportunity.</p> <p>That is not how things work.</p> <p>For one, considering economic trends in the context of countries winning and losing is about as cutting-edge as mercantilism, which institutionalized such analysis.</p> <p>As the fall in oil prices reminded us over the past two years, sometimes it really is the case that nobody is in control. Winds blow, and some countries are better placed to harness them than others. Indeed, too much focus on winning can cause the analyst to believe a sovereign is at its strongest just as the weather shifts.</p> <p>It can also give rise to protectionism, a force today\u2019s leaders seem unable to resist despite repeated (and increasingly humiliating) protestations to the contrary. Following a November 2008 G\u201320 summit in Washington, D.C., world leaders released a statement underscoring \u201cthe critical importance of rejecting protectionism and not turning inward in times of financial uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>This was reiterated again by the same group in 2009, with a communique that read, \u201cWe will not repeat the historic mistakes of protectionism of previous eras\u201d.</p> <p>That sentiment lasted for about a minute. A 2012 report titled \u201cD\u00e9b\u00e2cle,\u201d by Global Trade Alert, provides a good summary of how what was done\u00a0differed from what was said.</p> <p>Spoiler alert: It did, a lot.</p> <p>In a 2015 report for the European parliament\u2019s think tank, authors Roberta Barone and Roberto Bendini laid to rest any hope that world leaders had actually stayed true to their word, writing: \u201cUnfortunately, this pledge to refrain from adopting new trade-restrictive measures \u2014 and to roll-back those in place \u2014 has not been honored. For the sixth year, the global institutions monitoring protectionism in the G\u201320 have confirmed the accumulation of new trade-restrictions and few efforts to liberalise trade.\u201d</p> <p>Now stop for a second and think. How did the preceding couple of paragraphs read to you: like good news? Bad? You\u2019re wrong in either case. In particular if you\u2019re a die-hard free-trader, I would encourage you to examine what happens to labor markets as business adapts to the sorts of sudden trade shocks that come from low-priced foreign competition.</p> <p>There is no doubt that a good long-term plan to nurture a domestic industry might involve some tariffs or trade restrictions at some point. The excellent (and now basically free) book The Silent War: Inside the Global Business Battles Shaping America\u2019s Future details some cases in which\u00a0governments have deployed restrictive policies to develop the groundwork for future economic miracles.</p> <p>Which economic idea is most ready for retirement? </p> <p>The second-place finisher in our poll, with 28% of the vote, was the premise that free market competition always creates positive outcomes. I\u2019ve got a little statue of a bull on my desk right next to my nameplate, and am generally inclined to be in favor of\u00a0markets \u00a0\u2014 but they can be shortsighted sometimes. Some current examples of objectionable activity we can thank free market competition for: marketing e-cigarettes to children, unregulated gold mines dumping mercury into Amazon rivers, and ultrasound clinics in Ontario that show you stock photos instead of your baby.</p> <p>Each of these each seem like open-and-shut cases where regulatory attention is warranted. But it\u2019s important to remember that something is lost every time something is regulated, and it\u2019s deeply tricky to effectively police what should not be done without stamping out activity that could have been productive. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hyperbolic to suggest that a child could needlessly die because these fly-by-night ultrasound clinics prevented parents from recognizing that a pregnancy is in trouble. And their presence erodes trust in generally hardworking medical professionals. But it\u2019s not trivial to eliminate them (or any of these other practices) without creating bottlenecks. Unfortunately, \u201cprudent regulation\u201d does not have the curb appeal of \u201cfree markets.\u201d</p> <p>Emergent themes.</p> <p>The last two responses nearly split the balance of the vote, with the premise that individuals need paid employment to contribute to society receiving 15% and the thought that GDP is the best measure of a country\u2019s economic activity getting 15%.</p> <p>This makes sense: they are quite related. Both augur in one way or another for some means of evaluating activity that is not denominated in currency. The shortcomings of GDP are documented well enough that the European Commission has a page dedicated to quotes enumerating them as part of their \u201cBeyond GDP\u201d initiative.</p> <p>It also may surprise you to note that it\u2019s not a measure as deeply baked into history as, say, profitability or revenue. A quick search of published books shows that GDP experienced a sharp upswing in usage during the 1990s, rather than the sustained level of interest that you might expect.</p> <p>The premise that we should detach a job from the notion of one\u2019s economic value is also gaining significant steam, with interest in a so-called \u201cbasic income\u201d even reaching Bill Gross\u2019s latest investment outlook.

And indeed clients are served in our industry through acts of judgment and discipline amid uncertainty, not just miracles of prophecy.</p> <p>I am going to wager that you, or at least someone at your firm, was in the office this past weekend. The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (EU). There will be other agitations and indeed other elections along the same lines in the months and years to come.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t already, I suggest you take a look at Geopolitics for Investors, a recent publication of the CFA Institute Research Foundation and authored by Pippa Malmgren, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and an advocate for Brexit.</p> <p>An invitation to consider the thought processes of a reputable person who is cheering the Brexit should be interesting regardless of your level of pre-existing knowledge. It\u2019s always neat to look at the radar of someone who thinks differently than you. And Malmgren thinks differently than many of us, if recent market behavior is any indication.</p> <p>But to navigate the changing contours of the world productively, you\u2019ll need to do more than just peek over someone\u2019s shoulder. Successful active managers create their own context on a continuous basis. They take facts, relate them to possible futures, and construct rigorous understandings that are robust enough to survive surprise developments. The combination of analytical rigor and imagination produces an edge.</p> <p>Assuming You Add Effort</p> <p>To put it mildly, there is nothing easy about developing a valuable viewpoint. It is the strong form of a hard thing: You won\u2019t know if you have succeeded for a long time, and it takes tremendous judgment to even choose how you spend your day.</p> <p>We have done some things that we hope will make it easier for you though, and the purpose of this post is to summarize and present them in a practical\u00a0form.</p> <p>The first and most holistically useful is the Investment Idea Generation Guide that Jason Voss, CFA, and I authored late last year. It is meant to be helpful\u00a0in general, but you may find it to be of particular value if you were caught by surprise last week.</p> <p>Jason introduced me to a technique called scenario planning, which is a little bit different than you might expect on first look. It has more in common with a vision quest than a financial model that combines base, aggressive, and adverse cases to derive an expectation of value.</p> <p>Be Ready to Get Weird</p> <p>The goal of investment research is to produce a viewpoint that is fundamentally different from what others believe and yet is still correct. Think different, but be right, in other words. The challenge we collectively face is not how to organically reach the same conclusion as others, but how to stick out in useful and forward-looking ways.</p> <p>We don\u2019t live in a world that is short on risks, so it will pay to get ahead of the curve a little bit here. The World Economic Forum\u2019s 2016 risks report may be valuable\u00a0at a time like this. As you read it, consider which of the issues it raises\u00a0you haven\u2019t thought about in a week, a month, or more. Study those.</p> <p>But Stay Focused, Rational, and Upbeat</p> <p>There is a deep tragedy to some outcomes that we are forced by fiduciary duty to contemplate.</p> <p>If you are doing your scenario planning correctly, you will consider things like the possibility of all-out war in Europe, sectarian violence that scales globally, and weaponized diseases.</p> <p>You will also do well to remember that, in general, the world is a good place to live. There are few alternatives. Elon Musk has said that he\u2019d like to die on Mars, but he might need a little something more in the way of cash flow\u00a0to get there. When economic winds change, some dreams are blown away.</p> <p>But the long-term trends that form the basis of a broadly improving human condition are still intact. Whatever happens in politics, life expectancy is up sharply. We can now edit DNA, which promises to remake the fabric of the human condition. There is never a bad time to start an innovative business. Macro trends have no bearing on entrepreneurial ambition.</p> <p>However bad you think a given development is, it is worth remembering that the productive step is to put your focus in a positive place. Real businesses were built during the Great Depression. People made money during the financial crisis. Despite myriad predictions to the contrary, the sun still rises every day in the east.</p> <p>This thing, whatever it is, will be fine in the long term. Don\u2019t let it keep you from hunting for opportunity.</p>","tags":["brexit","economic geography"]},{"location":"blog/2016/07/13/and-then-what/","title":"And Then What?","text":"<p>Keep asking the titular question and you\u2019ll stay out of trouble,\u00a0says Charlie Munger, a man we would all do well to emulate.</p> <p>Nearly 125\u00a0years after the birth of Ben Graham, the investing profession\u2019s organizing genius, that same question loomed large over a group of practitioners gathered at the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA) for the Annual Benjamin Graham Conference,\u00a0during which\u00a0they\u00a0considered the future of an activity with a rich past \u2014 and an uncertain future.</p> <p>Leon Cooperman, CFA, formerly of Goldman Sachs and presently of Omega Advisors, set a less-than-promising tone for the day. Noting the rise of passive investing and the reasonably high probability that automation will transform numerous professional fields, investing among them, he suggested that younger attendees would perhaps be best served by seeking employment in some other industry.</p> <p>After\u00a0all, the business of fund management\u00a0is to deploy capital in search of unusual returns, and the consensus in our world is diminished opportunity.</p> <p>**There are only so many sources of return. ** For investors in common equities, they are traditionally considered an expansion in earnings, an expansion of the multiple at which those earnings are valued, or some form of financial engineering that accelerates the delivery of earnings \u2014 present or future \u2014 to equity holders.</p> <p>The former two \u2014 the organic sorts of growth \u2014 are not thought to be forthcoming in the current environment.</p> <p>In aggregate, the largest US companies are not growing sales. I can hardly remember a major economic development in recent history that did not cause the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revise its growth outlook downward. Indeed, the IMF\u00a0pointed to Brexit this time, but it also revised estimates downwards every quarter this year.</p> <p>It\u2019s still good sense to look for reasons why an index might rally further, but be prepared for a profound feeling of ennui. In the absence of organic growth, investors have shifted their appetites towards predictable cash-flow streams. General Mills\u2019 rich valuation is an illuminating case in point. The company\u00a0trades for more than 20 times its projected earnings in the next year. An optimist might see this as a harbinger of innovative breakfast experiences to come. An analyst is more likely to consider it part of a broader flight to perceived safety.</p> <p>A bond-like stock might just be tailor-made for this purportedly low-return environment, but those disposed to that school of thought would do well to do more than just read macroeconomic commentary about the implications of such a phenomenon \u2014\u00a0there is no shortage of analysis. Think: What happens after a low-return environment?</p> <p>**It goes away. ** Indeed, when my colleague Roger Urwin gave thoughtful and pragmatic guidance on \u201cAsset Allocation in a Low-Return Environment\u201d almost 10\u00a0years ago, it would have been difficult for most observers to imagine the rapid shift in sentiment that followed. JP Morgan bought Bear Stearns for $2 a share just 16\u00a0months later, and a low-return environment gave way to a generational buying opportunity.</p> <p>I am not forecasting a crisis, nor did any of the panelists. But\u00a0many believe that risks loom within indices apparently priced for perfection.</p> <p>One signal indication of that came when conference moderator\u00a0Michael Oliver Weinberg, CFA, turned the conversation to the utility sector. He asked \u201cDoes anyone feel the growing adoption of solar technology is not an existential threat to these companies?\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p> <p>And this is not a small matter. Investors in utility companies are in many cases making their allocations under the theory that not much will change, or at least not to an extent to\u00a0affect demand for the product their assets are developing: electricity.</p> <p>This is a bad assumption. We are likely to see material shifts in both the energy demand profile and the way power is generated going forward. It is doubtful\u00a0utilities will respond in a universally nimble fashion.</p> <p>**Indices don\u2019t cure idiosyncrasy. ** This should be obvious to those who remember that last year Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google (FANG) may have contributed more to the return of the S&amp;P 500 index than the other 496 companies combined. But panelist\u00a0Steven\u00a0Bregman, CFA, of\u00a0Horizon Kinetics, took it a step further. He sees more than just \u201cno values in the sector funds,\u201d but idiosyncratic risk as well.</p> <p>It would be foolish to forget that some sector funds are really quite concentrated in just a few companies. The utility sector exchange-traded fund (ETF) has more than 25% of its portfolio in its top three holdings, as of this writing. The energy sector ETF has almost 34% in its top two.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean there is a famine of opportunity. Far from it.</p> <p>Against this dour macro commentary, Miguel Fidalgo of Triarii Capital was quick to point out that the world doesn\u2019t move in macro lockstep: \u201cWe\u2019re invested in Greece . . . it\u2019s not the top of the business cycle over there.\u201d This was perhaps the understatement of the day, but it made\u00a0the useful point that we are\u00a0poorly served by letting dour headlines become the full story. Indeed, there are certain to be individual cash-flow streams that grow no matter what happens. That\u2019s why staying positive and driven is so critical to our long-term success as investors.</p> <p>But though individual names and income streams may grow, the way we invest has gotten a little bit weird. The Economist recently profiled the amazing rise of Vanguard, which in general has been a massive boon to investors, including myself. Few question Vanguard\u2019s\u00a0motives, but it may be time to wonder about the long-term implications\u00a0of the investment philosophy it has long championed.</p> <p>Bregman noted an \u201cETF Vortex\u201d that, in his view, is distorting the clearing prices of almost all large assets around the world. An index can create a self-reinforcing notion of value, so this makes some sense.</p> <p>**It should also create opportunity. ** Whatever distortion ETFs, indices, the US Federal Reserve, or anything else is creating in asset prices, it\u2019s worth remembering that markets work in an altogether better fashion today than they did in Ben Graham\u2019s time. The notion that we could use accounting information to make a decision about which companies to invest in was once controversial. The job title \u201cinvestment analyst\u201d has not existed for that long.</p> <p>In a sense, it is remarkable progress just that we have a forum for these conversations. But we shouldn\u2019t take too much comfort from that. A forum is only as good as the curiosity that it feeds, and so a big part of me is glad that so many thoughtful practitioners joined us to ask \u2014 in one way or another \u2014 and then what?</p> <p>I hope you\u2019ll join us next time.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you really ought to subscribe to my newsletter**. **</p> <p>\ufeffThis post was first published by CFA Institute.</p>","tags":["value investing","investment industry","idea generation"]},{"location":"blog/2016/07/15/no-alternatives-and-the-things-that-really-matter/","title":"No Alternatives and the Things That Really Matter","text":"<p>I first wrote this for CFA Institute and published it on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>There must be some alternative.</p> <p>Jesse Felder took to Twitter on Wednesday to enumerate various \u201conly games in town.\u201d In no particular order, they are:</p> <ul> <li>Equities</li> <li>US corporate bonds</li> <li>US Treasuries</li> <li>Equity income strategies</li> <li>Central bankers with extraordinary powers</li> </ul> <p>It would seem, at least from first examination, that supposedly choice-starved investors are more like New York City sports fans than victims of a famine.

And I guess I should also mention there\u2019s a decent chance your new t-shirt or skirt won\u2019t look as nice either.</p> <p>Because especially if you\u2019re buying the cheap stuff, the odds are excellent that a slave is somewhere in the economies of scale that brought it to you. And I mean the strong form of slave: A human who is bought and sold.</p> <p>Depressingly, this holds for almost any kind of \u201ccheap stuff\u201d you might care to discuss.</p> <p>And that brings me to the part of the story that\u2019s uniquely applicable to investors: where we have risk, opportunity, and indeed a chance to de-slave the world.</p> <p>That\u2019s probably worth it, right?</p> <p>But I\u2019m writing about this here, so something should be obvious. The case against slavery is about more than just morality. It\u2019s also about money and a material risk to a broad cross section of widely owned businesses that is underappreciated, potentially disastrous, and (in time) easily mitigated.</p> <p>So that\u2019s why I\u2019m not trying to knock you off the fence on the question of whether people buying and selling other people is your fight.</p> <p>The point is that, unless you\u2019re careful, it might be your business.</p> <p>Before I get to how pervasive it is, let\u2019s take a second to keep in mind the investment environment of the day:\u00a0Growth is not that easy to find. Risks are. Whatever stocks may be at the moment, they are not cheap in most of the developed world. And at this point, it\u2019s kind of an article of faith that someday, somehow, interest rates will return.</p> <p>When stocks are fully valued, reducing risk is a value-creating act.</p> <p>Interest rates are low. Equity markets are open. Money is reasonably priced and available for most large companies. So now let\u2019s talk about slavery.</p> <p>It\u2019s pervasive.</p> <p>Almost\u00a021 million people live in slavery today, according to the International Labor Organization (ILO).</p> <p>That\u2019s the lowest estimate I was able to find. If all 21 million were gathered in one place,\u00a0they would compose one of the largest cities in the world.</p> <p>The US Department of Labor (DOL) maintains a (likely incomplete)\u00a0list of goods produced with forced labor or child labor\u00a0broken down by country.</p> <p>Fifty-five goods are made or acquired using forced labor in 37 different nations, the DOL reports. Coal, cotton, coltan, and cocoa are some of the raw materials harvested through that labor. So it\u2019s conceivable slavery made it into your clothing or perhaps even the circuits that you are using to read this.</p> <p>And that\u2019s just the letter \u201cC.\u201d</p> <p>The problem \u2014 the reason people capture, trade, and own slaves \u2014 is that their stolen potential has monetary value. A t-shirt that was produced by people working against their will looks the same as one that wasn\u2019t. So does a diamond, a Christmas ornament, or a children\u2019s toy.</p> <p>This is a good time to think about what you\u2019re wearing and wonder: Has a slave touched your socks? You won\u2019t get an answer.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tough question.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t seen the complexity of such a\u00a0question described better than in the essay \u201cI, Pencil\u201c:\u00a0Leonard Read\u2019s fictional account of the genealogy of a pencil. One line in particular is relevant. And, remember, a pencil is speaking: \u201cJust as you cannot trace your family tree back very far, so is it impossible for me to name and explain all my antecedents.\u201d</p> <p>You get it. Things we perceive as simple are actually quite complicated. The pencil mentions its lead was mined in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and a paper sack was manufactured and discarded to carry it from place to place. Then it was shipped all around the world before mixing with clay from Mississippi and ammonium hydroxide.</p> <p>It goes on. Imagine how much more complex a smartphone is. So there\u2019s a good\u00a0reason that if you ask a given company whether a slave touched your particular pair of socks, the ornaments on your Christmas tree, or even just your chocolate bar, you\u2019ll most likely receive an incomplete answer.</p> <p>That shouldn\u2019t be, and it doesn\u2019t need to stay that way forever.</p> <p>Slavery exists today on the other side of a semiporous wall from most consumers. The cheap products that slaves manufacture are efficiently aggregated into global supply chains and transmitted around the world. The invisible mechanism that takes cotton from Uzbekistan\u00a0to garment factories in Bangladesh and then overseas and eventually onto your back is called the market.</p> <p>And the market should have, can have, and must have a baseline ethics that values the dignity of human beings independent of what they can be forced to produce.</p> <p>Now.</p> <p>It takes a long time to change the world, but only a moment to make up your mind. It\u2019s not so hard to imagine that if you\u2019ve read this far you are inclined to do something.</p> <p>But what?</p> <p>First, think. Do me a favor and leave a comment below. How do you think the investment community can best express a wish not to be complicit in\u00a0slave labor? How can we speak so that the management teams you work with will listen?</p> <p>Your guess is as good as mine. But I\u2019d suggest a simple question will be quite effective: \u201cCan you assert that your supply chain is free of forced labor?\u201d</p> <p>Ask it in conference calls, one on one, and in annual meetings. And whatever the answer is, if it boils down to \u201cno,\u201d follow up with \u201cWhen will you be able to prove that assertion?\u201d</p> <p>The product of stolen labor should not be able to find a market. And if the largest companies do their due diligence to ensure they are not unwittingly enabling this reprehensible trade, it will become harder and harder to make money through slavery.</p> <p>You can help bring that about with an email.

It was written for CFA Institute and first published by the Enterprising Investor. I'm grateful to Ambassador Sarah Mendelson and the US State Department for the opportunity.</p> <p>Big questions usually come with incomplete answers.</p> <p>Are you fulfilling your purpose? Is there life on other planets? Do you drink too much coffee? My own answer to the last one is a definite yes, but it would be hard to answer the other two with even a remotely similar degree of confidence.</p> <p>Sometime between my parents\u2019 generation and my own, the idea that a business could do both well (in a financial sense) and good (in a social sense) has entered the mainstream. Of course, at a general level, that is a bit like saying how great it is to get equity-like returns with bond-like risk: fluffy, sales-y, and skepticism inducing.</p> <p>But it\u2019s something people say because there is a large and growing body of evidence that it\u2019s for real.</p> <p>And if you think like a manager for a moment, it should be intuitive why this is. Start with employee engagement and retention: Doesn\u2019t it stand to reason you\u2019ll be better able to tap into the energy of your employees if they feel their work supports a cause they find meaningful? Isn\u2019t it likely that would have at least some bearing on your ability to compete and, indeed, on whether you succeed?</p> <p>Yes, But . . . </p> <p>That intuition is great for managers, but it\u2019s hard for investors to translate into something actionable. We can audit the degree to which a company is \u201cdoing good\u201d by examining the information it releases on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, but the path from disclosure to value creation is a murky one.</p> <p>One straightforward reason for this is that a lot of the information that exists is not intended for investors. And though there is convincing\u00a0evidence that good performance on selected industry-specific materiality data leads to increased returns, translating those aggregate-level insights into portfolio-appropriate ideas is not a linear process.</p> <p>With these issues in mind, it seemed natural to ask what readers of\u00a0CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief\u00a0thought of how examining these disclosures might\u00a0yield better returns.</p> <p>Do you think analyzing ESG factors can boost returns?*</p> <p></p> <p>* Results do not add up to 100% due to rounding.</p> <p>Though only 7%\u00a0of the 535 respondents said \u201cof course\u201d and suggested we Google it, the responses\u00a0are quite consistent with my own belief that the investment profession sees at least the seed of alpha generation within ESG disclosures.</p> <p>This is a question quite distinct from one we\u2019ve asked much more rigorously in the recent past: Do you take ESG issues into account?\u00a0Of CFA Institute members, 73%\u00a0say they do, mostly because they view the analysis as a way to manage investment risks or because their clients demand it.</p> <p>The plurality of respondents (37%) said something quite different: that these factors enter into any complete analysis.</p> <p>CFA Institute agrees, and that\u2019s why this year everyone who sits the Level I exam will find an\u00a0added reading on ESG in addition to many others. It\u2019s on the test because it matters: Imagine a company that fits your investment criteria but has a board packed with the CEO\u2019s cousins. Or maybe revenue is growing much faster than costs, but the company releases no information about how it sources its materials.</p> <p>Why would you ignore that?</p> <p>I picked extreme examples for the sake of brevity, but they\u2019re not impossible. And it\u2019s hard enough to generate investment ideas, so it makes sense that nearly a quarter of respondents pay attention to this data by default. A further 16% of respondents gave the quite reasonable answer that their level of attention depends, since the information can be low quality or priced in.</p> <p>This is true of information in general.</p> <p>Another\u00a015% of poll participants likely think that writing this up was a waste of time, that ESG\u00a0material consists of nonfinancial information, which for such a\u00a0cohort qualifies as non-important.</p> <p>So I\u2019d like to close by sharing some additional evidence that there is a link between strong performance on ESG factors and what investors care about by definition: generating cash from business activity.</p> <ul> <li>The vast majority of\u00a0more than 2,200 studies reviewed by Gunnar Friede, Timo Busch, and Alexander Bassen show a positive association between ESG factors and corporate financial performance.</li> <li>Of the studies reviewed by Gordon Clark, Andreas Feiner, and Michael Viehs, 88% demonstrated that companies with robust sustainability practices had better operational performance, which translates into cash flow.</li> <li>An excellent 2012 study by Mark Fulton, Bruce M. Kahn, and Camilla Sharples states \u201cWe were surprised by the clarity of the results we uncovered.\u201d All of the 100-plus studies they reviewed found that companies with high ratings for corporate social responsibility have a lower cost of capital.</li> </ul> <p>Those studies say other things too, and are well worth a read. But those excerpts should give a good sense that there is at least the outline of an alpha opportunity to be had by looking at ESG data.</p> <p>But translating that opportunity into performance is difficult. Just take it from someone who\u2019s done it: David Blood, a founder of Generation Investment Management, notes that he is reluctant to talk about performance \u201cIn some respects because [he is] suspicious.\u201d And it\u2019s appropriate for you to hold that same suspicion.</p> <p>It might be worth examining your suspicion more closely if this passage from a 2015 Morgan Stanley report on sustainable investing has no effect on it (emphasis theirs).</p> <p>\u201cWe reviewed a range of studies on sustainable investment performance and examined performance data for 10,228 open-end mutual funds and 2,874 Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) based in the United States and denominated in US dollars. In the scope of our review, we ultimately found that investing in sustainability has usually met, and often exceeded, the performance of comparable traditional investments. This is on both an absolute and a risk-adjusted basis, across asset classes and over time.\u201c</p> <p>That\u2019s not the end of the discussion, but it does move it along. To me, it means that there is room to consider a sustainable approach to investing alongside value investing or statistical arbitrage as a tool that a professional investor can use to generate alpha.</p> <p>Whether you go out and do it is up to you. If you\u2019d like to, CFA Institute has\u00a0plenty of information to help.</p>","tags":["investment research","environmental markets","esg investing","talks"]},{"location":"blog/2016/09/08/how-finance-can-build-a-better-world/","title":"How Finance Can Build a Better World","text":"<p>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it in the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>To think about how financial professionals can change the world, think first about how far we\u2019ve come.</p> <p>I\u2019m fond of reminding readers that it was once a fringe idea to examine accounting information and derive something of value for the investment decision-making process.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t arrive at modern best practices because a factor model fell out of a tree onto the head of a sleeping investor. The profession of investment management has developed over time through an iterative process where people tried different things, many of which were once considered too far from the mainstream to be taken seriously.</p> <p>What\u2019s weird today that will seem obvious tomorrow? It\u2019s a great question to ask yourself semi-regularly. There is little to lose from paying attention to the fringes of human knowledge.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot there.</p> <p>You can study existential risk, learn how to teach an algorithm creativity, or maybe just keep it simple and think about the knock-on effects of the investments you make. Capital is a powerful thing. It would be foolish to ignore the role that your decisions play in the broader world.</p> <p>Especially when there is so much good to be done. For evidence of that, consider the documentary Living on One Dollar, which records the difficulties that a few Westerners faced trying to live as Guatemalan locals do. One of the more telling bits of the program was when the conversation shifted to a common financial objective among rural Guatemalans: stove ownership.</p> <p>The wrong thing to take away from that is \u201cOh, all they need are stoves!\u201d The question worth asking is: \u201cWhat if they could get a loan?\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t discount the potential of credit access.</p> <p>Extending credit to underserved communities is one of those easy-to-say, hard-to-do things that is full of controversy. Collecting interest payments from impoverished borrowers is a source of concern that raises challenging questions about the trade-offs between short-term profits and long-term prosperity. Additionally, studies have shown that this kind of activity, broadly described as microlending, is not the most effective way to end global poverty.</p> <p>However, the expansion of credit offered by microlending has had some notable benefits expanding labor options, boosting business size, and helping families manage their budgets. Access to credit has improved the choices available to global consumers earning and spending money, and these options would not have been explored without the work of microfinance pioneers such as Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank.</p> <p>By considering economic incentives from a different perspective, Yunus was able to develop a business model that functioned at the intersection of capitalism and social responsibility.\u00a0He will elaborate on these themes in his keynote address, \u201cRedesigning Economics to Redesign the World,\u201d at the 2016 European Investment Conference.</p> <p>How big an\u00a0influence\u00a0Yunus\u2019s model and microlending in general will have on alleviating global poverty remains uncertain, but the insight and innovation that motivated their development represent the sort of thinking that can truly make finance a force for good.</p> <p>We could use more of it.</p>","tags":["idea generation","investment industry","economic development"]},{"location":"blog/2016/09/16/how-to-profit-from-a-crisis/","title":"How to Profit From a Crisis","text":"<p>Everyone is about to lose a lot of money, but do what I say and you won\u2019t!</p> <p>Somewhere in that sentence is the ultimate pitch. It\u2019s nothing if not a call to adventure, and even better: It offers you the chance to be smarter than the folks next door. For some, it\u2019s just the allure of being right while others are wrong that makes crisis-inflected analysis so compelling.</p> <p>For others, it\u2019s making money. I probably do not need to remind you of John Paulson\u2019s 2007 payday. No doubt: Make the right call, stick to it, and the rest of your life changes. You\u2019ll be sought out as an oracle amid the crisis, and for sure the people who didn\u2019t listen will write in to say they wish they did.</p> <p>If you ever find yourself thinking this way, it\u2019s time for a vacation.</p> <p>I\u2019m not just ripping on the bears here. A creative professional in today\u2019s market will find no shortage of reasons to be legitimately worried about the outlook for risk assets. If you\u2019re following along at home: They also go down.</p> <p>The word \u201ccrisis\u201d is nightmare fuel enough to produce a career\u2019s worth of bad decisions though. With discussion blossoming\u00a0about whether Deutsche Bank will produce another \u201cLehman moment,\u201d I figured I could usefully round up some crisis thinking for your examination.</p> <p>I\u2019ve summarized three books below that each offer its own flavor of apocalyptic investing. One of them I recommend. The hope is that reading over the list will keep you mindful of the sometimes narrow line between thesis and theology.</p> <p>But first, I\u2019ve got two words for you:</p> <p>Heirloom Seeds</p> <p>If you believe a doomsday crisis is around the corner and you are interested in generating robust returns from it, even well-collateralized exchange-traded products might not be the way to go. Heirloom seeds, which are cheap and can be used to create more of themselves, are your best bet for a store of value</p> <p>Options cost money, and if it\u2019s Deutsche Bank that\u00a0has\u00a0you worried, you can only get puts going two years out. You\u2019re better than that.</p> <p>Create an option to manufacture food amid the wreckage instead. You\u2019ll coast without paying theta for years, and if you happen to buy the seeds on a credit card with a promotional 0% rate, it gets even better: If the world ends before the offer expires, your rate of return is infinite.</p> <p>If you\u2019re skeptical, consider what the going rate for a fresh heirloom tomato is likely to be after Armageddon. Even if at the end of five years you throw all your seeds out the window in disgust, you might still get a radish out of it a few weeks later.</p> <p>Try that with a financial instrument. Probably these alpha spouters are outside your mandate, and that\u2019s exactly the point. It\u2019s almost like considerations of crisis don\u2019t have a place in the realm of professional activity.</p> <p>Only they do.</p> <p>Not for nothing, when you ask late-career investment professionals what\u00a0quality\u00a0they\u2019d like to pass on to the next generation, a very common response is \u201ca sense of financial market history.\u201d</p> <p>There has been no shortage of financial scandals, scoundrels, and crises over the years, and knowing what\u2019s happened in the past can help you avoid bad, simplifying assumptions in the future. I\u2019ll never forget the response I got from a trader in 2007 when I asked him to assess the probability Lehman Brothers would stop making a market in some securities my firm owned for clients. \u201cThey\u2019ll never do it\u201d he said. \u201cIf they did, they\u2019d never get another to underwrite.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s weirdly possible to be both entirely right and completely wrong when handicapping a crisis.</p> <p>With all that preamble established, let\u2019s look at some books (in reverse chronological order).</p> <p>How You Can Profit from the Coming Devaluation. 1970. Harry Browne.</p> <p>\u201cThe lending of demand deposits causes inflation\u201d is the key sentence in this work, which argues Keynesian economic policies lead, by definition, to the debasement of currency. This book came at an important time, as my colleague Ron Rimkus, CFA, puts it, right before President Richard Nixon sold the world fiat money in 1971.</p> <p>Browne deserves some credit: Inflation did pick up significantly a few years after this\u00a0was published, amid the so-called \u201cGreat Inflation.\u201d Among economists, there\u2019s still some debate as to why this period of high peacetime inflation happened. Allan H. Meltzer of the US Federal Reserve somewhat vindicated Browne in 2005, arguing that \u201cwidespread acceptance of the simple Keynesian model with its implication that monetary and fiscal policy should be coordinated. In practice, that meant that the Federal Reserve financed a large part of the fiscal deficit.\u201d</p> <p>Browne recommended a combination of cash in dollars (a month\u2019s expenses), converting savings to Swiss francs and placing them overseas, owning $250 or more in silver coins as well as silver bullion through a Swiss bank, and creating your own retreat in an area full of \u201cself-sufficient and individualistic\u201d people for maximum safety.</p> <p>I\u2019ll leave it to you to research how those recommendations performed.</p> <p>Beat the Millennium Crash: How Profit from the Coming Financial Crisis. 1999.\u00a0Jake Bernstein.</p> <p>With a trader\u2019s sensibility, Bernstein compares the predicament\u00a0of an investor at the start of the millennium to that of someone in a crowded movie theater just before the audience\u00a0notices there is a fire. Noting speculative excesses in markets around the world, Bernstein maintains that markets are headed for a fall and the Y2K bug is just another reason why they are\u00a0about to plunge over the cliff.</p> <p>This\u00a0is another reminder of how it\u2019s possible to be right and wrong at the same time. Bernstein spends a lot of time analyzing the negative implications of a Y2K crisis, which did not actually happen. But his statement that the top may not happen exactly on 1 January 2000 was perhaps over-hedged. The peak in the S&amp;P 500 came on 24 March 2000.</p> <p>Bernstein recommended reducing holdings of stocks to about 10% of a portfolio, adding a 20% allocation to precious metals and equivalents, holding 40% in cash, 15% in real estate, and 15% in collectibles. As before, I\u2019ll leave it to you to assess performance, though one imagines Bernstein had a pretty good start to the millennium.</p> <p>How to Profit from the Coming Rapture. 2008.\u00a0Steve and Evie Levy.</p> <p>I\u2019ll initiate the discussion with a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating: This is a classic.</p> <p>Let me just excerpt the first few sentences of the foreword:</p> <p>The Rapture is coming.</p> <p>The Tribulation, a horrifying nightmare of bloodshed and destruction, will follow.</p> <p>And that means one thing: investment opportunities!\u201d</p> <p>The Levys proceed to lay out a framework for entrepreneurship in a world of unfolding tribulations, where the medium of exchange has shifted to canned tuna and beans. They even create helpful charts, which they invite us to use for our own calculations.</p> <p>One More Thing</p> <p>Before\u00a0moving\u00a0on to the other recommended reading material, I need to warn you about something: This article contains snark, which carries with it the risk of assuming that our own investment programs are better thought through and documented than those discussed, which were transmitted in full-length books.</p> <p>Do not make that assumption. The problem with putting an investment thesis in a book is its permanence: Dow 36,000, for instance, has not aged well. But the benefit is that the authors have been forced to think about what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re doing it with enough precision to communicate that information. All of us have something to learn about the communication end of investing.</p> <p>There are a lot of potential opinions you\u00a0can have, but defining those you take action on is important. That way you can stick to them. Remember what happened to Harry Browne: His runaway inflation actually materialized, but that happened a few years after the publication of his book. The chart below shows how $100 invested in gold on 31 December\u00a01969 would have performed over the following decade.</p> <p>So if you\u2019re thinking about doing something unusual in response to a crisis, make sure and ask yourself how long you\u2019ll be able to stick with it.</p> <p>Read These, Learn Something</p> <ul> <li>\u201cA brief history of chairs.\u201d (The Paris Review)</li> <li>A visual guide to neural nets.

And personally, I\u2019m tired of hearing about the rumored death of something immortal.</p> <p>Critics of private equity are not hard to find, and if you listen to them long enough, you\u2019ll hear all kinds of stories that make your stomach turn. No doubt, there have been bad actors abusing the label of \u201cprivate equity investment.\u201d</p> <p>But private equity is a governance structure, not a business model or industry. As Zeisberger defines it, the format encompasses activities that go by many names \u2014 venture capital, growth equity, leveraged buyouts \u2014 the list goes on a while, depending on how retro you\u2019d like to get with your jargon.</p> <p>Despite the various challenges faced by each form of private equity investment, private companies need money now and will need it in the future. And on the other side of the equation, there can be attractive incentives for supplying capital. Ted Eliopoulos, the Chief Investment Officer of CalPERS, summed it up in a 2015 investment committee meeting: \u201cCurrently, private equity is the only asset class in our portfolio that is expected to exceed our seven and a half percent target rate of return on a net basis.\u201d</p> <p>Here are a couple of reasons why there are solid opportunities within the broad category of private equity:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Accessing the right opportunities. Investors in developed markets are used to allocating capital through liquid, well diversified public markets. In China, India, and Japan, the top ten firms represented 18%, 27%, and 17% of the country\u2019s total market capitalization. In Nigeria, Peru, and Columbia, the top ten firms represent 72%, 72%, and 71% of market capitalization. To access the most exciting components of a country\u2019s economic story, an investor will need to go private.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeatable returns. Alternatives are always Rorschach Tests to some degree, and critics will suggest that private equity returns are only repeatable when capital markets provide a source of cheap leverage. But you can\u2019t get leverage without some kind of return stream, and there is evidence that private managers add value. Citing a study on value creation from the Center for Entrepreneurial and Financial Studies and Capital Dynamics, Zeisberger noted that operational value creation accounts for almost three quarters of unlevered returns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Idiosyncrasies. It can be hard to analyze investments from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective, especially when considering a massive asset class that spans the earliest to latest stages of a company\u2019s life cycle. But remember: most private equity firms are composed of curious, hardworking people trying to do things differently from their competition. Some will succeed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s not all sunshine and carried interest from here on out. The same set of concerns that apply elsewhere in investing \u2014 slowing growth, pricey assets, and intensifying competition \u2014 accompany private equity. Zeisberger noted that 96% of investors surveyed by Coller Capital saw high asset prices as a headwind for private equity prices in the coming three to five years.</p> <p>Private equity firms can add value to the companies they invest in and engage with, but it won\u2019t be easy or automatic. Despite those hurdles, 88% of investors surveyed by Prequin at the start of 2016 expected to commit the same amount of capital or more to private equity this year as they had in the previous year.</p> <p>Overall, the death of private equity has more in common with the long-rumored death of Abe Vigoda than an actual mortality event.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["private equity","investment industry"]},{"location":"blog/2016/10/27/mergers-send-a-message/","title":"Mergers Send a Message","text":"<p>I first wrote this essay for CFA Institute and published it on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>They don\u2019t usually ring a bell at the top of the market, but every once in a while somebody up and buys Time Warner.</p> <p>If there was ringing in your ears when you heard the news, you\u2019re not alone.</p> <p>And neither are Time Warner or AT&amp;T.

One great example comes in the form of a book I have sitting on my desk: Merger Mania by Ivan Boesky.</p> <p>A contemporary review from the former editor of Mergers &amp;\u00a0Acquisitions offers the following choice quotes:</p> <p>\u201cBoesky hopes to end the \u2018tall tales\u2019 about his profession by showing its calculated methods while warning that no single book can teach them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd although the probabilities of completion versus sellout are calculations intrinsic to the arbitrageurs decision to invest, Boesky never discusses how to come up with such numbers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis silent slap, more than the economic indignities of tender offers denounced in the book\u2019s conclusions, shows the worst side of hostile takeovers: CEO\u2019s inhumanity to CEO.\u201d\u00a0(This refers to a phone call that was not returned.)</p> <p>The last one is a reminder of the special form of myopic ego that can be present alongside, in addition to, or in place of a compelling reason to affect a merger. After receipt of a bid, a management team finds itself using a rarefied, intermediated, and hopefully sexless version of Tinder. There is a straightforward obligation to shop the company around, and selling yourself can be less than dignified. The horror.</p> <p>The actual worst side of large deals is difficult to fully describe. For starters, there\u2019s a lot of money sloshing around to attract unethical actors like Boesky. Almost\u00a0immediately after publishing\u00a0Merger Mania, he paid a $100-million fine for\u00a0insider trading and eventually received a\u00a0three-year jail sentence. The\u00a0SEC\u2019s historical society does a nice write-up.</p> <p>Barring the cloak-and-dagger stuff, big deals are still scary. Heath Ledger, as the Joker. lays out why as well as any professional ever could in The Dark Knight: \u201cIt\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s about sending a message.\u201d</p> <p>What if management\u2019s motivation has more to do with building the biggest something than executing a strategy? Think about buying clothes for a minute: Activity can be easily and expensively confused for progress. Our desire to make sense of things can lead us to build a sophisticated narrative for manic, short-term decisions. Later in the film, the Joker compares himself to a dog chasing cars: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do with one if I caught it!\u201d</p> <p>General vs. Specific</p> <p>If you\u2019ve read this far, you might well think I could never be among the 14% of respondents who think these announcements are sensible and great news, or the 12% who feel they are just what the market needs to move further up the wall of worry.</p> <p>But all I have done is show you the straw man in M&amp;A that everyone hates and nobody wants to be.</p> <p>Investment bankers know about these stories too, and have more of them. The thing is: I can make whatever general case I want about M&amp;A and the risks involved, but specifics win this sort of argument every time.</p> <p>What message are you getting from these mergers? Share your thoughts in the comments below, please! I find myself remembering that there are returns to the size of your platform in media and content that are outstanding, yet hard to understand from the outside. It would be nice to see the pessimist\u2019s arrogance defeated in this case, and indeed I am left wondering how many of the folks who are scared by these deals consider themselves contrarian.</p> <p>I look forward to any thoughts you may have.</p>","tags":["mergers","economic geography","attention economy"]},{"location":"blog/2016/11/04/in-search-of-meaning/","title":"In Search of Meaning","text":"<p>I wrote this for CFA Institute right after I decided to come out publicly as a Transgender Woman. It was first publshed on the Enterprising Investor. </p> <p>Are you working on the biggest, most interesting problem that you can think of?</p> <p>If not, why not?</p> <p>If you are lucky, that question \u2014 lifted from Richard Hamming\u2019s excellent talk, \u201cYou and Your Research\u201d \u2014 will plague you for the rest of your life. Call it fear of missing out or fear of resting easy, either way it is a powerful motivator.</p> <p>Just as in the spring, the thoughts of young people turn to romance, in the fall they seem to turn to meaning. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve had a number of conversations with friends new and old about that \u201cM\u201d word.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much agreement on what it means.</p> <p>Cruel Irony</p> <p>Maturing is a process with steps: Those most widely agreed upon are paying taxes and making compromises. I assume there are others, and that time will make them all the more obvious. In the meantime though, it\u2019s worth thinking in detail about the compromises in your life, both personal and professional.</p> <p>Our lives are complex systems, and we need to analyze them as such. That\u2019s not an easy thing, but you can gain\u00a0a lot of insight\u00a0by thinking about the different places where it is possible to intervene in a system. At best, you will identify the issue and come up with a plan at the same time.</p> <p>I\u2019m not aware of a better way of thinking across the different levels of a system than the framework offered by Donella Meadows\u00a0excerpted below:</p> <p>Places to Intervene in a System </p> <p>(in increasing order of effectiveness)</p> <p>12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).</p> <p>11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.</p> <p>10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).</p> <p>9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.</p> <p>8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.</p> <p>7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.</p> <p>6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).</p> <p>5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).</p> <p>4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structures.</p> <p>3. The goals of the system.</p> <p>2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system \u2014 its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters \u2014 arises.</p> <p>1. The power to transcend paradigms.</p> <p>Now, that\u2019s quite\u00a0a list. But think about how it can help you uncover possible issues and move toward addressing them. If you\u2019re having trouble getting up in the morning, you could put a coffeemaker next to your bed (change a constant, number 12). Or you could take a deeper look at why the day seems unappealing.</p> <p>You can try and reinvent yourself by looking at the feedback loops you\u2019re involved in. Tweaking how you reward yourself can be powerful, but to me what\u2019s cool about this list is that once you finish thinking about feedback loops, you are only halfway there.</p> <p>The Personal Is Professional</p> <p>A great thing about working at CFA Institute is that much of what I do targets numbers 1 and 2. As part of that work, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the past few months thinking about our profession and its purpose in general.</p> <p>In talking to people about their work, there is widespread optimism for the activity of investing, but a profound sense of ennui. The work can feel abstract, or perhaps the work is great but there are tough-to-overcome structural impediments to serving clients as fully as you would like. To a degree,\u00a0CFA Institute and State Street recently quantified this\u00a0with findings that suggest an association between a professional\u2019s motivation and their performance.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but feel that change is needed higher up the spectrum. Ultimately, the prevailing business model for investing is \u201cWe hold onto your stuff and tell you what happened to it.\u201d</p> <p>This was compelling at one time, but today diversification is not nearly as hard to achieve as it was when funds first came into vogue. We\u2019ve continued to deliver services primarily using funds of various types though, and as a result our offerings are unexciting to many even as we innovate furiously within the form.</p> <p>I would love it if you were to think for a moment on how the power to transcend paradigms might be applied in your life, whether personal or professional. In revisiting your core assumptions, can you find the place where you\u2019re irretrievably wrong?

It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the funny thing about turning over a new leaf: You can do it whenever you want.</p> <p>Life can start at 0, 15, 30, 60, or 90. You decide when. Nobody else will.</p> <p>But there\u2019s no denying that the coming of a new calendar year is a prompt to look ahead. We hope, we wonder, and in theory, we improve ourselves. There is always a gap between theory and practice though, and the intention of this essay is to explore ways to close it. We talk a lot about goals in this industry, but often in an overtly normative way: Meet your liabilities, save for retirement, buy a house.</p> <p>Identifying a goal, making plans to achieve it, and then sticking to the program is hard enough when the goal is small and you really want to do it. Around this time last year, a lot of people said things like \u201cI want to learn to make pasta from scratch,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to go running every morning.\u201d I was one of them.</p> <p>A New Year\u2019s resolution of mine that recurred for years was to remember lunch.</p> <p>I came close. I hope you are wondering what could possibly make that so\u00a0hard. There are at least five restaurants within a two-minute walk of our office\u2019s front door, and New York City has nothing if not plenty of delivery options.</p> <p>Deficit Versus Difference</p> <p>A better question is why this goal even exists: I get the most done on days when I skip lunch.</p> <p>I know this because I\u2019ve been tracking my productivity with RescueTime for nearly a decade. But it\u2019s not \u201cLunch is for wimps!\u201d machismo that keeps me from predictably pillaging the sandwich bars of Midtown, it\u2019s ADHD. I am susceptible to hyperfocusing on problems that interest me. Fortunately these problems are often work related. And even though I knew this, I spent a tremendous amount of time and energy trying to make it go away.</p> <p>Now would be a good time to consider\u00a0how the way we talk about goals as a profession might produce similar effects in the minds of our clients. There is nothing wrong with a good retirement plan, but what if clients believe they are fundamentally less complete as human beings without one that changes. Think about the last 10 financial ads you saw. How many featured active seniors, a boat, perhaps a grandchild?</p> <p>It\u2019s not that these aren\u2019t lovely things, and there is nothing wrong with marketing your products. But there is a risk of imposing objectives that suit our business models onto our clients that cannot be credibly dismissed.</p> <p>Put Yourself in Their Shoes</p> <p>I think that a New Year\u2019s resolution is a special thing in every case, but for people who work in a field organized around the goals of others, it presents an unusually full opportunity for introspection.</p> <p>My last Weekend Reads focused on techniques you can use to find meaningful actions, mainly a compelling way of examining where exactly you would like to intervene. This one, I hope, has provided an invitation to think seriously about what it is that goals are and are not. They are personal. They are not guessable.</p> <p>Fortunately, you have an opportunity to cultivate a productive empathy: Try to learn something new and pay disciplined attention to what helped you the most. My guess is that it will almost never be an instruction manual.</p> <p>Since we are heading toward\u00a0the end of 2016, I\u2019ve collected a number of different books that might provide a jumping-off point to the New Year:</p> <ul> <li>The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich\u00a0by Timothy Ferriss.</li> <li>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity\u00a0by David Allen.</li> <li>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\u00a0by Stephen R.

It's one of the essays that remains most important to me. It was written for CFA Institute and first published on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Fees are like mosquitoes: They\u2019re everywhere, nobody has anything positive to say about them, and most people don\u2019t know why they exist.</p> <p>Some in the investment management industry strongly agree and aren\u2019t afraid to talk about it. Over the years, I have seen at least five well-regarded hedge fund managers say something along the lines of,\u00a0\u201cThere are 10,000 hedge funds. Only about 500 are adding value to their clients.\u201d</p> <p>We also need to look at the fees some of our cousins in the banking industry are assessing with seeming impunity.</p> <p>I know this because when I did, I found a combination of market failure, moral outrage, and missed opportunity.</p> <p>Meet Janice</p> <p>Janice is an imaginary friend of mine. She is single, has no kids, and worked\u00a0a full 40 hours every week in 2016\u00a0at a small shop on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, one of the five boroughs of New York City. Since her employer is a small business, she earned the $9-an-hour\u00a0minimum wage, $18,720 total for the year.</p> <p>After deducting taxes and making conservative estimates of what she needs to spend every year on rent, food, health insurance, clothing, and so on, I estimate Janice has about $4,570 a year in \u201cdiscretionary\u201d income. That\u2019s $380.83 a month.</p> <p>I won\u2019t talk you through the model because you can inspect it directly, but I have likely significantly overstated her financial flexibility.</p> <p>For simplicity, I assumed she never dines out, has an emergency, or spends money on entertainment. She will eventually develop\u00a0scurvy\u00a0thanks to the diet I used to estimate her food costs. She has also managed to secure an apartment in New York City for $468 a month.</p> <p>Say whatever you want about my analysis, but I\u2019m not being too tough.</p> <p>Not Enough Money for a Bank</p> <p>Well over half \u2014 or 57.4% \u2014\u00a0of unbanked Americans cite not having enough money as the reason they have not opened a bank account, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\u00a0Janice is one of\u00a0them. This is not without reason.</p> <p>New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer, has produced a tool intended to help low-income New Yorkers find bank accounts and to estimate the annual cost of holding one. The comptroller\u2019s estimate is reasonable but also quite conservative. It includes one overdraft a year and accounts for the effect of a low, fluctuating balance. I took the data presented there and with the help of a research assistant from Perssist, focused just on those listed banks with branch locations in the Bronx. As above, you can inspect this work directly.</p> <p>If Janice were to randomly pick a bank in the Bronx, she can expect her\u00a0account to require $92 per year in cash, 81% of which ($75) will go towards some kind of fee. That is about 1.5% of her \u201cdiscretionary\u201d income.\u00a0If she were to walk into the first bank branch she saw on the street, I expect the cost would be substantially higher: $139 a year, 85% ($118) of which will go to some kind of fee. That is about 2.5% of her \u201cdiscretionary\u201d income.</p> <p>She is well aware of this figure, and that is why she hasn\u2019t opened a bank account. Unfortunately, she\u2019s not aware of the comprehensive cost of her alternatives.</p> <p>Secret Taxes</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have a bank account in the United States, you might use a check-cashing service and a prepaid debit card instead.</p> <p>A check-cashing service puts its own capital at risk when clearing a check, so\u00a0naturally it seeks to earn a return. In New York, the fee the services can charge is\u00a0capped at 2.01%\u00a0of the value of the check, but that still means Janice pays a total of $316 a year to access her funds, which is 6.9% of her discretionary income.</p> <p>This is 31% more than she pays for health insurance, and she\u2019s paying it just to use money she has already earned.</p> <p>She also has a prepaid debit card for online purchases and for\u00a0convenience. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CPFB) gave\u00a0her a small amount of protection after the \u201ccatastrophic system failure\u201d of one prepaid card provider drew attention to this fast-growing sector and its customers\u2019 remarkable lack of recourse.</p> <p>In researching these cards, I learned about fees I had never\u00a0imagined. There are balance inquiry fees and 32 line fee tables. Of course, not all of the cards\u00a0function this way, but separating the wheat from the chaff is a Sisyphean task. I have a reasonable claim to financial expertise, yet I\u00a0am not sure how I would begin to estimate the full costs of some of these services.</p> <p>Not Just Janice</p> <p>In the Corporation for Enterprise Development\u2019s (CFED) 2014 estimation, Bronx County is the second-most underbanked county with more than 100,000 residents in the United States. The CFED estimates that 20.8% of its residents do not have a bank account, and 27.2% are \u201cunderbanked,\u201d meaning that they have a bank account but still rely on a mix of financial services to fulfill their needs.</p> <p>Separately, the Urban Institute produced slightly higher estimates in 2015. It pegs the combined percentage of unbanked and underbanked Bronx households at 52.3%. Remember, the Bronx is\u00a0an 11-mile drive from the New York Stock Exchange.</p> <p>When I first joined CFA Institute, I contributed to some research on the fees of variable annuities. The highest upfront sales charge permitted on these instruments by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) is 8.5%, but this fee is assessed on investment capital.</p> <p>Because Janice is subject to such substantial fees before she can even amass investment capital, the possibility that she ever will is reduced. This is no one organization\u2019s\u00a0fault, but it is wrong.</p> <p>Lessons from Mumbai</p> <p>I am doing\u00a0a rotation in our Mumbai office, and the comparison is striking.\u00a0India is moving light years ahead of the United States when it comes to providing banking access to the poor, and the country\u2019s example is worth paying attention to.</p> <p>In August 2014, the government introduced a plan called the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana\u00a0(PMJDY, Scheme for People\u2019s Wealth) that provides not just free bank accounts to all citizens, but also free overdraft insurance. In a country where about 17% of the country is Dalit (\u201cUntouchable\u201d) and faces profound discrimination, the government recognizes that a bank account is a pathway to personal autonomy.</p> <p>Prime Minister Narendra\u00a0Modi nails it when he refers to the unbanked as financial untouchables. If you think wealth creation is good and want it to happen, freeing the unbanked where you find them is an obvious step.</p> <p>How long will New York City remain a leading financial center if its own residents can\u2019t obtain\u00a0decent bank accounts?</p>","tags":["fees","economic development","income inequality","india"]},{"location":"blog/2017/02/03/seeing-with-bad-data/","title":"Seeing With Bad Data","text":"<p>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Many\u00a0people believe they know a lot about the world.

Until next time, have a great weekend.</p> <ul> <li>Inside the debate on a universal basic income in India.</li> <li>\u201cVending Machines to Revolutionize the Way we have a Cuppa.\u201d</li> <li>The \u201cRising Popularity of Indian Restaurants in Britain.\u201c</li> <li>\u201cFlat earth music\u201d is a thing.</li> </ul>","tags":["india","idea generation","investment research","maps"]},{"location":"blog/2017/02/09/whats-the-difference-between-emerging-and-frontier-markets/","title":"What\u2019s the Difference between Emerging and Frontier Markets?","text":"<p>Here\u2019s the thing about labels: They always tell you more about the people who apply them than what they are applied to.</p> <p>Take \u201cemerging market.\u201d It is one of the few terms that applies uncontroversially to both India and China.</p> <p>These are not similar places. Business travelers from one have been known to check bags full of bottled water when visiting the other. That\u2019s not something you do when heading somewhere just like home.</p> <p>But this shouldn\u2019t surprise because labels like \u201cemerging\u201d and \u201cfrontier\u201d market are not sociological in the least. Applied by\u00a0FTSE and MSCI on behalf of global investors, they concern only the investability of a market.</p> <p>But how can we break down such broad terms? To find out, we polled readers of CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief to see what they thought most distinguishes an emerging from a frontier market.</p> <p>In your view, which of the following most separates a \u201cfrontier\u201d from an \u201cemerging\u201d market?</p> <p></p> <p>* Results do not add up to 100% due to rounding.</p> <p>Of the five options, quality of financial information led the pack, with 32% of the 497 respondents selecting it as the most critical factor. The absolute size of capital markets came in a close second with 30% of the vote. This makes sense: Investors need good information to make decisions. But for the information to be worth digesting, it must concern a sufficiently large opportunity.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not like all emerging markets are paragons of transparency. Or that such qualities are easily measurable. The \u201cdeveloped\u201d United States ranks well below Russia on the World Bank\u2019s Extent of Corporate Transparency Index, which measures how openly business is conducted in each country\u00a0based on disclosures about company ownership, executive compensation, whether financial statements are audited, and so on. The average score in the MSCI emerging markets index was 6.21, which is only .48 higher than in frontier markets, which averaged 5.73. The United States scored 5.4, which is lower than both China\u2019s 9 and India\u2019s 6.</p> <p>This likely says more about the need to look at multiple indicators to make these distinctions than anything else.</p> <p>What about the size of the market? After all, only a genuinely odd investor would get excited about meticulously governed companies with perfect disclosure that are too small to build a meaningful position in. Even if it were 100% certain that the value of every public company listed in Mauritius was going to double, many wouldn\u2019t get out of bed to invest there. At about $7.25 billion in total value, the market is just too small.</p> <p>A country looking to move up in the eyes of global investors can\u2019t necessarily push its GDP that much higher \u2014 even changing how it\u2019s counted has limits \u2014\u00a0but it likely can boost its ratio of listed companies to GDP. Frontier countries have an average market capitalization that is 36% of their GDP, while emerging economies have 64% of GDP in market capitalization, on average. This is skewed by extremes though: Take out the three emerging economies with the largest capital markets and the three smallest frontier economies, and they\u2019re just about the same.</p> <p>What about the rest of these metrics?</p> <p>To see how ease of doing business associated with index membership, I examined a statistic that says a lot about a country\u2019s business environment: the cost of enforcing a contract as a percentage of its value.</p> <p>The average is identical for emerging and frontier markets \u2014\u00a029% \u2014and\u00a0it isn\u2019t as distorted by outliers as I assumed when I first looked at my spreadsheet and blinked.</p> <p>I guess that\u2019s why it was the least popular choice. The other two choices concern breadth of financial services offerings and access to them, and rather than discuss them here, I invite you down a rabbit hole of further exploration. Rethinking Financial Deepening: Stability and Growth in Emerging Markets is an excellent place to start. It introduces a financial deepening index that can help you better understand the role of finance in these economies. Thanks to my colleague Shreenivas Kunte, CFA, for the recommendation.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that I\u2019ve taken a descriptive approach here, but it\u2019s also possible to take an opportunistic one. My colleague Larry Cao, CFA, posted an excellent summary of a book that will help you evaluate the opportunity sets in these various countries and how they change over time.</p>","tags":["emerging markets","frontier markets","language analysis","economic geography"]},{"location":"blog/2017/03/10/adapting-to-india/","title":"Adapting to India","text":"<p>There\u2019s a place in Mumbai called Dhobi Ghat. It\u2019s a\u00a0nearly 2.5-acre open-air laundry\u00a0that offers a site for compelling photos, a glimpse of the old Bombay, and an opportunity to place your understanding of India on a shaky foundation.</p> <p>\u201cGuidebooks will tell you this place is essential to Mumbai,\u201d my colleague Vidhu Shekhar, CFA, told me. \u201cAnd maybe that used to be true, but people have washing machines now.\u201d</p> <p>A fast-growing country will change more quickly than the guidebooks that describe it. But tourists are likely to visit places they have heard about from people like themselves. What is true for mutual funds, content, or consumer products is true for tourist destinations: Usage is driven by distribution.</p> <p>So my invitation to you this weekend is straightforward: Try to understand the landmass of India and forget about the country for a moment.</p> <p>A Cacophony of Civilizations</p> <p>Language comes in a number of flavors here. India has nearly 900,\u00a0and many of their words are\u00a0not translatable\u00a0into English. Apart from piquing our interest,\u00a0the cultural diversity this produces is breathtaking.</p> <p>And think about this: At least five of these languages \u2014 Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, and Tamil \u2014\u00a0have 50-million native speakers\u00a0in India alone. There are\u00a022 languages enumerated in the Indian constitution, and the\u00a0majority of Indians have a mother tongue other than Hindi.</p> <p>The territorial history of India over the last 5,000 years serves as a metaphor of the breadth of life experience on the subcontinent. (And there are scientists who think civilization in India is much older than described.)</p> <p>The appropriate comparison for the region\u2019s historically volatile borders and varied linguistic backgrounds is Europe. It wouldn\u2019t be a waste of time to look at the global history\u00a0of political borders as well.</p> <p>A caution: The last Weekend Reads I wrote warned about assuming\u00a0maps are fact. And it\u2019s worth noting that even the territories described therein are opinions.</p> <p>Truth Is Relative</p> <p>I once gave an intern a seemingly trivial assignment: Find India\u2019s unemployment rate.</p> <p>The challenge of this is straightforward. You can create a number, but what concept of employment do you measure? Some global measures\u00a0explicitly disclaim that their intent is to measure a specific, well-educated urban segment of the population, which is possible.</p> <p>But there is a risk of focusing too much on \u201cpeople like us\u201d when looking at India. Neelkanth Mishra notes that as many as 90% of Indian workers are employed in the informal sector. How does one define employment in that area which appears to be thriving in spite of itself?</p> <p>So be wary of any data\u00a0that doesn\u2019t disclose both its sample size and sampling method. Arguably, some data issues are a residual of the intrinsic difficulty of measuring India, but some appear more intentional. Saurabh Mukherjea, CFA, offered what he calls \u201cpalliatives\u201d for this analytical problem in a recent note.</p> <p>Execution Is Possible (If You Know the Market)</p> <p>The immense success of McDonald\u2019s in India\u00a0shows it\u2019s possible for global brands to adapt here, but it is far from the norm. A 2007 study noted that firms historically have more luck entering China than India.</p> <p>Part of the problem is it seems easier to operate a global enterprise in India than it really is. English is widely spoken here, and the country is a massive cultural exporter. But the breadth of adaptation Amazon undertook\u00a0to compete here is telling. And McDonald\u2019s success aside, those companies recently exiting the market include Twitter, AstraZeneca, Telenor, and DreamWorks.</p> <p>What\u2019s true of global businesses is also true of global investment managers. A who\u2019s who of firms have tried and failed to expand here: Fidelity, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Nomura. The list goes on, with protecting profitability given as the reason.</p> <p>Yet the investment community thrives in its own way. I was at\u00a0a packed gathering\u00a0of the Indian Association of Investment Professionals\u00a0to hear Howard Marks, CFA. By my count there are 25 mutual fund complexes managing upwards of a billion dollars.

Me too.</p> <p>So how?</p> <p>When I Google \u201cget better at writing,\u201d the results page offers quite a number of different methods. Clearly, we have options. But there is a point of diminishing returns for writing tips.</p> <p>The most obvious component of the problem is that the world has unlimited tips and limited time. And even though there is no scoreboard in writing, it can seem a bit like success is reserved for those who have jumped through the right hoops.</p> <p>That\u2019s why, when Shreenivas Kunte, CFA, and I were designing writing seminars for members in India, we wanted to make it very clear that there is only one way to improve as a writer: to write.</p> <p>\u201cJust Do It.\u201d</p> <p>Any presentation about writing should have the words \u201cJust Write\u201d in 100-plus point font. Ours did. Hopefully, the groups we spoke to heard that message, but we also made sure that they did quite a bit of their own writing.</p> <p>One of the challenges with writing is that when you start, there won\u2019t be much of an audience paying attention to your work. A glimpse at an old Google Analytics account revealed that exactly two people read one of my early blog posts. I suspect they were my mom and dad.</p> <p>This is actually good because it prevents writers from being driven by external rewards. Writing is one of the most effective tools to explore and make tangible your own curiosity. However, one of the harder things about it is that there is an emotional rollercoaster at the center of the process. The paths by which you feel progress, make progress, and appear to be making progress could not be more different.</p> <p>I made a graph of this for you:</p> <p></p> <p>The qualitative sentiments expressed by this chart are best described by Ira Glass\u00a0and Stephen King. Few writers would disagree with Glass\u2019s suggestion that to get better, \u201cyou\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d</p> <p>I think you should follow any one of the tips mentioned above that appeals to you. But keep this in mind: Writing about investing is not hard, but it is complex and specialized. Not everything about writing, in general, will transfer tidily when the market enters into it.</p> <p>Even though the investment profession is full of writers who are motivated by their own curiosity, lots of investment writing is inspired by a desire to seem authoritative about what is happening in the market here and now. In addition to impossible, this is highly counterproductive!</p> <p>Make Meaning</p> <p>The best way to stick it out through the awkward phases is to make sure your writing matters to you. Writers like the pseudonymous Jesse Livermore behind Philosophical Economics would not be churning out the sort of insightful content that they do unless they were getting something out of it.\u00a0I suspect that something is the discovery process that comes free with a thoughtfully oriented writing process.</p> <p>What the writers I admire have in common is an orientation toward questions that seem likely to be relevant for the next quarter or year rather than the next news cycle.</p> <p></p> <p>Up to a point, the probability of creating deep insight increases with your timeframe. It steadily declines as one attempts to cram every piece of learning from an entire career into one blog post.</p> <p>Think about \u201cThe Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville.\u201d The author \u2014 Warren Buffett \u2014 is well known to many, and I would be among the hundreds who would eagerly read a distillation of everything he\u2019s learned over his career. Astute readers will note that he doesn\u2019t try to cram all that into his letters or his interviews. The audience could never keep track.</p> <p>The best writing is the fruit of a deep-seated curiosity, chipped away at through experience, and diligently offered to the reader after many edits. We spent most of the time in our writing workshops teaching how to give and receive feedback. I would be nowhere without the colleagues, friends, teachers, and family members who have politely told me to try again over the years.</p> <p>Tools to Write Better</p> <ul> <li>Analyze My Writing: A simple readability and content analyzer.</li> <li>The Most Dangerous Writing App: Don\u2019t stop writing or you\u2019ll lose everything.

Here\u2019s the first line:</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to pull punches: This year\u2019s 70th CFA Institute Annual Conference may be the best\u00a0Annual Conference.\u201d</p> <p>It came from Peter M.J. Gross, who does not italicize lightly. I buy it completely, but it\u2019s an extraordinary statement.</p> <p>By the time the 10th of these rolled around in 1957, CFA Institute Annual Conferences were already a source of insight you couldn\u2019t get anywhere else. As CFA Institute membership grew, these events became an unusually good way to take the temperature of global markets. A retrospective published in 1997 noted\u00a0that \u201cJapanese analysts could be found at every . . . annual conference since 1967.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s still true, but today CFA Institute has members in 159 countries. Not everyone can make the trip. To be frank, I\u2019m not sure where they would all fit if they could. The only stadium I\u2019m aware of that\u2019s large enough to seat them all is located in North Korea.\u00a0It\u2019s worth cultivating a sense of adventure if you\u2019d like to become a durable feature in this profession, but you won\u2019t need to book a flight on Air Koryo\u00a0to follow along this year. I suspect Peter is excited because this means you\u2019re more likely to tune in.</p> <p>Old Friends</p> <p>Jason Voss, CFA, should be well known to regular readers of\u00a0Enterprising Investor. He\u00a0will be co-hosting\u00a0the three-day broadcast from the conference alongside Kelli Palmer.</p> <p>Here is my first recommendation for this weekend: Mark your calendar\u00a0for 1:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on Sunday, 21 May, when the live broadcast\u00a0from Philadelphia begins. After a word from CFA Institute president and CEO Paul Smith, CFA, we\u2019ll jump right into the sharing economy and keep going until Richard Thaler finishes his keynote.</p> <p>My second recommendation is to ask yourself a tough question: What can\u2019t you say?</p> <p>The inspiration for this comes from none other than John Bogle, who will be speaking at the 70th CFA Institute Annual Conference. The\u00a0first\u00a0of Bogle\u2019s\u00a0many bylines\u00a0in the CFA Institute Financial Analysts Journal\u00ae\u00a0was pseudonymous. The article concerned mutual funds, as you might expect, but contains the phrase \u201cmutual funds in general have met the test of time.\u201d</p> <p>Fifteen years later, Bogle would go on to start Vanguard, which is not exactly based on that premise. His discussion of how his thinking changed\u00a0in the intervening period is priceless and underlines the importance of writing your thoughts down. Another lesson to learn is that none of us are perfect. When asked\u00a0why he made such a stunning reversal, he offered a simple answer: \u201cAs the facts changed, of course my opinion changed!\u201d</p> <p>Who bet the farm?</p> <p>Publications ranging from The Economist\u00a0to USA Today\u00a0have noted increasing interest in farmland, which some refer to as \u201cgold with a coupon.\u201d The volatility implied by that characterization has manifested recently in the United States, and farm prices have been falling since 2013.</p> <p>This is a big deal: More than 30% of farmers in Minnesota lost money in 2016. A note last week\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City suggested that trends may intensify. It\u2019s not a local story either. The Financial Times has warned\u00a0of a long-term global oversupply in agricultural markets, but the Savills Global Farmland Index\u00a0is reporting steady growth in farm values. Can both trends persist?</p> <p>Has financial innovation mattered yet?</p> <p>In cryptocurrency land, a growing number of unconfirmed transactions\u00a0and fees in excess of $2 per transaction are drawing attention away from bitcoin and towards Ethereum, a newer cryptocurrency\u00a0that is about a third of the size of bitcoin in terms of total market capitalization.</p> <p>But maybe the better part of wisdom is to zoom out. A recent paper from Thomas Philippon\u00a0asserts that the unit cost of financial intermediation has been a roughly stable 2% per year from 1886 to 2015.

On Thursday Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North Korean government, reportedly warned South Korea against following \u201cpsychopath Trump.\u201d</p> <p>You wonder about these sorts of things. How are investors reacting? In a discussion at the Annual Ben Graham Value Conference IV, hosted by CFA Society New York on Tuesday, investor John Levin observed that in general, \u201cdomestic earnings are undervalued and international earnings are overvalued\u201d as a result of these and other tensions.</p> <p>While wondering about this and flipping through the aforementioned classic papers, I came across Niall Ferguson\u2019s \u201cPolitical risk and the International bond market between the 1848 revolution and the outbreak of the First World War.\u201d Its final section asserts that World War I came as a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d for investors, despite plenty of early discounting.</p> <p>Ferguson\u2019s paper is relevant to the present\u00a0but is easy to misinterpret. Whenever one refers to World War I in a geopolitical discussion, it\u2019s hard to avoid the notion that the war was inevitable. Such predestined wars \u2014\u00a0when established powers clash with rising ones \u2014 are sometimes\u00a0called \u201cThucydides Traps.\u201d However, Arthur Waldron, reviewing\u00a0Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides\u2019s Trap\u00a0by Graham Allison, writes that there is\u00a0little evidence that they really exist.</p> <p>Unexamined assumptions are a silent killer of thoughtful analysis, and one of the most common of these is that \u201cdeveloped\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d markets have important uniform characteristics.

The connection they draw between high productivity and eventual prosperity is worth noting in the context of contemporary worries about productivity growth. The discussion continues, as\u00a0Ryan Avent recently summed up.</p> <p>I thought Stefaan Walgrave and Peter Van Aelst\u2019s article on the contingencies that enable the media to set a political agenda\u00a0to be particularly interesting. The discussion of the methods used to create truth in this arena is fascinating.</p> <p>We often feature posts on the role of women in investment management, so I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t close this section by mentioning Patricia Yancey Martin\u2019s \u201cPractising Gender at Work: Further Thoughts on Reflexivity.\u201d It is an invitation to view gender performance through the same prism that George Soros suggests we view markets: reflexivity.</p> <p>Further Reading</p> <ul> <li>Is it 2057 or 2035 when computers take over the world?

It was easy to adhere to back then: I was managing a portfolio of Pokemon cards.</p> <p>Later, in 2007, my boss at Oppenheimer &amp; Company turned me on to the writings of Jeremy Grantham. After reading how Grantham\u2019s investors abandoned him in 2000 and again in 2007, I promised myself the next time Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo &amp; Co. (GMO) experienced comparable outflows, I would reevaluate my strategy.</p> <p>The outflows bit\u00a0happened earlier this year, but, of course, the mischievous Mr. Grantham complicated my timing signal by suggesting what sounds like a new paradigm. Mean reversion isn\u2019t over, but he says it\u2019ll take longer. Specifically, Grantham says\u00a020 years instead of the seven\u00a0he and his colleagues had been using. That\u2019s a while. As he puts it: \u201clonger than any value manager would like.\u201d</p> <p>He is not alone. Linette Lopez\u00a0and Josh Brown\u00a0have written brilliantly about the persistent sense of ennui in the investment business. It may well be that, as Grantham writes, the comfortable margins of safety experienced in the \u201cBen Graham training period of 1935\u20131965\u2033 could never return.</p> <p>Curious how value investors are coping, I returned to the Manhattan campus of my alma mater, Fordham University, last month for CFA Society New York\u2019s Annual Ben Graham Value Investing Conference IV.</p> <p>The Algorithm Training Period</p> <p>Aswath Damodaran set the ground rules of valuation pretty clearly in his presentation: \u201cYou can\u2019t stop me in valuation,\u201d he said. \u201cI make up my own rules.\u201d</p> <p>Damodaran\u2019s talks always encourage blending\u00a0numbers and narratives\u00a0and his valuation journey\u00a0is important to understand. One critical takeaway is that good valuation is about more than staying out of the DCF Hall of Shame: It is a way to avoid falling victim to unstudied beliefs.</p> <p>This is particularly important for investment professionals of my vintage because the distinction between the Ben Graham training period and today is about more than just price.</p> <p>The legend of Ben Graham emerged in the period 1935 to 1965 and was succeeded by the legend of Warren Buffett.\u00a0Buffett\u00a0has spawned a warren of imitators, but whoever succeeds him may not follow in the same tradition. Jeffrey Tarrant now argues that the next wave of successful investors will be \u201chackers and computer gamers with a healthy disrespect for convention.\u201d There is not necessarily a disjunction between algorithms and the Ben Graham crowd.</p> <p>We\u2019re All Learning</p> <p>Some will still see these new processes as\u00a0departures from the past, but traditions are meant to be examined and challenged. Gartner placed machine learning at the absolute apex of its\u00a02016 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies.</p> <p>The idea of applying algorithms to investment decision making may evoke fears of something like \u201cdeath by GPS\u201d in which automobile drivers become slaves to their navigation systems and lose their critical thinking abilities. But it\u2019s not like the present is perfect, either.</p> <p>Panelist Murray Stahl of Horizon Kinetics invoked M.C. Escher in his characterization of the modern market: \u201cLots of professionals stare at the same information and wonder what other people like them are doing.\u201d Rhetorically, even the unsupervised and easily satirized version of algorithmic investing doesn\u2019t seem that bad compared with Escher\u2019s \u201cimpossible world.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Courtesy of\u00a0xkcd</p> <p>Stahl\u2019s colleague Steven Bregman spoke at the conference last year and discussed\u00a0the specific effects of an \u201cETF Vortex\u201d which he expanded upon at the Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer\u00a0fall conference in 2016.</p> <p>In discussing \u201cThe Apostasy of Jeremy Grantham,\u201d the very same\u00a0Observer\u00a0notes that though some lofty valuations may be warranted in recognition of the technological moats of Amazon and Google, an investor in the S&amp;P 500 is asked to pay a premium earnings multiple for issues those firms are presumed to be in the midst of disrupting.</p> <p>To underline the point: What we have isn\u2019t perfect. However unkempt it may appear, the pile of linear algebra won\u2019t be the least-informed participant in the pricing process.</p> <p>Faith and Critical Reasoning</p> <p>Since the conference was held a few hundred feet away from where I\u2019d finished my undergraduate degree, memories came coursing back. In particular, I found myself dwelling on a required class that granted access to a snippet of the insight stemming from Fordham\u2019s Jesuit traditions: faith and critical reasoning.</p> <p>I\u2019m not much for piety, but at the time, contemplating the limits of reason surprised me. I certainly did not expect to locate my own version of faith, which is easier than it sounds. To do it, remember that faith is what remains after the limit of comprehension. Curiosity will take you to this point easily as anyone who\u2019s ever met a child familiar with the question \u201cwhy?\u201d\u00a0can attest.</p> <p>Value investors are accustomed to asking \u201cWhy?\u201d and hearing nothing back, and commonly profess their faith in the discipline. In the preface to the gold-leafed edition of Security Analysis on my desk, Seth Klarman writes that \u201cbecause there is no certain way to predict what the market will do, one must follow a value investing philosophy at all times.\u201d</p> <p>Klarman\u2019s conclusion to that same preface should give the active manager cause for hope even as we enter the epoch of the algorithm:</p> <p>\u201cThe real secret to investing is that there is no secret to investing. Every important aspect of value investing has been made available to the public many times over beginning in 1934 with the first edition of Security Analysis.\u201d</p> <p>For better or worse, the question of whether this time is different is left to the reader.</p>","tags":["value investing","investment industry"]},{"location":"blog/2017/07/28/funny-computers/","title":"Funny Computers","text":"<p>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Have you tried the new thing at Starbucks? It\u2019s a quick slap across the face for $7.</p> <p>I\u2019m not much of a fan of that chain, but I was looking forward to starting my morning there for a brief moment. I know that The Onion is well known for its contributions to fake news, but something about this particular product launch just feels real. It occupies a space beyond funny: discomfort as a service.</p> <p>In past Weekend Reads columns, we\u2019ve talked about projections for the slow march of artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0and its manifold implications. But I\u2019ve never really zoomed in on one of my favorite areas of research: the quest to make authentically funny jokes.</p> <p>Humor is among the best mysteries in language. It is situational, delicate, and instinctive. As researchers work to create bots that understand and interact with us in detail, humor is also a natural aspiration. Once it\u2019s possible to\u00a0create a bot that is \u201cin on the joke,\u201d\u00a0the thinking goes, a lot of other tasks and objectives become approachable.</p> <p>It\u2019s been slow going. There is an unwritten rule in civil society that you do not attempt to explain jokes. And, of course, generating them algorithmically requires more than just that. A computer will either need a routine to follow or a way to generate one for itself. And that\u2019s before considering how widespread depression is among stand-up comedians. One imagines there is no better way to create an intelligence that hates itself than to bestow upon it the \u201cgift\u201d of humor.</p> <p>Still Trying</p> <p>I have a handful of interesting papers to bring to your attention cataloging a few different approaches. But before you have too much fun, remember that the idea here is to educate as much as entertain. We could talk about automating more mundane things, but thinking about jokes is just way more amusing.</p> <p>A recent paper by Justine T. Kao, Roger Levy, and Noah D. Goodman focuses on ways to predict the incongruity \u2014\u00a0and by extension, the humor \u2014 of words in context. Consider a magician getting so angry that he pulls his hare out. A human understands two incompatible meanings at once and probably chuckles. Without instruction, a computer highlights a grammatical error. This paper not only enumerates an approach to categorizing funny and unfunny sentences, but suggests a means of helping the computer understand why something is funny.</p> <p>Understanding is one thing, but telling a joke is hard work. Can learning approaches with big data create reliable humor? Sasa Petrovic and David Matthews\u00a0of the University of Edinburgh gave it a shot, and focused on jokes of the form \u201cI like my X like I like my Y, Z.\u201d A successful example of this formula: \u201cI like my coffee like I like my war, cold.\u201d One of the approaches they put forward is capable of generating funny jokes about 16% of the time. This compares unfavorably with their sample of human jokes \u2014 33% funny \u2014 but perhaps there is something in the water in Edinburgh. One-in-three hilarity is significantly better than our own limited experience.</p> <p>A 2015 paper with too many authors to name examined something that may be a little closer to home for many readers: The New Yorker Cartoon Contest. The results are perhaps predictable to readers of that magazine: Negative captions were scored to be the funniest. More evidence that there is something bitter about my home city.</p> <p>I am reaching the limit of my ability to discuss this intelligently or amusingly, but can\u2019t help suggesting the curious reader open Liane Gabora, Samantha Thomson, and Kirsty Kitto\u2019s \u201cA Layperson Introduction to the Quantum Approach to Humor.\u201d</p> <p>And Now for Something Completely Different</p> <ul> <li>Brad Setser looks at \u201cChina\u2019s June Reserves\u201d (Council on Foreign Relations)</li> <li>Update to a century of evidence on trend following.

It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Very few successful entrepreneurs dismiss the role luck played in their careers.</p> <p>But can luck be multiplied through language? In the United States, stocks with ticker symbols that begin earlier in the alphabet are 5-15% more liquid than those toward the end.</p> <p>Picking a name for your firm that is both pronounceable and memorable would seem to play some role in the overall success of your effort. After all, you are unlikely to be the only game in town.</p> <p>There are a lot of firms already out there:</p> <ul> <li>Globally, CFA Institute members use more than 58,000 unique names for their employers.</li> <li>The 2017 Investment Company Institute Fact Book\u00a0tallied up 19,215 US-registered investment companies in 2016.</li> <li>The Eurekahedge database contains 23,237 hedge funds globally, 9,789 of which appear to be operating.</li> </ul> <p>Are performance and client alignment enough to stand out? The raw numbers suggest an opportunity to create value through a well-constructed branding strategy.</p> <p>Or you could just use your initials.</p> <p>Simple Formulae</p> <p>An amusing name generator for hedge funds produces remarkably good suggestions despite its unsophisticated proprietary methodology. Judging from the \u201cabout\u201d page, the widget seems to revolve around the question, \u201cHave you ever realized that many hedge fund (and private equity) firms have chosen a name following a common \u2018color\u2019 + \u2018element\u2019 pattern?\u201d</p> <p>That certainly describes BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager in 2017, and likely quite a few more. A glance at the most popular names created by the generator reveals \u201cOakTree Capital\u201d and \u201cBlackStone Partners.\u201d Hopefully those sound familiar to more than a few aspiring entrepreneurs.</p> <p>But I wasn\u2019t kidding about ignoring the problem and just using your initials. The top 100 hedge fund firms as ranked by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha contains entries beginning with MKP, HBK, and GSO, each of which represents one or more initials of the founders. Talk about a personal brand. Pioneering firms from A.W. Jones &amp; Co. to D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. didn\u2019t even bother to summarize.</p> <p>Economist Douglas A. Galbi writes,\u00a0\u201cChoosing a good name involves assessing the social valuation of a name,\u201d which might suggest a certain self-regard among those who put their initials on the enterprise. But given the lean nature of many investment firms, it\u2019s worth mentioning that an eponymous moniker could double as an employee directory, as least at the beginning.</p> <p>Deliberate Strategy</p> <p>Sometimes describing who is at the helm of a fund will tell investors enough about what sort of strategy it is employing. But those times are infrequent. Accordingly, some firms will choose a moniker that sorts them into a desirable box. Putting a strategy like \u201cglobal macro\u201d right into a fund\u2019s title is an easy way to do that.</p> <p>Edward Bishop Smith convincingly argues that \u201cinvestors interpret market information through the lens that identity offers,\u201d and the strategic implications of his work are provocative. Fund firms judged to be \u201catypical\u201d receive proportionally greater flows after a period of good performance, and are less severely punished for periods of negative performance. In his findings, allocators report that \u201ctypical\u201d funds can be more easily replaced mechanically \u2014 in terms of greater competition \u2014 but also emotionally.</p> <p>It costs both money and time to commit to holding an unusual asset, and once you\u2019ve done it, the supposition is that your mind is made up for a while. But a fund manager might wonder if that support will endure in a time of widespread stress. A separate paper by Smith suggests a strategy for reinforcing earned goodwill: name your unusual fund after one of the usual categories.</p> <p>But what if that\u2019s not enough? A well-known branding approach in fund management is to add a dose of gravitas to a\u00a0fund\u2019s name, and a more recent study by Juha Joenv\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4 and Cristian Ioan Tiu shows the addition works, at least for some. Such impressively named funds attract more assets to the firm, but perform worse for their clients.</p> <p>James Saft notes this is a reminder that \u201cLike certain great first-growth wines, more gravitas, or indeed investment skill, is bought than exists.\u201d</p> <p>Perform without Conforming</p> <p>I hope you\u2019re convinced that whatever you call your fund, it\u2019s not the most important variable in its success. Melvin Capital attracted some snark when it launched in 2014, but was a top performer the following year. Presumably, the fund\u2019s performance mattered much more than founder Gabe Plotkin\u2019s decision to name it after his grandfather.</p> <p>If you liked this essay, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["manager selection","language analysis","investment industry"]},{"location":"blog/2017/09/01/summer-of-storms/","title":"Summer of Storms","text":"<p>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Forty-one million people have been affected by flooding and landslides in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, and large swathes of the Houston area are under water\u00a0this week.</p> <p>The rains have reached Karachi, and follow serious flooding in Niger.</p> <p>More than 1,000 are feared dead in Mumbai, and residents are giving thought to buying hovercrafts.

Good luck tuning out the thunder.</p> <p>In the United States, the peals have taken the form of angry protests and attention-grabbing political rhetoric that are hard to ignore. We relitigate old wars and elections while shivering at the cost of future ones. It\u2019s hard to make sense of it all.</p> <p>My suggestion for this weekend \u2014 a long one in the United States \u2014 is to spend some time on slower-moving storms.</p> <p>\u201cZombie\u201d firms constitute roughly 10%\u00a0of the equities listed on US exchanges. Advertising firms are hurting, and perhaps shrinking budgets at their key clients\u00a0have something to do with it. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies have gone from a fad to something that people are investing in through dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Sites like What If Bitcoin\u00a0seem built to inspire further FOMO-driven activity.</p> <p>Our profession may be sheltered from the elements, but it\u2019s not immune. Equity researchers are being asked to work for free. Investors don\u2019t trust their advisers to calculate fees or performance accurately. The investing public may see something in index funds that is not really there. And the context through which large asset managers market their products is\u00a0diluting the value proposition\u00a0of investing.</p> <p>I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not my job to solve these problems, and the suggested first step is for you to take the same solace. The next is to concentrate on an area of economic activity that is so fundamental to our daily lives that we hesitate to think about it.</p> <p>The Attention Economy</p> <p>Digital advertising has long been the default business model of the internet, but subscriptions have been doing something curious recently: growing. The average reader of the allegedly failing New York Times parts with $20 a year while new media sensation Buzzfeed manages to extract just $1\u00a0per reader. It may be time to revisit our assumptions about where the attention economy is heading.</p> <p>The cuts in digital ad budgets are a confounding variable. Aren\u2019t we entering an era when\u00a0advertising and content are indistinguishable? Why is it that as attention grows ever-more saleable, it becomes harder to command as a consequence?</p> <p>There is a good reason my favorite book on content strategy is entitled The Content Trap: This stuff is counterintuitive.</p> <p>A paper on \u201cMeasuring the Effects of Advertising: The Digital Frontier\u201d by Google and Microsoft researchers offers a hint as to why the C-suite is turning a cold shoulder to the ad unit. There is a pervasive endogeneity challenge in advertising: You can never be quite sure if actions have been taken for their own sake or because of promotional activity. Creating the analytics to tie activity to progress is an empirical challenge at best, and statistically impossible in some cases.</p> <p>Predictably, the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) has noticed. They refer to a \u201ctech tax\u201d of more than 40%\u00a0imposed by the structure of the modern ad market that siphons funds away from publishers and promoters alike. But more importantly, that tech tax puts the 8.5% maximum front-end load charged by some mutual funds\u00a0into context. The admissions fee for some areas of economic activity is just too high.</p> <p>And take some time this weekend to consider the disruptor class of companies that has come to dominate the global digital advertising market and the conversation about innovation. It has been hip to wonder about their valuations more than their value proposition. It\u2019s worth revisiting a 1996 essay by Bill Gates\u00a0in which he coined the phrase \u201ccontent is king\u201d while predicting the challenges that the industry would face.</p> <p>His diagnosis of the problem is still provocative:</p> <p>\u201cA major reason paying for content doesn\u2019t work very well yet is that it\u2019s not practical to charge small amounts. The cost and hassle of electronic transactions makes it impractical to charge less than a fairly high subscription rate.</p> <p>\u201cBut within a year the mechanisms will be in place that allow content providers to charge just a cent or a few cents for information. If you decide to visit a page that costs a nickel, you won\u2019t be writing a check or getting a bill in the mail for a nickel. You\u2019ll just click on what you want, knowing you\u2019ll be charged a nickel on an aggregated basis.\u201d</p> <p>We wonder when these long-rumored \u201cmicrotransactions\u201d\u00a0will take hold. Chinese consumers appear willing to pay for content this way, but upset consumers are not hard to come by\u00a0in the United States. There\u2019s even a page dedicated to it on TV Tropes.</p> <p>However these trends develop, now is a good time to retract an article I published almost two years ago entitled \u201cJournalists Should Chill Out about Their Business Model.\u201d Whether because of fake news\u00a0or failures of market structure, chilling out is the wrong prescription for stormy weather like this.</p> <p>Below is some further reading that I hope will brighten your weekend.</p> <ul> <li>A guide to Doomsday prepping for the sane.\u00a0(lcamtuf.coredump.cx)</li> <li>A 175-year grudge match that results in excellent pencils.\u00a0(BBC)</li> <li>Chinese chatbots defect to the United States.

This misses the point. The real driving forces behind security system design usually have nothing to do with such altruistic goals.

Often this is perfectly rational.\u201d</p> <p>The world is somewhat different 16 years later, but not in a way that makes security any easier.

But if not, it\u2019s time to change your passwords. The best approach is to use a unique password for each of your online accounts so that if a hacker gains access to one site, they can\u2019t necessarily move on to others. That sounds quite daunting. Without some help, it means a lot of passwords to memorize.</p> <p>Fortunately, a number of different password managers exist that can help you generate, remember, and categorize your various accounts. The most popular are 1Password, Dashlane, LastPass, and KeePass, and it\u2019s worth spending\u00a0some time figuring one of them out. They make life significantly easier because they will also do other things for you like fill out tedious forms.</p> <p>Once you have set that up,\u00a0take a look at this guide to personal information security. It contains\u00a0many useful tips and is written to be accessible for your friends, colleagues, and perhaps clients. You may also want to develop a\u00a0better understanding of how an attack may unfold or explore whether your firm is equipped to maneuver fast enough. It is past time to be alert, but hopefully thinking these issues through now will help keep you from being alarmed should they actually occur.</p> <p>I\u2019ll leave you with my wishes for a great weekend, and some more upbeat reading.</p> <ul> <li>A visionary deck aimed at \u201cUnlocking Braden\u2019s Potential\u201d (Quonset Point Capital)</li> <li>The cryptocurrency world comes with \u201ca lot of social pressure to eat meat for some reason.\u201d (Inc.)</li> <li>\u201cOpinion: \u2018Let me give you my invaluable insight from spending a whole week in China\u2018\u201d\u00a0\u00a0(China Daily Show)</li> <li>\u201cRedefine Statistical Significance\u201d (Nature)</li> <li>\u201cAutonomous Robots Plant, Tend, and Harvest Entire Crop of Barley\u201d\u00a0(IEEE Spectrum)</li> <li>We\u2019ll get self-driving boats before too long.

Fiduciary oversight and high returns won\u2019t do much for an underfunded system, so it\u2019s easy to see why discussions about reform quickly\u00a0land on a simple question: Where to send the bill?</p> <p>There are\u00a0more productive places to take the conversation.</p> <p>Back in 2010, inspired by a\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0article, an online commenter known as \u201cBeowulf\u201d observed that\u00a0the US Treasury theoretically has the power to mint a trillion-dollar coin.\u00a0Beowulf\u2019s coin idea gained further currency amid the debt ceiling debates of 2011 and 2013. The Obama administration, coin proponents said, could forego negotiations with the US Congress by just minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin and paying off the debt.</p> <p>Platforms as wide-ranging as\u00a0The New York Times, the American Enterprise Institute, and MSNBC discussed the proposal. A former director of the US Mint even\u00a0said that minting the coin was not only legal but (at the time) expedient.</p> <p>My contention is that this \u201csilly but totally legitimate\u201d loophole\u00a0could be used to endow a US sovereign wealth fund.</p> <p>Just in Time</p> <p>The US Government Accountability Office\u00a0released a 173-page survey of our\u00a0fast-approaching retirement crisis\u00a0a few days ago.</p> <p>Things are bad. The growing striation in US incomes contributes to a significant and widening disparity in retirement savings.\u00a0Fidelity suggests\u00a0that savers should seek to have 10-times their income stashed away by age 67.</p> <p>Only the highest quintile of earners has anything near that.</p> <p></p> <p>These private savings are a crucial buffer for retirees. The\u00a0absolute maximum Social Security benefit\u00a0a person retiring in 2018\u00a0can receive is $44,376. But that is still just 43% of the\u00a0lowest base salary the person receiving such benefits would have earned prior to retirement. And most people\u00a0are not so fortunate:\u00a0The average Social Security benefit is closer to $16,000 a year\u00a0and about three of five Social Security recipients rely on the program for at least half of their total income.</p> <p>Moreover, accelerating changes to the US demographic structure will make Social Security\u2019s income-based funding model less and less sustainable. By 2035,\u00a0just 2.2 workers will be supporting each Social Security beneficiary, according to estimates, compared to 2.8 workers today.</p> <p>And those figures assume that\u00a0demographics aside, the nature of work won\u2019t be much different in 2035 than it is today. But as\u00a0Y Combinator president Sam Altman noted, artificial intelligence (AI) is developing\u00a0rapidly\u00a0with potential ramifications for workers. In particular, Altman referenced an OpenAI bot that\u00a0recently defeated some of the top human\u00a0Dota 2 players. Soon after the bot\u2019s victories, a new version was created that exceeded the capabilities of the undefeated one. According to recent estimates,\u00a0AI\u00a0could outmatch humans at translation by 2024, and earlier this month,\u00a0Google unveiled headphones that it claims can translate 40 languages almost in real time.</p> <p>The technological shifts don\u2019t need to be all that significant to significantly impair people\u2019s ability to earn a living.</p> <p>Cash Flows</p> <p>As progress in AI marches onward and reshapes the nature of work, the elderly will continue to depend on a retirement system\u00a0that requires many incomes to function.</p> <p>Even without the forthcoming transformation of the workforce, the funding picture for\u00a0Social Security doesn\u2019t look great.</p> <p></p> <p>What happens if fewer people are working by 2025? What if,\u00a0as PwC estimates,\u00a0\u201cfewer\u201d\u00a0translates\u00a0to the elimination of 38% of US jobs by the 2030s? Peter Norvig, Google\u2019s director of research, \u201ccertainly see[s] that there will be disruptions in employment.\u201d\u00a0Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is not so worried, and I hope he is correct.</p> <p>If he\u2019s not, a cash flow of \u201cjust\u201d negative $174 billion in 2025 will seem fairy-tale optimistic.</p> <p>Learn from the Guardians</p> <p>Other countries have felt these headwinds and done something about them.</p> <p>New Zealand is a case in point, as I learned at\u00a0CFA Society New York\u2018s\u00a03rd Annual\u00a0Sovereign Wealth Fund conference. (These forums are strictly\u00a0Chatham House Rules, but\u00a0I can still tell you what I googled afterward.)</p> <p>The New Zealand Parliament\u00a0recognized the mounting challenges the country\u2019s demographic trends posed\u00a0and in 2001 endowed a sovereign wealth fund to counteract them. The government will begin to withdraw money in 2035\u20132036, but the fund is expected to continue growing until 2073.</p> <p>It has already\u00a0served\u00a0its purpose\u00a0quite well.</p> <p></p> <p>A\u00a0strong internal\u00a0culture of alignment with beneficiaries \u2014 employees refer to themselves as\u00a0\u201cguardians\u201d \u2014 has propelled this growth. So too has a\u00a0remarkable governance structure\u00a0and\u00a0the innate advantages that sovereign wealth funds enjoy. These\u00a0kinds of investing entities\u00a0can be remarkably pro-social. They don\u2019t just provide\u00a0a direct\u00a0link between market progress and social welfare, they also build, buy, and operate infrastructure; stabilize currencies; and prove up new asset classes.</p> <p>Imagine how much economic anxiety in the United States could be soothed by such a mechanism.</p> <p>Matthew O\u2019Brien wrote in 2013, at the height of the debt ceiling debate, that the trillion-dollar coin \u201cmight just be the crazy solution Washington deserves and needs.\u201d Today, if properly governed and given time to mature \u2014 a 30-year plus horizon would be ideal \u2014 a sovereign wealth fund bankrolled by that trillion-dollar coin might just be crazy enough to\u00a0cushion the approaching impact of\u00a0the US retirement crisis.</p> <p>At the very least, it would give Americans a tangible reason to worry less about how they will afford to eat in their old age.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["income inequality","sovereign wealth funds","fiscal health","retirement crisis","pension funds"]},{"location":"blog/2017/11/10/study-the-exceptions/","title":"Study the Exceptions","text":"<p>Warning: This essay features a discussion of French literary theory.</p> <p>I know, bear with me. The good news: It\u2019s pretty funny. And if you\u2019re looking for a new and productive window on some of the unexpected developments in 2017, each of the linked stories will give you a view of something interesting and amusing.</p> <p>\u2018Pataphysics \u2014 spelled with an apostrophe to avoid the obvious pun \u2014 is hard to define. That\u2019s the point. It\u2019s been described as the science of imaginary solutions, of the particular, and of the laws governing exceptions.</p> <p>It was put forward by Alfred Jarry, who suggested it established the \u201csuperiority of virtuality\u201d over the concrete. Not accepting conventional wisdom at face value is right in the center of the \u2018pataphysical tradition. Dr. Faustroll, one of Jarry\u2019s characters, explains:</p> <p>\u201cContemporary science is founded upon the principle of induction: most people have seen a certain phenomenon precede or follow some other phenomenon most often, and conclude therefrom that it will ever be thus. Apart from other considerations, this is true only in the majority of cases, depends on the point of view, and is codified only for convenience \u2014 if that!\u201d</p> <p>The \u2018pataphysical prescription is to appreciate\u00a0the subtle, irreproducible, and obscure.\u00a0Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\u2019s Archive of Useless Research is an interesting example of the value that can come from such an exercise.</p> <p>In a 1989 interview with UPI, the archivist Helen Samuels explained that the university keeps it because \u201cWe\u2019re an institution that looks at the evolution of scientific research . . . It\u2019s very easy to document our Nobel Prize winners and advances in mainstream science, but it\u2019s also useful to document the craziness, the fringe, or you don\u2019t get a full picture of what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s not enough to go off the beaten path. To a \u2018pataphysician, it\u2019s also critical to think about the nature of paths themselves.</p> <p>This is because the delivery of information changes both its nature and our relationship to it. In his essay \u201c\u2018Pataphysics of Year 2000,\u201d Jean Baudrillard writes, \u201cWhere should one stop the perfecting of the stereo? Its bounds or limits are constantly pushed back or forced to retreat in the face of technical obsessions. Where should information stop?\u201d</p> <p>When I talk to investment professionals, perhaps the most common observation they offer is that there is too much disconnected information. The real-time trap \u2014 where we are bombarded with updates yet learn nothing \u2014 should be familiar to all of us. Baudrillard described it and the resulting alienation of societies from their own history at the dawn of the millennium.</p> <p>But what does this mean for our work?</p> <p>Investment managers are intimately concerned with seeing the truth of the organizations that they invest in and how they relate to society. As Damian P. O\u2019Doherty of the University of Manchester\u00a0wrote nearly a decade ago:</p> <p>We are beginning to see then that, on the one hand, we are confronted with practitioners of Theory, inheriting the traditions of sober, scientific method, but producing, nonetheless, strange and often startling, internally inconsistent findings; on the other, all pretence at participating in a disciplinary project that proceeds by linear, incremental steps of iteration and addition has been abandoned.</p> <p>Seemingly unconcerned with collective synthesis or contributing to any shared, iterative construction of a common understanding of organization that would enable communication, debate and compromise, recent developments simply prefer to promote idiosyncrasy, difference and shock.\u201d</p> <p>He concludes by asserting that \u2018pataphysics offers a solution to this issue\u00a0by prompting us to see the absurdities that surround us for exactly what they are: exceptional.</p> <p>The spreadsheets and databases we employ as investment professionals often purport to describe \u201cthe universe\u201d without irony. There are good reasons for this, but as we go into the weekend and towards the end of the year, we\u2019d be well served by remembering that these universes are\u00a0systems of exceptions.</p> <p>Here are a few related readings you might find interesting:</p> <ul> <li>\u201c\u2018Pataphysics and Computing\u201d (Andrew Hugill, Bath Spa University)</li> <li>\u201c\u2018Pataphysics: Your Favorite Cult Artist\u2019s Favorite Pseudoscience\u201d (Pitchfork)</li> <li>A measurement study of the politically incorrect \u201cdark underbelly\u201d of the Internet.\u00a0(Proceedings of the Eleventh International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media)</li> <li>Surreal Memes (Reddit)</li> <li>\u201cIt Wasn\u2019t Worth It, Says 103-Year-Old Vegetarian\u201d (The Daily Mash)</li> </ul> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["eclectica","attention economy"]},{"location":"blog/2017/11/15/looking-forward-after-years-at-the-vanguard/","title":"Looking Forward After Years at the Vanguard","text":"<p>This interview was first published on the CFA Institute website.</p> <p>John C.

The company\u2019s $4.1 billion in operating income during 2016 is a drop in the S&amp;P 500\u2019s trillion, according to Edward Yardeni and Debbie Johnson in their report, \u201cStock Market Briefing: NIPA vs. S&amp;P 500 Profit.\u201d (See\u00a0Figure 16).</p> <p>Monopoly Money</p> <p>The 10 most profitable firms in the Fortune 500 made $226 billion in 2015, and Amazon still isn\u2019t one of them.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth wondering why. When McKinsey &amp; Company released an analysis of the global profit pool in 2015, they highlighted a trend that would seem to play directly in Amazon\u2019s favor:</p> <p>\u201cSectors such as finance, information technology, media, and pharmaceuticals \u2014 which have the highest margins \u2014 are developing a winner-take-all dynamic, with a wide gap between the most profitable companies and everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>That same report included a remarkable finding: The top 10% of firms account for 80% of all profits. This leaves us with two seemingly conflicting truths: Winners win bigger than ever, but one of the world\u2019s biggest winners is not making much in the way of profits.</p> <p>How\u2019s that for a brain twister?</p> <p>Making sense of the company\u2019s soaring stock price and still-forthcoming\u00a0profits\u00a0is becoming a cottage industry. Aswath Damodaran writes\u00a0in \u201cLoss Leader or Value Creator? Deconstructing Amazon Prime\u201c:</p> <p>\u201cI have long described Amazon as a Field of Dreams company, one that goes for higher revenues first and then thinks about ways of converting those revenues into profits; if you build it, they will come. In coining this description, I am not being derisive but arguing that the market\u2019s willingness to be patient with the company is largely a result of the consistency with [which] Jeff Bezos has told the same story for the company, since 1997, and acted in accordance with it.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon is an example of a long time frame functioning as a latent currency for investors. It\u2019s the \u201cdark matter\u201d that helps rapid growth and unrelated profits make sense. The central presence of the company\u2019s founder helps us to have faith that a vision \u2014 not just millions of packages \u2014 will be delivered.</p> <p>But now imagine Amazon is just a singularly successful operator in an entirely new market context. Remember: If the \u201cworld is flat,\u201d it\u2019s flat for everyone. Amazon may just be the focus because we pay extra attention to companies that come early in the alphabet.</p> <p>Joseph Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize in economics for advancing models that accounted for asymmetries in information. In \u201cAmerica Has a Monopoly Problem\u00a0\u2014 and It\u2019s Huge,\u201d he\u00a0recommends considering a breadth of issues that can come from increasing concentration in market power.</p> <p>No Easy\u00a0Answers</p> <p>It might be that the lens of competition and antitrust simply provides a window into a set of challenges that are best addressed elsewhere. Carl Shapiro traces the problem elegantly in a forthcoming paper for the International Journal of Industrial Organization.\u00a0His discussion with\u00a0Walter Frick\u00a0of\u00a0the Harvard Business Review\u00a0ends with the opinion: \u201cwhen people express general concerns about the power of the large tech firms and look to regulation to check that power, I\u2019m more skeptical.\u201d</p> <p>There seems to be a consensus that the analytical norms of antitrust regulation that focus mostly on short-term price effects should be revisited, but there is no evidence that such work\u00a0can invert the anticompetitive nature of\u00a0these newer firms.</p> <p>Damodaran revisited his thoughts on Amazon\u00a0and other large tech companies in a lecture at the\u00a0CFA Institute Conference: Equity Research and Valuation 2017. When the subject of monopoly came up, he said, \u201cThese models have an in-built structure where they are going to tip into winner-take-all areas. The cost of adding a new user gets smaller and smaller the bigger you get. [This starts] creating a competitive advantage that gets harder and harder to bridge.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not unusual for a few stocks to drive broader market performance in a given year, but we would be foolish to ignore that it has been the same several stocks quite frequently in recent years. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google are responsible\u00a0for roughly 20%\u00a0of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance this year, and generated more than the entire return\u00a0of the index in 2015. Is it healthy\u00a0that including or excluding monopoly firms explains so much performance?</p> <p>It\u2019s true regardless.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter**. **</p> <p>\ufeffThis was first published by CFA Institute.</p>","tags":["active vs. passive investing","antitrust","technology"]},{"location":"blog/2017/12/06/pioneering-in-wall-street-how-women-came-and-stayed-and-conquered-1927/","title":"Pioneering in Wall Street: How Women Came and Stayed and Conquered (1927)","text":"<p>I spotted a remarkable artifact this weekend while vintage shopping: a 1927 copy of Century magazine with an essay by Eugenia Wallace entitled Pioneering in Wall Street:\u00a0How Women Came and Stayed and Conquered.</p> <p>Her legacy is essentially un-googleable, but the perspective Wallace shares is stunning for both its optimism and the candor with which she recounts the entry of women into the investment business.

The most straightforward definition I can find is this: if a currency's nominal exchange rate depreciates by 10% or more in one year and then 25% or more in the following year, it's a currency crisis.\u00a0</p> <p>This definition originated (as far as I can tell) from a 1996 paper by Jeffrey Frankel and Andrew Rose, and has also been used in NBER materials. The numbers appear to have been picked somewhat out of thin air, but it's a useful rule of thumb.</p> <p>The recent run up in cryptocurrency prices has led me to wonder how many people have had their lives shaped by these sorts of events. If I'd lived through one, I think I'd be more likely to see the volatility, opacity, and other risks associated with crypto-assets as acceptable. They might even seem typical of currency in general.</p> <p>The links above list a number of crises, but are only updated through 2007. I pulled Nominal Effective Exchange Rate\u00a0(NEER)\u00a0data for 112 countries from the World Bank's Global Economic Monitor\u00a0to do a quick-and-dirty update. Only 85 countries had data available in 1988, but by 1995 all 112 were included.\u00a0</p> <p>Here's the number of countries in crisis each year.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>Here's the spreadsheet with the data.\u00a0</p> <p>Using this sort of rule is imperfect, since depreciations need to align with the 12 month calendar in order to register. For instance, Indonesia's 69% depreciation in 1998 doesn't count because it happened fast.\u00a0</p> <p>But with that said, roughly 1.3 billion people live in countries that have experienced this sort of currency crisis in my lifetime, many of them more than once. Here's a table of all of the countries that have.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>It would be difficult to establish a hard link between these events and openness to crypto-assets, because they have occurred much less frequently in recent years. That comes across in the first chart, but here is the YoY change in all of the currencies in the dataset. It's amazing how much things have calmed down.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>The contemporary picture is only placid compared to the chaos that surrounded the fall of the Berlin Wall, though. Since 2010, the percentage of countries in the sample that have experienced 10% or greater YoY depreciation has been rising steadily.</p> <p></p> <p>There isn't a clear link between this currency volatility and demand for crypto, but I think it's helpful to understand the dispersion of human experiences with currency. Most of the world's capital is concentrated in countries that have been insulated from these sorts of wild price swings, and perhaps as a result investors forget how frequent they are.\u00a0</p> <p>Most of the bullish outlooks I've seen for crypto-assets are predicated on eventually capturing a material proportion of global market share. That seems moderately more plausible (though in no way preordained) after this exploration. And certainly it's easier to see why there might be innate global demand for a new kind of money.</p>","tags":["economic geography","crypto","macro"]},{"location":"blog/2018/01/18/how-to-see-the-hidden-risks-of-etfs/","title":"How to See the Hidden Risks of ETFs","text":"<p>I wrote this with my CFA Institute colleagues Paul Kovarsky, CFA, and Antonella Puca, CFA, CIPM, CPA. It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted more flows than \u201cany structure ever\u201d in 2017, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Eric Balchunas.</p> <p>Is that bad? Steven Bregman, CFA, of Horizon Kinetics says the herd behavior ETFs inspire will be the \u201cDelivery Agent of the Great Bubble.\u201d Mohamed El-Erian believes that the instruments \u201cover-promote\u201d the liquidity of their underlying securities, which is in line with findings from BlackRock in 2015 that fixed-income ETFs trade much more often than the bonds that comprise them.</p> <p>Such sins, both real and imagined, mean ETFs are now described as \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d with disconcerting regularity. Mark Weidman, the global head of iShares, has said \u201cETF apocalypse concerns are way overdone\u201d at least once. And yet the murmurs continue.</p> <p>There is no doubt ETFs are weird, but managing the risks they pose on behalf of clients doesn\u2019t require a high-definition vision of the future. It just takes a simple question:</p> <p>What can\u2019t the client see?</p> <p>ETFs are a great way to fulfill client objectives, but they also create\u00a0a handful of opportunities to miss the mark. So advisers need to be vigilant.</p> <p>A primary risk is that the fund will fail to appropriately track its benchmark. This can happen because of market conditions, despite the best intentions of the fund sponsors. So rather than adopting a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d mindset, advisers need to be diligent and monitor the ETFs in which they invest.</p> <p>A straightforward example of this comes from the world of high-yield ETFs.\u00a0Lisa Abramowicz noted this summer that the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, trading under the ticker JNK, underperformed its benchmark by an average of 1.69% for the three years preceding her 18 August 2017 column. Rival fund BlackRock\u2019s iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG)\u2019s three-year average underperformance of 0.79% seems like alpha by comparison.</p> <p>It\u2019s understandable that there would be a difference between the performance of an index and the vehicles designed to track it. Even when their objective is just to replicate an index, investment vehicles come with costs that are not always explicit. A 2013 exploration of these issues from Morningstar found that funds generally did a good job limiting tracking error, but also pointed to interesting issues. The weekly error for ETFs tracking the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, for instance, ranged from 0.04% to 1.5%.</p> <p>A Defining Challenge</p> <p>If the performance of ETFs that track specific indices can be that variable, what about the funds with more idiosyncratic objectives?</p> <p>Take the iShares MSCI BRIC ETF (BKF) and the Guggenheim BRIC ETF (EEB) as cases in point. Both seek to provide diversified exposure to Brazil, Russia, India, and China, but how much of each? The iShares offering had 61.5% invested in China and 7% in Russia at the time of this writing, while Guggenheim\u2019s fund had 20.2% in China, 13.9% in Hong Kong, and 18.1% in Russia.</p> <p>You would think targeting just four countries would make the innate challenge of defining emerging markets simpler, but that\u2019s just not the case. Fund structures can only mask the intrinsic complexity of markets, not eliminate it.</p> <p>A vignette about ExxonMobil that Bregman offered to Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer illustrates this well:</p> <p>\u201cAside from being 25% of the iShares U.S. Energy ETF, 22% of the Vanguard Energy ETF, and so forth, Exxon is simultaneously a Dividend Growth stock and a Deep Value stock. It is in the USA Quality Factor ETF and in the Weak Dollar U.S. Equity ETF. Get this: It\u2019s both a Momentum Tilt stock and a Low Volatility stock. It sounds like a vaudeville act.\u201d</p> <p>It may be the case that 138 years after John D. Rockefeller et al. formed the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, the shares of its corporate successor are indeed a tidy fit for such a broad diversity of investment objectives. But if that\u2019s true, it also means that the risk of confusing activity and progress in managing ETF portfolios is real.</p> <p>Ask the Right Questions</p> <p>Determined curiosity is the primary asset you have to address these risks. A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) is likely to be helpful, but there is no substitute for your own analysis.</p> <p>So ask questions. How liquid is this fund compared to the securities that compose it? Does it trade at a premium or a discount to its net asset value? Is there leverage built into the structure, and if so, is that leverage constant or variable? How closely does it track its benchmark?</p> <p>But don\u2019t forget the most important question: Does this asset fulfill a useful purpose in this portfolio? The recent wave of ETF offerings comes with a substantial risk of distraction: Diligencing structures are not necessarily indicative of progress towards fulfilling an investment objective.</p> <p>It is critical to advance the state of practice in this area, and that\u2019s why we will be joining industry leaders at the Inside ETFs Conference\u00a0next week to listen, learn, and teach. What\u2019s clear already is that most practitioners have plenty to learn about the structures that will likely continue to grow in prominence for the rest of our careers.</p> <p>As cutting edge becomes commonplace, we\u2019re hopeful that discussion will turn away from apocalyptic predictions and towards the mechanics of diligence.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["wealth management","etfs"]},{"location":"blog/2018/01/22/seven-reasons-india-is-primed-for-growth/","title":"Seven Reasons India is Primed for Growth","text":"<p>I wrote this for CFA Institute with the peripatetic and wonderful Sameer Somal, CFA. It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>To many investors, India seems incredible but not necessarily investable.</p> <p>Indeed, the challenges of adapting to India\u00a0as an investor go beyond not knowing what you don\u2019t know: You won\u2019t even be able to say most of it. Hindi and English are the most widely used languages, but the country has 22 official languages and many more are spoken, taught in schools, and printed in newspapers.</p> <p>So there is little chance you\u2019ll be mistaken for a local, but neither would either of us.</p> <p>Sloane Ortel first visited India in 2009 and returned earlier this year for a three-month stint working out of the CFA Institute office in Mumbai. Sameer S. Somal, CFA, spends about a third of the year there. Though he is \u201cIndian-American,\u201d in India they just call him \u201cAmerican.\u201d</p> <p>Here are seven reasons why we\u2019re planning to keep going back.</p> <p>1. Real returns are available.</p> <p>Investors once assumed their rupees would depreciate at a nearly constant rate. Why? Because of experience: From 2006 to 2013, inflation averaged over 9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p> <p>A lot has changed. In the summer of 2017, the Indian CPI was rising more slowly than\u00a0the United Kingdom\u2019s.</p> <p>So investors might benefit by resetting their return expectations to the Indian context. A recent set of capital market assumptions from BlackRock forecasts nominal returns below 4% for every fixed-income asset class.</p> <p>Indian citizens have a realistic prospect of earning 5% after inflation with a simple and widely available fixed deposit.</p> <p>And Indians remain criminally under-allocated in their domestic stock market, as this spreadsheet demonstrates. Just 0.17% of all wealth held by urban households is invested in equities, compared to 4.35% in fixed deposits. Land and gold are the most widely held assets, and though investors have shifted from physical to financial assets, the rate of change has room to accelerate, especially if India\u2019s becomes the world\u2019s best-performing stock market.</p> <p>2. A demographic dividend is due.</p> <p>India\u2019s youth is one of its most promising economic features: Census data indicates that about 41% of its population is under 20.</p> <p>By 2026, India is projected to have the world\u2019s largest working-age population, and by 2030, 28% of the global workforce will live in India. India\u2019s labor force will stay young for many decades to come. That\u2019s an epic opportunity to create the next generation of global leaders.</p> <p>But every dividend is also a liability. India\u2019s youth want work and meaningful careers. There just aren\u2019t enough jobs. The OECD found more than 30% of the country\u2019s young people are out of work and only about 5% of India\u2019s labor force has any formal training.</p> <p>The government hopes to address this deficit through\u00a0the Skill India\u00a0and the Make in India initiatives, among other projects.\u00a0While there are not enough jobs in India,\u00a0the demographics of many developed market economies are aging. The global appetite for Indian human capital in the form of skilled actuaries, programmers, researchers, doctors and engineers from India continues to expand.</p> <p>3. The middle class is booming.</p> <p>India\u2019s \u201cUrban Mass\u201d cohort, composed of 129 million people earning over $3,200 on average, will drive the country\u2019s growth, according to a\u00a0Goldman Sachs report.</p> <p>There is more room to expand: Median household income in China was around the same level in 2016. But an equivalent income in\u00a0India buys quite\u00a0a bit more than it does in China. Rural wages have also grown rapidly over the last decade.</p> <p>Banks want access to this growing consumer population, and there are plenty of opportunities. Morgan Stanley estimates that India\u2019s 9% mortgage-to-GDP ratio in 2016 could rise to about 17% by 2026. Broader capital access comes with side effects: India\u2019s property sales are expected to compound at 14% a year from 2016 to 2020 and at 18% from 2020 to 2025.</p> <p>This growth is not easy to leverage without significant adaptation, as Ortel observed earlier this year:</p> <p>\u201cA who\u2019s who of firms have tried and failed to expand here: Fidelity, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Nomura. The list of exits grows. The better part of wisdom as a new entrant to the market is not to discount these efforts.\u201d</p> <p>But those who surmount the challenges of doing business here will earn the rewards. If India\u2019s aggregate consumer spending reaches $13 trillion by 2030 as forecast, the country will be the world\u2019s largest consumer market. The recent launch of Renault\u2019s $4,000 Kwid is a case study in how global firms can adapt their products to local tastes.</p> <p>4. A digital revolution is brewing.</p> <p>India is now the world\u2019s second largest internet market, with a smartphone user base of over 300 million people. The digital revolution is expected to double the country\u2019s internet users by 2021, when an estimated 829 million Indians \u2014 or\u00a059% of the total population\u00a0\u2014 will be online, up from 373 million, or 28% of the population, in 2016.</p> <p>A massive national fiber-optic network is being built to power this growth. Much of that network will be constructed in villages and public spaces, with\u00a0free WiFi coming to 1,050 villages\u00a0as well as many railway stations.\u00a0This will continue to cross-pollinate other verticals, including eCommerce. Flipkart, India\u2019s domestic competition for Amazon, already employs 30,000 people.</p> <p>There are already more broadband users in India than there are people in the United States.\u00a0India also has more Facebook users than any other country, having surpassed the United States this year. Mobile video IP traffic will accelerate from 57% of usage in 2016 to 76% in 2021, when India will be consuming 84 billion internet video minutes per month.</p> <p>The digital revolution will improve the delivery of government services. There is a thoughtful argument that criminal and political systems are vertically integrated in India, and so leveraging technology to eliminate intermediaries is about more than just efficiency. The ease of doing business index is already jumping as a result.</p> <p>5. The India Stack is growing.</p> <p>The India Stack is\u00a0as exciting as it is terrifying. What is it? A national biometric identity database with 1.2 billion entries that link to medical records, bank accounts, government services, and more. It is an open invitation for app developers to build on a subcontinental scale.</p> <p>It begins with Aadhaar, which means \u201cfoundation\u201d in English. This is the national biometric database that started in 2008 and now covers around 82% of Indians.</p> <p>The system is far from perfect: The Hindu god Hanuman received an Aadhaar card in 2014,\u00a0so there are concerns about data quality as well as\u00a0security and privacy issues. There have already been significant leaks, and Jayanth Varma compares its transaction authorization to \u201csigning a blank piece of paper.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s a reason Wharton\u2019s fintech group calls it \u201cthe bedrock of a digital India.\u201d</p> <p>A significant plank of the India Stack, the Unified Payments Interface, will allow Indians to move money freely without negotiating various \u201cwalled garden\u201d e-wallet networks.\u00a0More\u00a0and more\u00a0people are opting in.</p> <p>In a country with hundreds of spoken languages and widely varying educational levels, something along the lines of India Stack is the only way for digital payments to take hold.</p> <p>6. India\u2019s fintech opportunity is here.</p> <p>Fintech partnerships in India are an area of extraordinary potential.</p> <p>According to PwC and Startupbootcamp, 95% of incumbent financial services firms in India are interested in fintech partnerships.</p> <p>Payments stand out as a hotbed of activity and innovation. The Unified Payments Interface is a case in point: Its monthly transactions rose to almost 77 million in October. It\u2019s not a coincidence that PayTm, a payments company, recently attracted the largest funding round by a single investor in an Indian start-up.</p> <p>Peer-to-peer lending (P2P) is also a hot area. The Reserve Bank of India has just announced regulations for the sector to help move it out of the\u00a0shadows and into the mainstream. But the next wave of financial services innovation is coming from unexpected places. Apps that provide telematics are helping to understand driving behavior and underwrite risk in motor insurance, and e-commerce marketplaces like Flipkart are launching financial services offerings.</p> <p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. According to a report by Tracxn, there were 750 registered fintech companies in India in 2015, of which 174 launched that year alone. The opportunities for growth are vast: Even after demonetization, 95% of financial transactions in India involve cash. Fintech can provide India\u2019s high-earning youth with investor education and direct access to the tools to help them make the most informed decisions. And as access to broadband and smartphones increases, these firms could offer inclusive financial services to the whole country.</p> <p>7. Institutions are strengthening.</p> <p>There are many forms of infrastructure. The traditional kind \u2014 bridges, roads, and ports \u2014 is still much needed in India. But the intellectual and relational infrastructure necessary for development is growing ever more robust. A few years ago, Ortel spoke with author Anita Raghavan about the breadth of the Indian diaspora, which is the world\u2019s largest.</p> <p>Those are familial and geopolitical ties, but India is making remarkable strides on other fronts. Last year, U.K. Sinha, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, said that minority shareholders have better rights\u00a0in India than they do in the United States. While saying it doesn\u2019t make it so, India\u2019s soft infrastructure has made great strides.</p> <p>A whopping 70% of the Indian population pays out of their own pocket for medical expenses. This typically strengthens the financial mechanism of the insurance sector. In the United States, the out-of-pocket expenditure is much lower, around 10% to 12%.</p> <p>Hard infrastructure has made\u00a0advances as well. India\u2019s rail network moves 23 million people every day, and will soon feature\u00a0solar-powered coaches. This is progress, but more rails and roads will be needed to close India\u2019s output gap.</p> <p>Growth comes next.</p> <p>The domestic investment industry is a hub for business process outsourcing, but banks are shipping highly skilled work to India to support a variety of global businesses. For example, Goldman Sachs spent $30 million to establish a center in Bangalore back in 2004. Now it is building a $200-million campus there with enough space to accommodate 9,000 people, more than a quarter of its 34,000 global staff.</p> <p>But India is still a tiny position in the global market portfolio. At 8.64% of the MSCI emerging markets index, India is weighted less than Taiwan (11.42%) and South Korea (15.63%). Increased attention should change that.</p> <p>All we can say for sure is that we\u2019ll keep going back. The next decade of growth in India will bring millions out of poverty, into the formal economy, and toward better lives. It will be remarkable to watch and rewarding to participate in.</p> <p>Perhaps we\u2019ll see you over there?</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["india"]},{"location":"blog/2018/02/15/joshua-gotbaum/","title":"Joshua Gotbaum","text":"<p>The Hon.

It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>Say whatever you want about the world, but there\u2019s never been a better time to be an end investor.</p> <p>Many things investment professionals fear \u2014 fee compression, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain \u2014 benefit clients through higher account balances and lower fees.</p> <p>Asset owners are the largest of those clients. Though they are frequently lumped together as \u201cinstitutional investors,\u201d they can be as different from each other as any two individuals. The only characteristic they reliably share is size, which means their goals shape the market.</p> <p>But what exactly are those goals? What do these organizations want?</p> <p>Thomas Brigandi and his team of more than 400 volunteers began organizing the Asset Owner Series at CFA Society New York in 2015 with these questions at heart. Since then, they have hosted discussions among senior investors representing over $38 trillion in assets under management (AUM) or advisory (AUA). These candid, off-the-record conversations are open only to investment professionals. They will be increasingly available to CFA Institute members\u00a0globally\u00a0at little to no cost, but only in person.</p> <p>Institutional investors are characterized as \u201cbig fish\u201d and \u201csmart money,\u201d but what else are they? Though Asset Owner Series commentary is not for attribution, the perspectives offered in these forums have removed some of the mystery surrounding these institutions, particularly the seven major types of asset owners and the motivations that are driving them.</p> <p>Here are these \u201cbig fish\u201d in roughly descending order of their AUM:</p> <p>1. Pensions</p> <p>Pension funds are the largest asset owners, with $36.4 trillion in AUM in 2016, according to Willis Towers Watson\u2019s \u201c2017 Global Pension Asset Study.\u201d They fall into four primary categories:   - \"ESG Research\"   - \"Sustainable Business\" - \"ESG Research\" - Corporate pensions\u00a0are sponsored by a single employer or several related employers within a corporate group. Many are \u201cdefined-contribution\u201d (DC) plans, which means the plan sponsor does not bear the investment risk. The largest corporate pension plans include those of IBM, AT&amp;T, and United Technologies. Edmund A. Mennis, CFA, and Chester D. Clark\u2019s\u00a0Understanding Corporate Pension Plans\u00a0offers a thorough overview. - Public pensions\u00a0traditionally provide public employees in the United States and Canada with defined benefits after they retire. These benefits are based on a formula, not the investment returns of the beneficiary\u2019s contributions. Mark Harrison, CFA, provided a helpful primer on the closely watched and widely emulated Canadian public pension fund model. - Union pensions, called Taft-Hartley plans in the United States, are operated by groups of companies together with officials of the unions that represent their workers. They are common in the building trades, trucking, retail,\u00a0and mining industries. Some of the largest and most influential are the 1199SEIU Pension and Retirement Funds, Broadway League, National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT), and National Electrical Benefit Fund.</p> <p>Pensions tend to be conservative and often rely on\u00a0liability-driven investment strategies to ensure that funds will be available to pay benefits when they are due. Some have raised concerns that these funds will not be able to fulfill their responsibilities.</p> <p>2. Insurance Company General Accounts</p> <p>Insurance companies tend to invest the premiums they are paid in order to boost their earnings. Globally, insurance company assets totaled about $23 trillion in 2015, according to the most recent insurance indicators asset data from the OECD.</p> <p>The liabilities assumed by insurers can vary considerably in their predictability and timeframe, which leads to significant divergence in how the portfolios created to offset them are managed. Differences in regulation, product mix, and competition will play a role in the ultimate composition of these portfolios, but we can lay out some high level differences.</p> <p>The three primary types of general accounts are:</p> <ul> <li>Health: Providing health insurance creates a predictable but short-term liability with high liquidity needs. Managers of these accounts will thus keep as much as 25% of their portfolio in cash to meet these demands, and will tend to have some equity exposure to allow for long-term growth.\u00a0Aetna Capital Management and CIGNA Investment Management are some of the largest organizations of this kind.</li> <li>Life: These long-term liabilities are often offset through long-term fixed income instruments, like Treasuries and corporate bonds. Managers tend to be prohibited from holding large equity allocations, so will diversify into mortgages and other assets while holding proportionally small cash balances. New York Life Insurance and MetLife are examples of large life insurance general accounts.</li> <li>Property and casualty: These insurers face \u201clumpy\u201d liability streams that they offset by keeping as much as 10% of their assets in cash and 70% in bonds. They will typically\u00a0blend equities and other assets in the balance of the portfolio to provide for some long-term growth. Among the large property and casualty insurance general accounts are Chubb and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.</li> </ul> <p>Warren Buffett is perhaps the most widely known investor on the planet\u00a0and has built his impressive track record in part by shrewdly managing the portfolios of insurance companies. John L. Maginn, CFA,\u00a0explored how these entities operated in the mid-1990s\u00a0in the United States.</p> <p>3. Sovereign Wealth Funds</p> <p>Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are state-owned investment funds whose investable asset base is derived from a country\u2019s reserves and has been set aside for intergenerational savings, reserve management, fiscal stabilization, retirement benefits, or development. Taken together, they manage just over $7.5 trillion in assets.</p> <p>Most SWF funding comes from budget and trade surpluses or revenue generated from the exports of natural resources. They are generally not liability-driven investors, and as such, can adopt a long time horizon in their investment activities. Some funds have pursued innovative strategies to exploit the \u201chuge advantage\u201d their unique nature affords them, while others have fallen prey to political pressures and underperformed.</p> <p>The roughly $900-billion China Investment Corporation is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds, and also provides an interesting case study on the mechanics of operating such a fund. The fund\u2019s chief representative, Felix P. Chee, discussed\u00a0how the fund approaches portfolio construction and risk management in 2011.</p> <p>A more detailed case study can be found in Multi Asset Strategies: The Future of Investment Management, edited by my colleague. Larry Cao, CFA. The sixth chapter details the evolution of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. The closely watched fund does not reveal its AUM, but the US State Department estimated they\u00a0were in excess of $300 billion in 2017.</p> <p>4. Investment Consultant Outsourced CIOs</p> <p>The majority of large investment consultants have outsourced CIO practices. Pensions &amp; Investments\u2018 database shows total OCIO assets reached $1.69 trillion as of 31 March 2017.</p> <p>An OCIO will often manage all or a portion of the asset owner\u2019s investment portfolio with discretion to make and monitor changes. The OCIO divisions of investment consultants differ from the core investment consulting business, which is to provide asset allocation and asset manager selection advice to asset owners. Collectively, investment consultants advise on trillions of dollars in asset owner assets under a nondiscretionary, advisory-only framework.\u00a0Mercer, Russell Investments, and Aon Hewitt Investment Consultants are among the largest of these organizations.</p> <p>Hiring one of these firms can \u201cpresent significant advantages for a small fund,\u201d as they bring significant expertise in investment management and manager selection, according to Jeffrey V. Bailey, CFA, and Thomas M. Richards, CFA, in their primer for investment trustees.\u00a0Though they also warn that the model comes with drawbacks, most notably that \u201cthe natural checks and balances of standard solutions\u201d are somewhat lacking.</p> <p>5. Single Family Offices</p> <p>A single family office (SFO) is a private company that manages investments and trusts for one family. The number of family offices in the United States has grown to more than 3,000 with total AUM between $1 trillion and $1.2 trillion, according to Capgemini\u2019s \u201cGlobal State of Family Offices Report.\u201d These organizations can cost more than $1 million a year to operate\u00a0and thus are mostly used by the wealthiest of the wealthy.</p> <p>The SFO\u2019s sole function is to centralize the management of a family fortune. SFO staff manage investments, taxes, philanthropic activities, trusts, and legal matters. SFOs are privately owned by high-net-worth families, so not much information on them is available to the public. Prominent SFOs include Willett Advisors, which invests the personal and philanthropic assets of Michael Bloomberg; the Heinz Family Office; and SAFO (Shari Arison Family Office) Investment Company.</p> <p>6. Endowments and Foundations</p> <p>Endowments and foundations (E&amp;Fs) are large pools of money that benefit a specific charitable cause. Endowments tend to serve educational institutions while foundations write grants for a wide range of causes.</p> <p>In the United States, 805 college and university endowments and affiliated foundations collectively had over $515 billion in endowment assets, according to the 2016 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments. A further\u00a0$865 billion is held by foundations, according to the\u00a0Foundation Center\u2019s database. E&amp;Fs pay out on average 4%\u20135% of AUM each year to their specific cause.</p> <p>No asset owner has a longer time horizon or is able to assume greater risk. E&amp;Fs have a perpetual life and no defined liability stream, which led to the evolution of the alternatives-heavy \u201cEndowment Model\u201d popularized by Yale University\u2019s David Swensen. David Chambers and Elroy Dimson explored the origins and evolution of this model in a recent article for the CFA Institute Financial Analysts Journal\u00ae. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is the world\u2019s largest foundation, while Harvard University has the largest endowment.</p> <p>7. Multi-Family Offices</p> <p>There are an estimated 150 multi-family offices (MFOs) in the United States with about $400 to $450 billion in AUM, according to Capgemini\u2019s \u201cGlobal State of Family Offices Report.\u201d They provide\u00a0a range of services similar to an SFO, but work with more than one family group. These services are available to wealthy clients with as \u201clittle\u201d as $20 million in investable assets.</p> <p>A MFO typically offers comprehensive investment solutions to affluent individuals and families, with some also handling other financial matters, including budgeting, insurance, wealth transfer, and tax services. Some notable MFOs are Bessemer Trust and Rockefeller &amp; Co.</p> <p>Moving Forward</p> <p>Many aspects of the investment landscape are set to change, but these asset owners are likely to remain at the center of the market for many years to come. So if you still have questions, Owen Concannon, CFA\u2019s exploration of the asset management industry\u00a0may be the next place to look.</p> <p>There\u2019s no substitute for primary sources, though, so we hope you\u2019ll\u00a0come meet us in person at your local CFA Society to find out why.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["asset owners","investment industry","economic geography"]},{"location":"blog/2018/02/23/ski-fast-have-fun-dont-fall-down/","title":"Ski Fast, Have Fun, Don't Fall Down","text":"<p>Ski racing is the kind of sport that stays with you.</p> <p>It takes the form of weaker knees and troubled joints sometimes, but something special comes from trying your best to do something very hard.</p> <p>Bill Pennington recently wrote about the culture of Norway\u2019s ski team in The New York Times, and it got me thinking: What can you really do to help an athlete win?</p> <p>The piece\u2019s headline \u2014 \u201cThe Ski Team That Sleeps Together Wins a Lot of Gold Medals Together\u201d \u2014 implies a cuddle-centric strategy that fortunately is not the secret. Sharing beds is common for budget-strapped skiers, but a structure that deepens their relationships with teammates is not.</p> <p>Pennington details five rules that fit pretty well into organizations both on and off the hill. Here\u2019s the secret sauce:</p> <ol> <li>No jerks.</li> <li>No class structure.</li> <li>The social fabric of the group is paramount.</li> <li>Talk to each other, not about each other.</li> <li>Friday night is taco night.</li> </ol> <p>This recipe got six of their athletes ranked in the world\u2019s top 30 at the same time. And at some level, sign me up. I am here for taco night in a way that I can be only for my closest friends.</p> <p>But why is this such an ideal structure to grow in, and what can we learn from it that\u2019s useful beyond entertainment?</p> <p>I was never going to carry the Olympic flag, but I did spend more than a decade as an alpine ski racer and coach. It\u2019s a craft, much like investing, and it takes a specific atmosphere to flourish.</p> <p>I had the tremendous luck to learn under two legendary coaches: Carl Williams, who coached the Salisbury Ski Team for 45 Years, and Ron Bonneau, who took at least one of the College of Idaho\u2019s teams to nationals every year from 1999 to 2011 and was deservedly named US Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) Coach of the Year in 2016. Carl has passed away and it\u2019s been a while since I caught up with Ron, but it\u2019s a safe bet both would endorse the framework.</p> <p>These cultural factors are critical because ski racing is not a strictly pleasant experience. Remember: The goal of the\u00a0sport is to go as fast as possible, often on the most dangerous part of the mountain. It will get icy, and then the ice will find ways to get even worse. It changes speed, catches skis, and grows ruts just to demonstrate character. As you improve, you are hitting a gate with your body at almost every turn. This leaves bruises and brittle plastic behind. When you\u2019re done, you take off your skis, walk up the hill, and ski it again.</p> <p>And your feet are cold the whole time.</p> <p>So, in honor of the Winter Olympics and the athletes who prosper in chilly, challenging conditions, I thought I\u2019d explore three of the big lessons I learned on the hill before launching into the usual weekend menu of links.</p> <p>1. \u201cBend ze Knees und ze Ankles\u201d</p> <p>During Carl Williams\u2019s career, the sport of skiing changed as much as anything else in the world.</p> <p>He started coaching for Salisbury in 1965, which means not only straight skis but also plenty of colleagues from abroad. Apart from the US Army\u2019s 10th Mountain Division, there weren\u2019t many Americans who could link turns.</p> <p>Of course, there\u2019s a limit to how much experience you can import, and that\u2019s how this came to be a catchphrase. I still crack up thinking of Carl describing teams of Austrians giving up on their American students after the exhortation to bend didn\u2019t quite take. His impression of their frustration became something we repeated to each other out of intrinsic value \u2014 this was high school, after all \u2014 but the message is really important. There\u2019s no point having the best of the best as instructors if you don\u2019t speak the same language.</p> <p>2. Expect the Best Day Ever</p> <p>Ron Bonneau asked if I was breathing at the end of one of my first practice runs in college.</p> <p>\u201cOh wow, I\u2019m not making this team\u201d was my immediate thought. But his point was that I wasn\u2019t going to win anything all stressed out. Racers at the peak of their capabilities still need to overcome their mood. For Ron, the secret to winning was remembering why you are competing: It\u2019s fun.</p> <p>This is really easy to forget! Remember the bit above about bruises? The added intensity that comes with competing at the college level makes it easy to burn out.</p> <p>If you can convince yourself that the day ahead of you could be your best ever, it\u2019s a little easier to keep moving.</p> <p>3. Ski Fast, Have Fun, Don\u2019t Fall Down</p> <p>Carl saw plenty of disruptive innovation on the hill: plastic ski boots, breakaway gates, heel release bindings, and shaped skis. But there\u2019s a central truth to the undertaking which never changed a bit, and so I\u2019m pretty confident he shared the same secret recipe each successive year.</p> <p>It\u2019s easier said than done, but that\u2019s sort of the point. Advice always works that way. But the happy-go-lucky attitude at the center of it has helped me in situations far beyond the back bowls of Butternut Basin where we trained.</p> <p>My thanks to Carl, to Ron, to all the teammates I shared their wisdom with, and to you for indulging me. Now, as promised, here are some links that I think you\u2019ll enjoy.</p> <p>Keep the optimistic spirit above in mind when I say: This might be the weekend when you finally \u201cget\u201d cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Give these a look if that sounds fun:</p> <ul> <li>\u201c\u2018Know When to Hodl \u2018Em, Know When to Fodl \u2018Em\u2019: An Investigation of Factor Based Investing in the Cryptocurrency Space\u201d\u00a0(SSRN)</li> <li>\u201cFrom a technical standpoint: Why does every blockchain projects need their own coins?\u201d (reddit.com/r/cryptotechnology)</li> <li>\u201cMaybe Journalists Need to Own a Little Bitcoin\u201d (Bloomberg View)</li> <li>\u201cThe Technology and Economic Determinants of Cryptocurrency Exchange Rates: The Case of Bitcoin\u201d\u00a0(Decision Support Systems)</li> <li>\u201cCan We Stabilize the Price of a Cryptocurrency?: Understanding the Design of Bitcoin and Its Potential to Compete with Central Bank Money\u201d (SSRN)</li> </ul>","tags":["crypto","ski racing"]},{"location":"blog/2018/02/28/nine-charts-dangerous-curves/","title":"Nine Charts: Dangerous Curves","text":"<p>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.</p> <p>The prospect of rising interest rates has been discussed for long enough that every investor on earth ought to be ready by now.</p> <p>Of course, that\u2019s not exactly how it works.</p> <p>To many in the market, bonds play a nearly sacred role.

The bold emphasis is mine.</p> <p>\u201cThe results suggest that for strategies pursuing mean reversion in the absolute level of yields, neither the strategy based on mean reversion of average yield levels across the curve nor that based on yield levels at individual maturity points can offer consistently superior returns. For strategies pursuing mean reversion in the slope of the yield curve, the authors find that trades involving mean reversion across the yield curve cannot offer consistently superior returns, although, conversely, those involving mean reversion between just two adjacent points on the yield curve can. For strategies pursuing mean reversion in the curvature of the yield curve, both trades involving curvature across the curve and those involving the curvature of just three adjoining points on the curve are found to offer consistently superior returns. Finally, the authors find that the most consistently profitable and statistically robust of all the strategies is that which pursues mean reversion of the slope between two adjacent points of the yield curve.</p> <p>Best of luck out there, and thank you for reading.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["charts","yield curve"]},{"location":"blog/2018/03/05/weird-ideas-conference/","title":"Weird Ideas Conference","text":"<p>I\u2019m thinking about organizing a weird ideas conference.</p> <p>Its mission would be to embolden open curiosity in the field of investment management.

Since the nation gained independence from Pakistan in 1971, development indicators there have improved dramatically. Women have fewer children and greater individual agency. Infant mortality is way down and life expectancy way up. GDP growth in 2016 exceeded 7%.</p> <p>The two of us first met there in early 2017, and recently reconnected to discuss the stunning situation we detail here.</p> <p>Interest Ranges. </p> <p>The story starts with a typically minor technical issue: What\u2019s the interest rate in Bangladesh?</p> <p>In most places, fixed-income analysts can relate coupons on debt instruments to each other and infer their relative riskiness with straightforward math.</p> <p>This has never been as tidy in Dhaka, Bangladesh, as it is in New York or London, but it recently became impossible after the government stopped holding periodic bond auctions.</p> <p>This means the largest issuer in the capital markets \u2014 the government \u2014 has effectively abandoned them.</p> <p>This is more than just a petty annoyance. It makes the price of money both higher and harder to calculate. In a country where boosting entrepreneurship, building infrastructure, and creating jobs are pressing imperatives, it counts as a significant headwind at best.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not the whole problem.</p> <p>Working Too Well</p> <p>Bangladesh\u2019s National Savings Department (NSD) has the right idea: Make it easier for people to save by offering convenient, safe, and attractive deposits at preferential interest rates.</p> <p>The NSD was established in 1972, right after independence, in order to promote savings, help fill fiscal deficits, reduce dependence on foreign donors, and provide a safety net to women, retired officials, senior citizens, and the physically challenged.</p> <p>The savings certificates the NSD offers can be purchased from commercial banks as well as the postal service, which played a big role in financial inclusion during the early days of independence.</p> <p>People have noticed.</p> <p>Bangladeshi Debt Outsanding (Billions of Taka)</p> <p></p> <p>Source: All charts derived from Bangladesh Bank data</p> <p>If the right people were accessing the program, this wouldn\u2019t be so bad. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that\u2019s the case.</p> <p>Statistics on who is using these instruments are not public, but large institutions and wealthy individuals are likely buying a disproportionate share. A family of two is currently allowed to invest 16.5-million Bangladeshi taka in total, or about $199,000, in these products, and there are ways to bypass restrictions by investing under the names of other family members.</p> <p>This in a country where the per capita income in fiscal 2017 was $1,610.</p> <p>And don\u2019t forget, these instruments are among the highest-yielding options available to savers. By definition, that makes them among the most expensive financing vehicles available to the government.</p> <p>Bangladeshi Interest Rates</p> <p></p> <p>Of the country\u2019s 2017 budget deficit, about 16.6% was attributable to interest on NSD savings certificates. And unless the program is reformed, that percentage will only continue to grow. Spreads between NSD instruments and market rate alternatives are so wide that adding up the total cost is just sad.</p> <p>That money could be put to much better use elsewhere.</p> <p>But indirect costs are also part of the tragedy. This program has starved the banking sector of deposits, as demonstrated by the widening the gap between the M2 and M3 growth rates.</p> <p>Bangladesh Money Supply Growth Rates, Year-over-Year Change</p> <p></p> <p>This can be changed. </p> <p>The good news is that we know how to close the\u00a0budget deficit in Bangladesh.</p> <p>The question is: Will things change?</p> <p>Eight million Bangladeshis have moved out of poverty since 2010, according to the World Bank. The savings from reform \u2014 which would be significant \u2014 could meaningfully accelerate that trend.</p> <p>Restoring health to the capital markets is required to sustain them. If NSD certificates were restricted to more reasonable investments amounts, say 10 lakh taka, or around $12,000, a number of good things would likely begin to happen.</p> <p>Among the best is that subsidies could be directed away from the wealthy and toward those who really need them.</p> <p>If you liked this post, you should subscribe to my newsletter.</p>","tags":["frontier markets","bangladesh","economic development"]},{"location":"blog/2018/05/04/billions-of-reasons-to-be-yourself/","title":"Billions of Reasons to Be Yourself","text":"<p>Showtime\u2019s Billions is one of the best shows on television.</p> <p>It blends excellent storytelling, great acting and writing, and a keen sense for its focal point, Axe Capital, a Connecticut hedge fund.</p> <p>We don\u2019t often see fund management on the small screen. But\u00a0Billions\u00a0has also brought something else unusual: Asia Kate Dillon\u2019s portrayal of Taylor Mason.</p> <p>Both the character and the person who plays them is non-binary, meaning they don\u2019t identify as either male or female. What\u2019s striking about this is not just the boundary-busting they\u2019ve done, but also the speed with which their colleagues accept their identity, pronouns, and personhood. When Taylor comes out to their boss, the reaction is \u201cYou know, the difference in you is actually your advantage.\u201d</p> <p>So where is the real-life Taylor? I\u2019d wager the answer is simple: hiding in plain sight.</p> <p>There is tremendous pressure to keep what makes us different a secret in the workplace. NYU School of Law and Deloitte surveyed 3,129 professionals and found that 61% take action to cover up at least one element of their personality, whether that means straightening their hair to de-emphasize race, avoiding discussions about motherhood to appear more committed at work, or refraining from bringing a same-sex partner to a work function.</p> <p>The authors also found:</p> <p>\u201c45 percent of straight White men \u2014 who have not been the focus of most inclusion efforts \u2014 reported covering. This finding seems particularly promising, given that a model of inclusion should, almost by definition, be one in which all individuals can see themselves.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019ll take more than saying it to make it so, but it\u2019s a start. Why does that problem seem so hard, though? Being effective takes empathy no matter who you work with. But too often human beings are met with raised eyebrows instead of open arms when they find the courage to stop covering.</p> <p>That\u2019s too bad, and not just for the people left to go it alone. Monocultural firms can only scale so far. And when co-workers see a colleague separate from their employer because of a characteristic, the best-case scenario is that they just feel a little uneasy as a result. The worst is that such action allows bias to calcify into blindness or even bigotry.</p> <p>When I came out to my colleagues as a transgender woman in October of last year, one of the things I said was, \u201cIf you can respect me as a human, seeing me as a woman is a matter of time.\u201d</p> <p>That time has come quickly, and my boldest hope is that it will come for you if you\u2019d like it to. I know what it\u2019s like to feel my dignity is contingent on keeping my immutable characteristics secret. It hurt the whole time I was trying, and I\u2019ve never been gladder to give something up.</p> <p>Everyone ought to be so lucky no matter what they don\u2019t feel able to say.

Ten years later, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s chief economist observed that the need for continued work had become an item of widespread political consensus. To place the change in context, consider that the weighted average tariff on an imported product was 76% in 1990 according to the World Bank. It was 29% a decade later, and 6.2% in 2016.</p> <p>That\u2019s more a rebirth than a liberalization.</p> <p>These compounding efforts have a straightforward result: India isn\u2019t playing catch-up anymore. It\u2019s the world\u2019s seventh-largest economy, and in some ways it\u2019s already well ahead of \u201cdeveloped\u201d places.</p> <p>In early 2017, Sloane Ortel estimated that a minimum wage earner in New York City spends 1.5% to 2.5% of their discretionary income on banking fees. In India, anything above 0% is an outlier. The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY, Scheme for People\u2019s Wealth) provides not just free bank accounts to all citizens, but also free overdraft insurance. That makes capital formation easier, and it\u2019s just one of a few hundred reasons why 8% GDP growth seems plausible for the next 20 years.</p> <p>Indian inflation has bottomed, and looks likely to rise further. pic.twitter.com/LabNtgQMqi</p>\u2014 Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) May 30, 2018 <p>So don\u2019t be surprised if the economy starts running a little hot.</p> <p>India\u2019s inflation rate printed below 2% in the summer of 2017, but has since risen significantly. The most recent release puts consumer prices up 4.58% from a year ago, and the year-on-year change has been well above the RBI\u2019s target of 4% since November of last year.</p> <p>The 1 July 2017 introduction of the national Goods and Services Tax (GST) is not least among its drivers. The 18% tax it collects on services is a significant hike from the 14.5% duty that was previously imposed on 28% of the CPI basket.</p> <p>Fiscal policy is also likely to be accommodative until elections to India\u2019s lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, in spring 2019. Local and national government social and infrastructure spending tends to spike in these pre-election periods.</p> <p>India's manufacturers face a crude reality. pic.twitter.com/JwiWxVHTTT</p>\u2014 Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) May 30, 2018 <p>And of course, there are commodity prices.</p> <p>India imports 86% of its crude oil requirement: about 1.5 billion barrels each year. That means rising crude prices have nearly a one-on-one impact on India\u2019s import bill.</p> <p>It\u2019s less stark than it seems at first. Refined petroleum is India\u2019s largest single export. The country sent 207 million barrels abroad in 2016, making it the world\u2019s fifth-largest supplier behind the Netherlands and netting $29.5 billion, 9% of the country\u2019s total export trade.</p> <p>For the Indian consumer, oil prices never fell. The government responded to the 2015 selloff by raising taxes on diesel and petrol. This increases reserves and can always be cut in the future. It\u2019s also a footnote compared to some of the government\u2019s other policy reforms.</p> <p>This is what an economic transformation looks like. pic.twitter.com/a3RtgqrcTa</p>\u2014 Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) May 30, 2018 <p>The informal sector accounts for roughly 40% of India\u2019s 2017 output and employs almost 80% of its labor force.</p> <p>The government seems determined to get rid of it.</p> <p>India has digitized its financial plumbing, cracked down on cash, and issued a new national tax scheme largely to tamp out \u201cblack\u201d money, or untaxed earnings on the black market. Many of these businesses are relatively low quality, and can be expected to lose share or cease operating without the ability to flout wage laws and avoid taxes.</p> <p>This is a tailwind for listed companies. Market leading franchises have long been gaining share from these informal operators. Soon they will operate in a uniform national market with much less illicit competition.</p> <p>Indians are starting to discover their domestic capital markets.Chart via @SunilBSinghania pic.twitter.com/o5OHkdVjzR</p>\u2014 Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) May 30, 2018 <p>The money habits of individual Indians are also headed for a significant change.</p> <p>About 95% of India\u2019s wealth is invested in physical assets: 77% in real estate with the balance in durable goods (7%), and gold (11%).</p> <p>The remaining 5% is invested in financial assets. This share is already growing and looks set to go further. Households put 45% of their income into financial assets in 2012. The proportion is now around 58% and looks poised for more expanision.</p> <p>This will materially strengthen India\u2019s capital account if it continues.</p> <p>Not all borrowers pay their bills. pic.twitter.com/2fXRs1KUSX</p>\u2014 Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) May 30, 2018 <p>There are risks to the rosy outlook, of course.</p> <p>A primary one is the sometimes lackluster credit discipline of Indian lenders.\u00a0\u201cIndia\u2019s bad loan/twin balance-sheet problem is widely known and so far intractable,\u201d\u00a0David Keohane wrote\u00a0last year.</p> <p>Historically, Indian companies have been weighed down by debt-laden balance sheets and the public sector banks that have financed them have been saddled with non-performing assets. In large part, this is because India\u2019s bankruptcy code did not make it easy for creditors to reach economically viable arrangements. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016 has materially strengthened the insolvency framework with an efficient legal structure to enforce debt service obligations.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to overstate the importance of this. The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA)\u00a0estimated that India\u2019s corporate bond market was worth about 15% of\u00a0 GDP in 2017. That\u2019s tripled from 5% five years earlier, but is still much lower than neighboring Malaysia, where outstanding corporate bonds were worth 40% of GDP. Deepening this market will help to finance much-needed infrastructure projects and also provide banks with a bit more breathing room.</p> <p>There are plenty of reasons to hope it works, but it may be a process. About two weeks ago, a Reuters headline blared, \u201cIndia State Banks\u2019 Bailout Stumbles as Losses Mount.\u201d And Moody\u2019s just cut their estimate for India\u2019s 2018 GDP, citing a combination of higher oil prices and tighter financial conditions.</p> <p>Accounting quality drives investment performance in India. pic.twitter.com/GZyRubg2qr</p>\u2014 Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) May 30, 2018 <p>And then there\u2019s the same old risk: Investing is hard.</p> <p>Finding multibagger investments in India is a tricky affair because accounting quality and corporate governance standards vary wildly across companies and over 60% of the market cap of the frontline index, the NIFTY, is in highly regulated sectors like banks, telecoms, metals, power, infrastructure, and pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>However, India had 5,615 listed companies in 2017, according to the World Bank. That\u2019s more than any other market on the planet: The United States had just 4,336. The top decile of these firms has historically delivered 10-times returns over 10-year horizons.</p> <p>That\u2019s a 25% compound annual growth rate. Foreign investors have participated in this growth story enthusiastically, which has kept India among the most expensive emerging markets based on trailing price/earnings multiples.</p> <p>There's plenty of room for India's corporate profits to grow.Chart via @SunilBSinghania pic.twitter.com/ZlzvR8kbRr</p>\u2014 Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) May 30, 2018 <p>The standard question to ponder towards the conclusion of an article like this is: What inning are we in?</p> <p>In India, though, the game is cricket, not baseball. One inning can last as long as four baseball games, and there are either two or four of them. The longest game in history lasted nine days. And that\u2019s really the point. An allocator encountering India today faces an unusual and alluring confluence of factors.

The allure of working with alternative data could make it a common point of agreement in the process of building support for new initiatives internally, and the\u00a0learning from efforts to integrate it can drive significant\u00a0future innovation.</p> <p>The work isn\u2019t necessarily all that different from what you do already. For instance, consider:</p> <ul> <li>Assessing the strength of a potential general partner\u2019s professional and social network with LinkedIn data and news reports of prior deals before committing to their fund.\u00a0An allocator is likely to have little ex ante clarity about the specific start-up companies in which a venture capitalist will invest, and no control over how it does so once capital is pledged.

Here are a few examples:</p> <ul> <li>Ensure your cost structure is not a simple function of market capitalization by continuously monitoring contracts with external asset managers. Fee structures based on assets under management (AUM) can creep into costs because growth in an account balance does not necessarily reflect manager skill.</li> <li>Inventive collation and synthesis of documents like e-mails, investment memos, and contracts can uncover precious metadata with insight into communication, culture, negotiation, time allocation, benchmarking, and diligence.</li> <li>Organizations can map their internal knowledge flows by tracking how internal users query and access documents in organizational databases. This also allows for examinations of typical approaches analysts use in problem solving. More granular visibility into these activities can expose not only areas for improvement, but also help better identify best practices.</li> </ul> <p>Everyone faces technological competition.</p> <p>Strategically, this means that investment organizations can invest in homegrown sources of technological leverage, and they ought to. If they don\u2019t, the decision should come after a thorough analysis of long-term tradeoffs to the organization.</p> <p>From these seats, it\u2019s hard to imagine a winning case against it.

It was first published on the Enterprising Investor. </p> <p>The standard joke about high-yield bonds is that they\u2019re not high yield any longer.</p> <p>People started to tell that joke when the high-yield index fell below 10%. They\u2019ve continued revising it as the index has moved steadily downward to its present 6%.</p> <p>So let\u2019s replace it with a much better joke: A bond manager has to appear in traffic court for a moving violation. The judge asks, \u201cDon\u2019t you know what \u2018yield\u2019 means?\u201d\u00a0The bond manager replies, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since there\u2019s been any, I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>The judge begins to lecture him: \u201cIt\u2019s every citizen\u2019s duty in our society to understand the laws and obey them. It\u2019s a sacred covenant.\u201d The bond manager interjects, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that last part.\u201d</p> <p>This joke evoked a chuckle from the audience at\u00a0CFA Society New York\u2019s 28th Annual High Yield Bond Conference. Martin Fridson, CFA,\u00a0has been organizing and moderating the event for its entire history, starting back \u201cwhen\u00a0government bonds were yielding 9% and a respectable high yield credit could be found yielding around 14%.\u201d Attendees have come to expect a mix of quirky humor, tactical insight, and portfolio management wisdom.</p> <p>Enterprising Investor\u00a0and CFA Society New York hope to transmit healthy doses of each through this experimental format.</p> <p>What follows are 13 charts interspersed with related commentary from panelists throughout the event.\u00a0To be clear: These quotes are from 13 and 14 June 2018 at the CFA Society of New York.

There are also a lot more rated issuers in total than 2009.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Robert Schulz, CFA, managing director, corporate ratings, S&amp;P Global Ratings</li> <li>\u201cThe investment grade market has grown 40% over the last four years. The HY market has shrunk since 2015, and its overall credit quality has improved.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Riz Hussain, director, US high-yield credit strategy, Barclays Capital</li> <li>\u201cUsually, things are never at the average. When defaults start spiking, they spike to double digits. A \u2018non-recessionary\u2019 average default rate for bonds is 2.3%. We don\u2019t see anything at Fitch that leads us to believe the cycle is going to turn into a spike over the next year.\u201d (Editor: Fitch\u2019s work put the high-yield default rate at 1.8% in 2017.)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sharon Bonelli, managing director, Fitch Ratings</li> <li>\u201cThere\u2019s no question [default rates] are very low. People talk about this as \u2018We\u2019re in the 13th inning of a credit cycle.'\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0George Varughese, managing director, Alvarez &amp; Marsal</li> <li>\u201cOur view is that money will be shifting from US to a more global situation over the next few years. Right now we\u2019re getting to the unusual position where you don\u2019t have a pickup from local EM into high yield. There\u2019s an embedded view on the dollar, but that opportunity to swap into EM is a pretty compelling one from a total return standpoint.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Henry Peabody, CFA, vice president, multi-sector portfolio manager, Eaton Vance Management</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\u201cAlmost one third of the market was expected to default during the credit crisis because of their near-term maturities. Most companies now want to extend their runways. [They] are going out five, six, seven years. When rates start rising, you wind up getting more tenders. High-yield companies withstand rising rates better than expected because of that.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Anne Yobage, CFA, director/co-founder, SKY Harbor Capital Management</li> <li>\u201cIf you think about the financing cycle we\u2019ve had this last few years, high-yield companies have built this incredible runway which means it will take some time for issuers to pay higher coupons. . . . I think the loan index coupon actually fell by 40 basis points this year. . . . [Rising interest rates] will certainly affect lower-quality issuers the most because they have more floating rate notes.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Martha Metcalf, CFA, senior portfolio manager, Schroders Investment Management</li> <li>\u201cThe shift we\u2019ve seen over the past year to the Fed not giving you a get-out-of-jail-free card, the ECB not backing down as Italy gets volatility.\u00a0We\u2019re more nervous about rates than others. We don\u2019t see a 10-year Treasury north of 5% as crazy, and people are asking if there\u2019s value in the front end, if a 2.5% two year is sucking attention away from other credits.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Henry Peabody, CFA</li> <li>\u201cIf rates are going up because earnings are going up, most of the market will be just fine. From a total return basis, it gets back to bonds and what\u2019s investable. High yield has a strong record of outperformance when interest rates are rising. Over the past 20 years, there have been 16 50 basis point hike cycles.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Kevin Lorenz, CFA,\u00a0managing director/portfolio manager, TIAA</li> <li>\u201cThis late in the cycle, you\u2019re really down to the relative value argument. The opportunistic buyer has definitely stepped back. Fundamentals are supportive, technicals are in balance, but valuations are stretched here.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Martha Metcalf, CFA</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>What does a flattening yield curve mean? \u201cThe strongest relationship is between 2s10s and the 3yr forward default rate. So the oft-forecast crisis via rates is likely to happen in 2021.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Riz Hussain</li> <li>\u201cRight now, we have to defend the asset category. We\u2019re at\u00a0historical tights, so a lot of clients think there\u2019s nowhere good to go from here.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Anne Yobage, CFA</li> <li>\u201cWe like the B part of the market probably the most. Five to 6%, two- to five-year maturity is our sweet spot.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Anne Yobage, CFA</li> <li>\u201cWe\u2019re more focused on B and CCC, but partially offset with investment-grade exposures, because we found that we could find large-cap BBB entities with higher yields than BB. Subordinated paper from [for instance] JP Morgan has more liquidity, plus a [yield] pickup. And in contrast to what we\u2019ve said about high yield, supply in investment grade has been quite good this year.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Martha Metcalf, CFA</li> <li>\u201cYou don\u2019t get paid two or three times the Treasury base rate for absolute certainty.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Wayne Plewniak, managing director/portfolio manager, Gabelli &amp; Company.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\u201cIt used to be that credit had a very tight correlation with rates.\u201d \u2014 Sam Derosa-Farag, market strategist</li> <li>\u201cWe\u2019re quite positive on the credit cycle. We think it still has long legs here. We are very comfortable moving down in credit quality for that reason: We think we\u2019ve experienced much of the major headwinds already in the high-yield market.\u00a0We are looking for a 5% year for both full duration and short duration products.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Anne Yobage, CFA</li> <li>\u201cWe are constructive on high yield overall. From a strategic vantage point, spreads are top-decile narrow, top 30% over the last 20 years. Put those two together and look at it by credit rating. If you back out credit-risk premia, historically BB has provided very strong risk-adjusted returns. We think they will continue to do so.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Kevin Lorenz, CFA</li> <li>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be enthusiastic about valuations. Leverage is extended, even though backward-looking interest coverage is solid. Technicals have been very strong. We do get the sense, at least in the near term, that foreign participation is backing away.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Henry Peabody, CFA</li> <li>\u201cMaybe equity valuations are too high, and if they are, that\u2019s going to be felt across all asset classes.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Kevin Lorenz, CFA</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\u201cThe average high-yield new issue is worse than average because companies come to market opportunistically.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Martin Fridson, CFA, chief investment officer, Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors</li> <li>\u201cYou should be willing to move between acting as an owner and acting as a creditor if you are buying these assets.\u201d \u2014\u00a0George Varughese</li> <li>\u201cWe cut our forecast for new issue supply by $40B, which puts it\u00a0as low as it was in 2009\u201310.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Riz Hussain</li> <li>\u201cWe tend to think there\u2019s a pretty good correlation between volatility spikes and slowdowns in the new issuance calendar.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Jarrod Kaplan, director, Credit Agricole Securities CIB</li> <li>\u201cSeventy percent or so of high-yield proceeds has been used for refinancing . . . that\u2019s the highest since 2007.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Riz Hussain</li> <li>\u201cWe have the luxury of avoiding the new issue market . . . . Generally what\u2019s new issue today is what you want to buy in one or two years. Bankers aren\u2019t in the business of enriching investors, they work for their clients.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Henry Peabody, CFA</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\u201cSeventy-seven percent of the floating-rate loan market is considered \u2018covenant lite.\u2019 Leverage through the first lien part of the capital structure is about as high as it\u2019s ever been. Relative to high yield, there are some concerns about credit quality. We\u2019ve seen a 20% increase in capital structures that are loan only, and\u00a058% of loan issuers are loans only. That means a majority of loan issuers today don\u2019t have bonds below them.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Riz Hussain</li> <li>\u201cWhen [abuses of covenants] happen, the company is simply doing what the documents allow them to do. And shame on us, shame on the investment community, for letting that happen.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0George Varughese</li> <li>\u201cThe recovery experience will be much different than it\u2019s been historically.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Martha Metcalf, CFA</li> <li>\u201cBack in the mid 2000s, the structures got very esoteric. Each deal was unique. It still worked out in the end. Contrast that to today, where every deal is pretty much boilerplate. But the point that keeps getting made is that cov-lite is going to hurt.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Kevin Lorenz, CFA</li> <li>\u201cYou have to really trust that management teams have your interests at heart . . . \u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Anne Yobage, CFA</li> <li>\u201cAnd they don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Kevin Lorenz, CFA</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\u201cWe invest across bonds and loans. In our mutual fund, loan exposure has ranged from 0 to 20%, and today it\u2019s at 7%. Everything we buy is based on bottom-up credit views. The problem we\u2019ve had in the loan market is one of repricing. It is just getting too rich for us.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Kevin Lorenz, CFA</li> <li>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the most late-cycle behavior in the loan market. It won\u2019t be a catalyst for defaults but it will affect the recovery experience . . . .\u00a0I heard a CLO manager say that covenants don\u2019t pay coupon, cash flow does.\u201d \u2014 Martha Metcalf, CFA</li> <li>\u201cNow is an excellent time to be in active management . . . you need to treat the market with caution and go in with a deep fundamental view.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Henry Peabody, CFA</li> <li>\u201cDispersion is sitting at the lows. Positioning suggests caution. Dealer inventories are basically flat. High-yield CDX positioning is basically flat. Mutual fund manager performance this year is really narrowly distributed.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Riz Hussain</li> <li>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen deals in 2018 with a seven-plus year maturity, though still no longer than eight. For instance: Iron Mountain, Vista Energy, Telenet. There\u2019s a\u00a0continued loosening of terms. The market is getting more aggressive. The\u00a0depth of the second lien loan market is increasing with large \u2018bond-size\u2019 placements readily achievable. Two to $5 billion enterprise value LBOs, where you would tend to need a junior piece to be a high-yield bond, [can now be funded with] first and second lien loans.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Jarrod Kaplan</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\u201cHYG and JNK have much higher flow volatility than what the price volatility would suggest. Managers have increasingly been using ETFs to take tactical views, but also to manage liquidity overall. That means you can\u2019t look at ETF flows as additive to mutual fund flows.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Riz Hussain</li> <li>\u201cETFs are 3.4% of the US HY market.\u00a0All 45 high-yield ETFs trade 15.7% of 3m average daily volume in total market. The largest premium/discount to underlying was ~.3%/-~.4% on the five most stressed days.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Bradley Kotler, vice president, SPDR Fixed Income Group, State Street Global Advisors</li> <li>\u201cWe see ETFs as enhancing the liquidity process. As a seller,\u00a0you\u2019re getting the greater of the liquidity in the underlying or the ETF.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sal Bruno, chief investment officer, IndexIQ</li> <li>\u201cOn Columbus Day, there was $1 billion in volume for JNK even though the bond market wasn\u2019t open.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Bradley Kotler</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\u201cWe are very underweight retail. We like the telecom space a lot. Basic industries and housing are very strong areas too.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Anne Yobage, CFA</li> <li>\u201cRetail bankruptcies, most of the time, end up in liquidations. Most of the lending to a retail company is typically done on an asset-based basis on inventory and receivables. Because of Amazon and many other things, brick-and-mortar business models are under attack. So when a bankruptcy happens, a secured lender is best able to get a recovery by liquidating the receivables and inventory instead of assuming the business risk. Most of the time the secured creditor wins because they have a lien to the assets. Not true in all cases: Many retail companies have emerged from bankruptcy and continued to be companies afterward.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0George Varughese</li> <li>Retail is \u201cthe most active in terms of defaults these days, the total 12-month default rate for retail is about 9% on the high-yield side.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sharon Bonelli</li> <li>\u201cIndividual sectors have been strained, but it hasn\u2019t spilled over to the broader market.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0George Varughese</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve taken many ratings actions based on tax reform.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Robert Schulz, CFA</li> <li>\u201cAbout 40% of public high-yield issuers have interest coverage below 3.3x.

We never know when the next recession will arrive, but with each month that elapses since the last recession, we know with certainty that we\u2019re one month closer to the next one. Logically, therefore, the multiples of debt piled on an LBO should decrease as we get closer to the next recession and there is consequently less time to bring leverage down. What we actually observe, however, is that multiples increase as the economy gets closer to the next recession. This cannot be wise corporate financial policy.\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Martin Fridson, CFA</li> <li>\u201cAre we late cycle?

The Journal had an article this morning that the average deal was 6x EBITDA . . . that must be adjusted EBITDA.

You totally don\u2019t need to. Most Americans, at least, have access to a free checking account that offers many of the features we closely associate with a traditional investment account: secure storage of and access to money.</p> <p>It\u2019s not farfetched to ask the same question about an investment account and provide the same answer. Particularly for investors who own index funds (or \u201ccloset index\u201d funds with low\u00a0active shares), it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that there is no need to pay significant fees for a diversified portfolio. Vanguard has long offered target date funds that combine their low-cost index offerings, but Charles Schwab\u2019s \u201cIntelligent\u201d portfolios, which do not have associated fees, are a harbinger of what is to come.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already said that in the fight against algorithmic investment services, financial advisers \u201chad better compete on something other than cost, accuracy, and speed\u201d but haven\u2019t yet taken that analysis further. My colleague Lauren Foster has noted that robo-advisers and financial advisers\u00a0had better start getting along, but I will state that more strongly.</p> <p>Charging for Non-Differentiated Investment Products Is About to Get Very Hard.</p> <p>If you are selling the same thing as everyone else, and that thing is infinitely scalable at minuscule marginal cost \u2014 like many equity index funds \u2014 there is little reason for someone to pay you for it. A preponderance of services have evolved to combine various low-cost investments into \u201ccustomized\u201d investment portfolios, but those products have essentially the same characteristics. The algorithms that combine the products are as scalable as the products themselves.</p> <p>This leads to a competitive dynamic that is easy to name but difficult to survive: a race to the bottom. Vanguard\u2019s ownership framework,\u00a0which is not designed to earn a profit, seems to be structured in anticipation of this competitive dynamic.</p> <p>There is not going to be only one firm providing low-cost index funds, but it is difficult to imagine a true need for the hundreds of them that exist now. In 2012,\u00a0Business Insider\u00a0did a survey of S&amp;P 500 index funds\u00a0and found that Vanguard effectively dominated its competition. Businesses attempting to extract excess fee income from either these non-differentiated funds or the construction of a portfolio comprised of them will have a difficult time justifying their existence.</p> <p>So Are Professional Investment Managers Going Away?</p> <p>No way. Fortunately for investment professionals, we are not selling\u00a0buggy whips. As long as there are organizations and individuals with money, there will be a market for figuring out what to do with it. That market is simply evolving, which is why Lauren\u2019s framing of the next step for advisers as \u201cgetting on the right side\u201d of the trend is so perceptive.</p> <p>I have personally never been more bullish on the future of the investment profession, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to look the same. It\u2019s unlikely that there will be many highly paid employees doing work that could easily be performed by algorithms in the years to come. Instead, look for small teams of investment professionals to be levered as never before by software. To me, it seems like there will still be ample room to provide products along one of three lines:</p> <ul> <li>Personality: A more pleasant interface to money management than is otherwise available. This can take the form of a\u00a0trusted adviser, but also software that integrates more thoughtfully into your daily life. I imagine that many investors would pay for value-added services, particularly for things like\u00a0life coaching bundled alongside financial advice.</li> <li>Performance: Pure alpha. Simple enough \u2014 there has always been a market for outstanding investment results and it is hard to imagine that changing. It will likely become more difficult for \u201ccloset indexers,\u201d who are in essence pretending to provide active management, to pass by undetected, but many professional investors will probably welcome that development.</li> <li>Permanence: Advice for the wealthy centered on specific issues relating to their legacy. This currently includes considerations like trust and estate planning, but I imagine that it will evolve to encompass a range of products that are not currently widely offered, like charitable plans that rival investment plans in sophistication, diversification, and analytic rigor.</li> </ul> <p>What have I left out? Do you see a vector where financial professionals can offer value above and beyond that provided by low or no-cost indexing services? Let me know in the comments section. After all,\u00a0\u201cfree checking\u201d has been around for a while,\u00a0and it would be difficult to argue that the retail banking industry has altogether gone away since then.</p>","tags":["wealth management","investment industry"]},{"location":"blog/2018/08/27/which-fictional-character-would-make-the-best-portfolio-manager/","title":"Which Fictional Character Would Make The Best Portfolio Manager?","text":"<p>To me, the answer is obviously\u00a0Bugs Bunny.\u00a0</p> <p>I have never once seen that rabbit lose his cool, no matter the situation.

His criticism was met with criticism, and his review has since been significantly edited. The paper\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0to accompany the revisions.\u00a0</p> <p>Why the\u00a0Sturm und Drang? A few of the sentences were a less than perfect treatment of the play's queer themes. Which are many. And Mr. Brantley does not appear to be a fan of camp in the first place. To my reading, most of the now-missing sentences objected to the play's many puns about transgender and non-binary identity as somewhat heavy handed. To me and many others \u00a0with transgender/queer identities, this is both fine and good fun.\u00a0</p> <p>A long way of saying: Brantley's critique has a strain of \"kids get off my lawn\" to my ear. Anyway, My Mom and I went last night because it sounded very awesome to us.\u00a0</p> <p>Here's the description:</p> <p>HEAD OVER HEELS is the bold new musical comedy from the visionaries that rocked Broadway with Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Avenue Q and Spring Awakening. This laugh-out-loud love story is set to the music of the iconic 1980's all-female rock band The Go-Go's, including the hit songs, \u201cWe Got the Beat,\u201d \u201cOur Lips Are Sealed,\u201d \u201cVacation,\u201d Belinda Carlisle's \u201cHeaven is a Place on Earth\u201d and \u201cMad About You.\u201d</p> <p>I mean, come on.\u00a0</p> <p>My\u00a0mom \u2014 who had her hip replaced six months ago \u2014 and I were dancing in the aisles. But it's not for everyone. She put it well: \"It's the gayest show I've ever seen on broadway.\" This is quite a statement. When she's feeling well, mom will see six shows in a week. That's a decent sample, and allows for a simple theory about the controversy: maybe it's a little too gay for Broadway, at least as policed by Mr. Brantley.\u00a0</p> <p>To me and perhaps to others, this is a fundamental achievement. Almost like discovering a new element of the periodic table. The play's time on Broadway may have all the stability of unobtanium, or whatever else our best and brightest have cooked up in laboratory conditions, but it will have a certain gravity to many of us. Not least because Peppermint's broadway debut is the first time a trans woman has originated a role on Broadway.</p> <p>So you should go while it's still up.

Too much is still the same today. Morehouse College's Fredrick Knight points out that black voter suppression -- sadly \"a southern tradition\" -- still flourishes. With regard to this particular election, he recently wrote that \"from Georgia\u2019s voter registration scandal to gerrymandered districts that dilute minority voting power, millions may be shut out of November\u2019s midterms.\"</p> <p>Georgia has long been a national laboratory for disenfranchisement.

A recent ruling concluded that the state's election officials - led by Republican candidate Brian Kemp - have \"buried their heads in the sand\" with respect to these crucial risks.\u00a0</p> <p>And it seems, to the basic needs of a free and fair election.\u00a0</p> <p>For a glimpse of the way things are on the ground, consider this New York Times headline: Georgia Voting Begins Amid Accusations of Voter Suppression.\u00a0Here's the lede:</p> <p>MARIETTA, Ga. \u2014 Wim Laven arrived to his polling location in Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs this week unsure what to make of recent allegations of voter difficulties at the ballot box.

We\u2019d only just gotten to know each other properly, and when you lose a mother you can really talk to, the practical upshot is that you have secrets again.\u00a0</p> <p>No-one can hear you in quite the same way, remembering and reminding as mothers do.

I expect to beat the average, but the statistic has a way of looming in the background.\u00a0</p> <p>She heard me scared, thought, and set herself to learning about what I could expect in my life. She sent me articles and took me to shows: Torch Song, Kinky Boots, Angels in America. We saw the first trans actress originate a role on Broadway.\u00a0</p> <p>And in September she bought me a book: To Survive on this Shore.\u00a0</p> <p>There's an older trans woman on the cover standing in the middle of a Chicago winter looking warm. And that's the point of the book: pictures of trans elders and their stories. On the inside cover, she wrote \u201cthis is to remind you that there is life after thirty for you. I am madly in love with you. MOM.\u201d</p> <p>Same.\u00a0</p> <p>I know she had regrets because I found a list of them. She hadn't taken full advantage of Harvard, or structured her time dancing in NYC as she would have wished. Once, a student in a ballet class of hers offered to introduce her to someone who could have changed her life. Saying no sometimes still moved her to tears.\u00a0</p> <p>Fourth and finally are the years she spent \u201cin a bottle\u201d, which meant slept-in Sundays and delegated diaper changes. The list ended \u201cof greatest sorrow is the years and years I lost of the lives of my precious children.\u201d</p> <p>We could never lose her all the way. She was always a standout, beautifully different in that she pumped her own gas, which is not a metaphor.\u00a0</p> <p>One of her fondest memories from her time upstate - my childhood - was speeding into our small town gas station in her little red jeep with a temporary tattoo of a tiger on her arm. She hopped out and pumped her own gas. The attendant was shocked: women just did not do that.\u00a0</p> <p>Clarissa Bushman did.\u00a0</p> <p>Sticking out was just her thing: she was a singing, dancing economist. Intuitive with bond math and Balanchine, she said early and often that her innate strangeness was a strength. And that\u2019s fortunate, because she only weirdened with time.\u00a0</p> <p>One specific instruction stands out: whenever the coughing fits which came standard with her laryngectomy set in, we were not to acknowledge them. Eventually we barely noticed: they were medically harmless. But it sure looked and sounded like she was choking.\u00a0</p> <p>So, imagine the family out to dinner. We'd take seats and eat in the same semi-respectable way we do everything. Then it would start, and we'd hardly move an eyebrow. Her hacks and hems were an order of magnitude louder than the stage whisper she spoke in, and could go on for two or three minutes.\u00a0</p> <p>The purest proof that she was magic was that this became fun. And mom, if you\u2019re really right there behind the back row, I hope you finally know. I love you madly, and always will.\u00a0</p> <p>Thank you all so much for coming.

Wait long enough, and you literally get to see flowers blooming in stuff that would have been sent to a landfill.</p> <p>And through the process of caring for your pile, you get up close and personal with the microorganisms that make our planet habitable. They turn cardboard, carrot shavings, avocado skins, and whatever else you throw at them into a cornucopia of life.</p> <p>The human's job in all of this is simple: give them the time, space, and air they need.</p> <p>I think it's analogous to what I do here in a few ways. First and foremost, I'm responsible for the pile of assets clients have entrusted to me. I stir it up when it needs air, do my best to keep pests out, and pay attention to everything that happens inside of it. Because it\u2019s my job to make sure it\u2019ll be there in the best possible form when my clients need it.</p> <p>But the similarities don\u2019t stop there. Here are a few more investment lessons from the compost pile:</p> <ol> <li> <p>It's a privilege. The physical space that's required for a good compost setup is hard to attain for most people. As a lifelong New Yorker, perhaps I appreciate this better than most. I wasn't able to start until after my 32nd birthday because I had no outdoor space to call my own. Similarly, the raw materials required to build an investment portfolio are out of most people's reach because the key resource is money. And most people don't have a lot of it. That's why I designed this firm so that we could work with people who share my values regardless of how much they have available to invest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Time is in charge. There's no sense in trying to rush compost. I'm sure someone would be happy to sell you a high-end machine that speeds things along, but that isn't needed or necessary if you approach your pile with patience. The same thing is true with investing. There are all sorts of trading strategies that people use to try and accelerate things, but the result often unnatural, costly, and worse than the returns that accrue to patient investors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balance is everything. Most compost piles feature a roughly three pounds of \"browns\" like shredded cardboard or dead leaves for every pound of \"greens\" like table scraps and plant cuttings. The balance ensures that the microorganisms in the pile have the correct amounts of carbon for energy and nitrogen for protein production. Similarly, portfolios should balance out investments in higher-risk innovative companies with allocations to more established enterprises and sustainable real estate to ensure we have enough stability to weather whatever may happen in the market.</p> </li> <li> <p>Diligence matters. Anything that makes it into your compost pile may eventually wind up in your food. So it's important to make sure that the plastic wrappers, cigarette butts, and other miscellaneous waste that often materializes outdoors (at least here in Brooklyn) get dealt with safely. I run all of the soil through a variety of screens to make sure nothing bad makes it into my garden, and I do the same thing with the companies in our portfolio to ensure they reflect the values of our clients and their communities in addition to solid risk-adjusted return opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nothing is wasted. Even just having a compost pile changes the way a garden works. Plants that don't make it get reconstituted into the rich, black earth that feeds the next generation. It's the same way with investing, where we're able to learn something from every opportunity we analyze, even if we only wind up investing in a handful of them.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I hope that's been an enjoyable exploration of some commonalities between tending a garden and taking care of an investment portfolio! If this has piqued your curiosity, you might be interested to learn more about our strategies.</p> <p>If you're interested in learning more about composting, here are a few great places to start:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Rodale Institute has conducted pioneering research into organic agriculture</p> </li> <li> <p>r/composting is an active community of fellow composters</p> </li> <li> <p>The Cornell Waste Management Institute has great resources on composting from a variety of perspectives</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["compost","investing","process"]},{"location":"blog/2022/01/03/evaluating-our-investment-performance/","title":"Evaluating our Investment Performance","text":"<p>It is not straightforward to measure the performance of an investment strategy like ours.</p> <p>That's because:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Our ethical criteria eliminates more than half of the companies that comprise popular indexes like the S&amp;P 500 from consideration,</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cSustainable\u201d indices tend to concentrate their holdings in technology companies like Facebook, Tesla, and Google we also exclude on moral grounds, and</p> </li> <li> <p>We invest globally, which makes it difficult to compare our results with stock markets in any particular country.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I could do a lot of complicated calculations to produce a more appropriate benchmark, but I don\u2019t feel that would help you understand what\u2019s happening in the portfolio any better.

It is a mission-driven lender chartered by Congress to create a secondary market for agricultural credit and one of the most important actors in America\u2019s farm credit system.\u00a0</p> <p>In a sense, this business is straightforward. Farmer Mac buys agricultural loans from regional banks, passing on the benefit of their federal government guarantees to rural America through cheaper and more widely available credit. The company estimates that farmers and ranchers invest $2 locally for every $1 they save on interest expenses, meaning that this benefit reaches deep into pockets of American society that are just plain difficult to access.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>The impact of Farmer Mac\u2019s partnerships with regional banks is also profound. These relationships allow the banks to retain generational relationships even as the value of farmland appreciates beyond their loan limits (which it often does), and stay ahead of less community-minded competitors.</p> <p>The underlying business dynamics are nothing short of beautiful. Like most banks, the company's main profit engine is the \u201cspread\u201d between its cost of borrowing and the interest it receives from borrowers. And Farmer Mac is able to borrow remarkably inexpensively thanks to its status as a Government Sponsored Enterprise.\u00a0</p> <p>It gets better, because the company makes good loans safely. Cumulative losses in its farm and ranch segment, which represents a little less than half of its balance sheet, have been .12%. That\u2019s a little more than a tenth of 1%! The other three segments have never reported a credit loss, and the company carries roughly five times as much capital as risk-based measures indicate is required thanks to tight regulations.\u00a0</p> <p>The outlook for financial growth is strong. Farmer Mac holds just a 5.7% share of the overall US agricultural mortgage market, and has grown its overall business volume at a compounded 10.3% per annum over the twenty years from 2000 to 2020. 99% of this business volume is recurring net effective spread and fees, which makes it reasonable to assume that this growth (and the company\u2019s 16% return on equity) will be durable.\u00a0</p> <p>What excites me most, though, is the opportunity for impact that owning these shares affords us. Farmer Mac is uniquely positioned to shape the US agricultural market, support the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, and ensure that our coming adaptation to the realities of climate change does not needlessly displace farming communities. And though our shares are officially non-voting, our ownership stake gives us a seat at the table to advocate for policies that will reduce harm to animals throughout the agricultural system while supporting sustained economic prosperity.</p>","tags":["global-opportunities"]},{"location":"blog/2022/02/09/dont-stop-with-divestment/","title":"Don't Stop With Divestment","text":"<p>Fossil duel divestment is all the rage these days, with bellwethers like the Harvard University endowment joining a decades-long movement to banish hydrocarbons from their investment programs.</p> <p>According to the Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Commitments Database, they join 1500 other institutions representing a total of $39.88 trillion that have taken such steps.

The picture above is me playing with her briefcase shortly after I learned to walk.</p> <p>My dad is also one of the most insightful analysts I've ever met. While I was cutting my teeth at Oppenheimer in 2007, he was warning everyone who would listen about leverage in the financial system and pushing the investment community to re-evaluate companies like General Electric that had become addicted to financial engineering. I still watch his first tv appearance about it every once in a while as a reminder of how deeply the markets can misunderstand a company.</p> <p>Even with these fantastic firsthand experiences, I struggled to understand why individual investors should invest their money in anything but index funds.</p> <p>This chart, which shows the total return of both General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 since dad first went on TV to talk about it, gives a good sense of why.</p>   ![](images/koyfin_20240523_054134722-1024x529.png)    Returns for General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 Index since August 15th, 2009   <p>An investor who decided to bet against GE after dad's interview aired would have had to incur significant cost, manage mechanical complexities, and wait close to a decade for the insight to deliver any benefit to them.</p> <p>And in the meantime, a simple index fund investor would have compounded their capital faster and had more time to think about other things.</p> <p>That's what I call a win-win.</p> <p>My confidence in this simple and straightforward approach only grew as I gained more information.</p> <p>Joining CFA Institute in 2010 gave me an opportunity to dive deep into state of the art academic research that surrounds the practice of investment management in a context where my sole responsibility was to highlight tools, tactics, and technologies that investment professionals make better decisions on behalf of their clients.</p> <p>I started out writing educational materials, but quickly got sucked into the organization's online community-building efforts. I was put in charge of recruiting expert voices for what eventually became the Enterprising Investor (still the #1 investing blog in the world according to Feedly) and jumped in with both feet.</p> <p>The task was to connect with the most thoughtful investors I could find and convince them to put their thoughts into writing on our platform. That led to some profoundly interesting work. Notable explorations of the difference between investing and speculation, what poker teaches us about risk, and the lessons from a famous bet with Warren Buffett are just the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>Eventually I got to add my own voice into the mix in addition to curating expert views. I wrote about what Enron can teach financial analysts, the role that faith plays in investment processes, and whether ESG and sustainability could enhance investor returns.</p> <p>We did a lot of stuff I'm proud of. I even wrote a book with my friend and mentor Jason Voss about how to come up with original investment ideas.</p> <p>I still couldn't see why individual investors would invest in anything but an index fund.</p> <p>And then I came out.</p> <p>It was 2017. I had been experiencing gender dysphoria for my whole life. And I finally felt able to do something about it besides distracting myself. I changed my name, my appearance, and my pronouns with the benefit of a supportive work environment, then prepared myself for whatever might happen when the rest of the world noticed.</p>   ![](images/CleanShot-2024-05-23-at-17.43.07-717x1024.png)    _Yours truly in Institutional Investor back when it was still a paper magazine.

I started a podcast with my friend Ashby Monk to explore how the world's most sophisticated investors were working to build a better future for finance, and began writing the \"Inclusion in Wealth\" column for Citywire RIA to explore issues around diversity, equity, and belonging in our industry.</p> <p>But I still wasn't an active manager.</p> <p>Until my girlfriend and I sat down to have the conversation about how we would invest our money, I would have said it was interesting but not particularly applicable. And yes, I would have offered a full-throated defense of index funds and passive management.</p> <p>But when we actually enumerated our values, it turned out that I held some pretty extreme views.</p> <p>Specifically:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Companies should pay their taxes,</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid preventable harm to living things, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Care for the communities where they operate.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Though I've expressed them fairly concisely above, those values actually summarize a two page, single spaced policy that excludes companies with questionable products, conduct, or both from our investment strategies.</p> <p>But however well-constructed our policy is, it's unlikely to produce compelling results unless it's part of a coherent investment process.</p> <p>There's a simple reason for that: our screening process isn't good enough.</p> <p>It can't be.</p> <p>The capital markets are literally a manifestation of the world's current power structure. Anything that people do will find a way to concretize in them somewhere. So eventually I realized there is no checklist comprehensive enough to rely upon.</p> <p>You have to pay attention.</p> <p>Because companies often talk a big game, but are absent when it comes time to come through for their communities. Because our goal is not just to identify companies that are shaping the world positively but also to generate financial stability for our clients. So I can't just buy the stuff that makes it through the screens and pretend I'm making the world a better place.</p> <p>That's not to say that index funds are bad. Far from it! I have Jack Bogle's autograph sitting above my desk, and I still think that they do an excellent job growing people's money without requiring much in the way of oversight or critical thought.</p> <p>They just have nothing to do with ethics.</p> <p>And as an ethics-first investor, I owe it to everyone evaluating my strategy to be clear that there is substantial independent judgement and discretion involved in what we do.</p> <p>We do not \"set and forget\" anything. My purpose in starting this firm is to support a restless search for better, more complete, and more reliable investment options than currently exist.

The availability of potash, phosphate, and fossil fuel derived agricultural inputs that we rely upon to feed earth's growing populations has already been materially reduced, and these stresses could take as long as 3-5 years to resolve.</p> <p>The timeline comes from to Peter Zeihan, an analyst I've been following for close to a decade for his sharp views on geopolitics, energy, and international trade. His YouTube channel is free, and has been illuminating during Russia's recent war of aggression, so I took the opportunity to dig a little deeper into how his views intersect with something that should be of interest to everyone on the planet: our food system.</p> <p>He would probably want me to underscore one point at the outset of this exploration: modern agriculture is an industrial process. It's true that regenerative approaches are growing in popularity, but at the moment only about 5.5 million of the United States' roughly 900 million acres of farmland is certified organic. That's well under one percent.</p> <p>So as a practical matter, synthetic fertilizers are currently supporting about half of the world's population.</p> <p></p> <p>The chart above is stark enough before we pause to consider that supply chain disruptions (and the most acute threats to food security) are not evenly distributed around the world.</p> <p>North America is unique in that we have plentiful sources of potash, phosphate, and natural gas in close proximity to our midwestern \"breadbasket.\" Only a few other places in the world are so fortunate:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Eighty percent of global potash production comes from Canada, China, Belarus, or Russia.</p> </li> <li> <p>China, Morocco, and the United States produce two thirds of the world's phosphate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Russia and the United States are the world's two largest producers of natural gas.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You may have noticed that Russia featured twice in that list. Both Mr. Putin's Petrostate and allied Belarus are now subject to sanctions, which effectively takes a non-trivial portion of the market offline.</p> <p>It's too soon to tell what this will mean exactly, but just a few days ago the Interim Chief Executive of Nutrien, the world's biggest fertilizer producer, said \"We are going to run our plants. Run them flat out. Could we see interruptions in exports out of Russia? Yes. Can we see plant closures? We could.\"</p> <p>Such a disruption would be poorly timed, since the northern hemisphere's temperate agricultural regions will be in the full bloom of spring before too long. And fertilizer only works if you put it on the plants before they grow.

They need to be extracted, transported, refined, and then transported again to reach their final destinations.</p> <p>Upon arrival, they also have an unfortunate tendency to leach into groundwater and literally strangle waterways with out-of-control algal blooms. But even if those negative effects could be contained, farmers would still need to keep spending substantial sums re-applying these treatments every year. And their soil wouldn't be any better off after all of the expense and complexity involved.</p> <p>Farmers will do their best to adapt. Some might stop planting corn in favor of soy, which needs less fertilizer to grow than conventional cultivation methods. They might even take steps towards adopting regenerative practices by using manure in place of expensive fertilizers.</p> <p>But that won't help the folks in the global south who are already facing food insecurity.</p> <p></p> <p>It's hard to pinpoint where on the planet these pressures will manifest, but one can safely and sadly assume that the darkest-tinted countries in the map above are set to carry most of the weight.</p> <p>This is a policy choice. And delaying our adaptation leaves many vulnerable populations around the world needlessly exposed to famine.</p> <p>Even if we were to forget how to make synthetic fertilizer, we could still adapt our agricultural system to feed everybody on earth and entirely mitigate the risk of famine by phasing out animal agriculture. This would free up 75-400% of the land currently in agricultural use (depending on the way you measure), substantially reduce humanity's carbon footprint, and prevent billions of living, thinking creatures from experiencing needless suffering.</p> <p>It would also create a much more resilient economy, since we wouldn't have to worry about geopolitical tensions spilling over into famine with the same sort of urgency.

And with each passing month, I became more and more concerned that these operations were introducing errors into our reported results.</p> <p>This isn't so relevant for our existing clients. They have always had access to accurate, up-to-date performance information calculated by Altruist, our custodian.</p> <p>But it's important to me (and our regulators) that prospective clients have access to accurate, timely information about our investment strategies. So as of today, I'm making a material change to the way we measure and present our investment performance.</p> <p>Please note that this change is only applicable to the performance we show publicly for each of our strategies. If you're a client, the most accurate performance information will always be available to you directly through the Altruist web portal or app.</p> <p>What's changing?</p> <p>Each of our strategy pages now shows the performance for an actual fee-paying account that has been invested in that strategy since its inception instead of a calculated value.</p> <p>Why are you making this change now?</p> <p>Our recent hire has allowed me to spend additional time auditing our internal processes.

Attentive readers will remember that I used to work at that organization, and can probably imagine that I continue to hold its standards in high regard.</p> <p>If I see an opportunity for us to move towards compliance with these standards without compromising our ability to accept clients with no investment minimum, I will seize it.

If you'd like to access that full discussion just click the image below. But give it a gander in any case, because I want to tell you a few things about it.</p> <p></p> <p>At a high level, the premise of this chart is that the vague idea of \"aligning with a more sustainable future\" can be broken up into four parts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Managing externalities. This is the most basic reason that ESG (and the associated data) are important. Having access to information about the composition of a company's workforce, the carbon intensity of its operations, and the long-term planning processes it uses to prepare for a range of possible futures helps us know that their operations are not creating negative consequences for surrounding communities. Crucially, this can also help us gain confidence that the company is insulated from negative surprises, which goes a long way towards mitigating risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aligning with growth trends. Any version of \"building a better world\" includes building new tools, technologies, and infrastructure. And whether we're talking about safe housing for seniors, scaling renewable energy generation, or building better software for teachers, paying careful attention to what the world needs is a big help when designing investment portfolios. As analysts, we're able to work backwards from what's needed, identify large growth opportunities, and then ensure we own companies that are well-placed to meet those needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoiding stranded assets. As climate change unfolds and humanity reacts to it, substantial disruptions in financial markets are all but certain to emerge. These will never be entirely avoidable, but they are somewhat forseeable. Take the case of fossil fuels, which will hopefully be substantially less widely used sometime in the next couple of decades. The financial think tank Carbon Tracker estimates that $1 trillion of oil and gas assets are at serious risk of becoming worthless as a result.</p> </li> <li> <p>Driving real-world impact. This is what most people think of when \"sustainable investing\" comes up. It's difficult to deliver and even more difficult to quantify, which has left many people with false understandings of what's possible. With that said, all of the strategies we manage seek to avoid preventable harm to living things while also contributing to positive real-world outcomes. With that said, we do our best to learn from the industry's past mistakes when discussing this with our clients, and will always seek to underpromise and over-deliver.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each of these four components of \"building a better world\" is worth thinking about in isolation, but as a practical matter it's worth remembering that we pursue them is all at once. There is a substantial difference between driving positive change in the real world and protecting your hard-earned dollars, but we pursue them all at the same time as part of an integrated process.</p>","tags":["esg","investing","ratings"]},{"location":"blog/2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#reasonable-expectations-the-key-to-satisfaction","title":"Reasonable Expectations: The Key to Satisfaction","text":"<p>We focus on making sure that our clients have reasonable expectations about what to expect from the funds they entrust to us.

The solar power industry as a whole was a poor performer in 2023 thanks to changes in California's net metering laws that substantially reduced the industry's sales momentum. But we believe great businesses are built in downturns like these, and as long-term investors we have complete confidence in the management team led by the indefatigable Badri Kothandraraman.</p> </li> <li> <p>Crocs (CROX) was the second-largest detractor from performance after momentum slowed at Heydude, a footwear brand it acquired in early 2022. This has produced a degree of financial indigestion as markets struggled to make sense of what to expect from the newly combined entity. We reduced our position during the year and cannot profess blind faith in the management team. With that said, we believe shares offer compelling value at the moment, with a ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of roughly 15%.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) was the third-largest detractor from performance as the slowing commercial real estate market affected valuations of all companies included in commercial real estate indices. But Alexandria's hyper-specialized business of providing lab space to innovative biotechnology companies can hardly be thought of as similar to mainstream commercial office buildings.

Much of the reasoning we shared back in January 2022 remains unchanged, and we have grown the position since that post to almost 15% of our ethical growth strategy. As a portfolio manager, one of my largest fears is that the market will come to recognize the value of this unique company before I can buy even more of it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Duolingo (DUOL) The market afforded us the opportunity to buy into this remarkably impactful firm at a discount to its IPO price, and we did so in size. In the ensuing months, an old-school bubble in everything and anything vaguely linked to AI took hold, and the price appreciated significantly. We're no longer holding quite as many shares of this firm. But we challenge anyone to watch CEO Luis Von Ahn's 2011 TED talk on the thesis for Duolingo and walk away anything but inspired and excited. Today, shares are only about 70% above their summer 2021 IPO price, and the company continues to grow revenues at a remarkably stable 40% a year.</p> </li> <li> <p>TopBuild (BLD) I can't help but smile every time I think of this position, which we've held since the strategy's inception. In 2022, market prognosticators were calling for a recession, which cut the price of this insulation distributor down to half the current level because sales of insulation products are broadly seen as tied to the housing cycle. But the compelling operational footprint that this company has carefully assembled over decades combined with the real-world cost savings that good insulation offers building owners to create a wonderful financial equation as they thoughtfully consolidate their industry over the coming decades.</p> </li> <li> <p>E.L.F. Beauty (ELF) This company needs no introduction for any makeup users reading this piece. They produce cruelty-free competitors to costly beauty staples at a remarkable clip, and are experiencing accelerating revenue growth as they penetrate deeper into traditional sales channels while retaining an ironclad hold on gen-z and cost-conscious consumers. The only reason it's not a larger position in our portfolios is that our process requires us to be mindful of valuation, and the company is regularly in the most expensive decile across a range of metrics. With that said, we're likely to be shareholders for many years to come.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quanta Services (PWR) This company has a commanding position in infrastructure services, which includes renewable energy, communications, pipeline maintenance, and almost everything related to the electrical grid. Their approach to safety has long captivated me, and the company has been a prime beneficiary of the federal government's infrastructure spending. With a sales backlog that may be larger than their $30 billion market capitalization by now, this company is profoundly well prepared for whatever future may come.</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["global-opportunities"]},{"location":"blog/2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#comparison-with-our-index","title":"Comparison with our Index","text":"<p>On the face of things, we substantially outperformed our index last year.</p> <p>That's relatively simple to establish: The Ethical Growth strategy's 33.51% return was larger than the MSCI ACWI's 22.27% return.</p> <p>But it's also not the most complete analysis, since many of the largest contributors to the index's returns are excluded from all of our strategies for ethical reasons.

But your student stakeholders are calling out for clearer moral lines about what their endowment stands to profit from.</p> <p>I don't have to tell you that we've been down this road before. With fossil fuels and for-profit prisons, tobacco companies, and plenty more. And this time around, I am urging you: take the students seriously, not just literally.</p> <p>The operational challenges of managing a modern endowment portfolio necessitate long-term planning. You've got to pace the maturation of your holdings to coincide with spending plans, produce a steady stream of consistent quality opportunities to match with incoming cash, and manage the complex communications associated with your own oversight.</p> <p>I suggest you situate this entire discussion within that oversight process. The most effective way to take the students seriously is to build a moral oversight process and reporting framework that passes their muster. With such a thing in place, you will be able to make genuine long-term commitments without worrying about subsequent challenges from stakeholders.</p> <p>There isn't one right way to build something like that: you will need to build and refine your own approach.</p> <p>But we've learned a few things over the past few years that might be helpful to other long-term investors thinking about how to merge a little more morality into the way they do money management.</p> <p>Here are a few suggestions that may be helpful.</p> <p>Embrace the Challenge</p> <p>Even if they've been operating under an ESG policy for years, deeply integrating ethical criteria into investment decision making will be new for most investment offices.</p> <p>So was crypto. But unlike the blockchain stuff, building competency here is all but guaranteed to pay dividends for your organization. Think about it: this will not be the last moral issue you have to contend with. As you prune and populate your portfolio, wouldn't it be nice to have a handle on things that may impede your ability to act as a true long-term investor?</p> <p>If you are thoughtful, earnest, and perhaps lucky, you will find a way to engage with your stakeholders that becomes a source of positive idiosyncrasy. That's a big part of what makes this firm special: our clients know that I want to hear about their moral concerns ASAP. As a result, we've got our ear to the ground in ways that would be difficult to replicate for folks who are just feigning interest.</p> <p>Make a Living List</p> <p>You will want a living document that describes the conduct and products that your stakeholders consider to be objectionable.</p> <p>To make this easier, we have made our own policy available under a Creative Commons license that allows others to build upon it however they'd like. Our own policy has never felt like my property, as it has been iteratively refined in collaboration with our clients and was built upon the work that organizations like NBIM had done before us.</p> <p>Our approach is unusual in that it allows me to overrule any of the individual criteria if I see an opportunity for constructive dialogue with the company or another means for the shareholding to manifest positive impact. This gives me substantial flexibility to use the tools at my disposal to drive impact, and avoids making ethical oversight into a box-ticking exercise.</p> <p>You Won't Miss the Stuff You Exclude</p> <p>I've overseen our process for almost three years at this point, and I'm still surprised how little I miss the companies that we've excluded for ethical reasons.</p> <p>There are almost 3,000 issuers on our exclusion list for all manner of conduct and product-related sins. Of those companies, there are only a handful that I would consider sensible investments. The majority are on there for more than one reason. And when we update our exclusions to include new criteria, we often find new and exciting reasons not to miss them.</p> <p>I believe there is an existential link between governance, ethics, and investability. And if you manage to identify that companies have endemic ethics problems, why wouldn't you remove them from your investable universe?</p> <p>Aquiesce to Active</p> <p>Ethical investing is active investment management. It is foolish to pretend otherwise.</p> <p>You can spend a lot of time and effort worrying about how to mean-variance optimize your holdings so that their volatility patterns match those of a broader index, but you'll miss a profound opportunity to recontextualize your investment program in the process. Your required rate of return is likely your ultimate benchmark, so why not use it instead of legacy indices?</p> <p>After all, if you embark on an honest and searching divestment journey, it's likely that your holdings will look a lot different than the S&amp;P 500. And it will be a journey. I wrote an essay reflecting on my own path a few years ago that may be useful.</p> <p>Harness The Energy of your Stakeholders</p> <p>I can't remember a time when young people were this interested in what's happening inside of their University's endowments. If I were working in one of these offices, I would be looking for ways to listen to these folks on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>Why not survey students on a wide range of ethical issues to see where they stand? Or work to identify types of investments that would appeal to these stakeholders?</p> <p>It can't be that hard to hire a facilitator to tease out the things that would be seen as exciting or equitable, and that idea generation work may lead to tangible opportunities.</p> <p>Ask for Help</p> <p>I probably only have the bandwidth to engage in-depth with one investment office on this outside of facilitating access to our flagship strategy. But there are plenty of others out there who could be helpful, and I happen to be friendly with a lot of them.</p> <p>Send us a note if you'd like us to provide some ideas confidentially. But this suggestion goes far beyond anything I, my firm, or our community can do for you.</p> <p>After all, the broad debate about divestment can get heated. But you've risen to the height of our profession, and likely have wise people whose counsel you rely on. As I said above, you'll need to evolve your own response to these student demands.

We are going to continue to emit a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and, as the economist and blogger Tyler Cowen is reputed to have said, \"Mostly we're going to see how hot it gets.\"</p> <p>I have tremendous respect for Larry. His work as Director of Research at the CFA Institute Research Foundation was a big part of my life in the nine years I spent on staff at CFA Institute. But the dichotomy between sustainability and prosperity that he presents is false. And his logic is not just flawed, but also seductive and therefore dangerous.\u00a0</p> <p>With that said, it wouldn't be particularly useful of me to simply say that I disagree. The investment community is rife with differences of opinion: they're literally required in order for the market to function. So I see it as my responsibility to not only wade into this discussion, but to voice my dissent constructively.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>The architecture of Larry's argument is fairly straightforward:\u00a0</p> <ol> <li> <p>Access to energy is a necessary precondition for economic growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Energy demand will increase as countries in the global south grow their economies.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Meeting all this demand with current renewable energy technologies is not plausible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fossil fuels are therefore the only way to meet the demand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Preventing climate change is impossible given all the fossil fuels we must burn, so all we can do is adapt to it.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Much of this is undeniable, but also incomplete.\u00a0</p> <p>The climate has already changed in ways that may be irreversible, so it's impossible to disagree with Larry's conclusion that we ought to focus on adapting to climate change instead of preventing it.\u00a0</p> <p>But after thoughtful consideration of what adaptation might actually cost and involve, it's similarly impossible to conclude that blindly increasing our consumption of fossil fuels in a bid to boost growth is a sane path forward. The costs associated with Larry's plan would be profound, the growth he claims it would unlock may never materialize, and the ethics of putting such a plan forward are immensely problematic.\u00a0</p> <p>Over the following paragraphs, we'll take a deep look at what adapting to climate change actually means. Over the course of that exploration, it will become clear that the risks of acceding to this proposed future far outweigh the potential benefits.\u00a0</p>","tags":["economics","energy-transition","fossil-fuels","renewables"]},{"location":"blog/2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#we-cant-know-what-comes-next","title":"We Can't Know What Comes Next","text":"<p>I wish we could take it as a given that the global south will experience the economic growth it needs over the coming decade.\u00a0</p> <p>Unfortunately, a recent World Bank report makes this impossible. The authors examined the seventy-five countries eligible for loans and grants from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), which are the poorest countries in the world by definition, and found some disquieting results.</p> <p>The headline is stark: more than half of these countries are growing more slowly than the rich world. And fully one third of them are poorer today than they were at the onset of the COVID pandemic. This is a significant change from the past: We have to look back to the late 1990s in order to find a period where broadly increasing prosperity was this unusual.\u00a0</p> <p>I can't tell you exactly why this is, but here's one contributing factor: over the course of the last thirty years, jobs have reliably been created in lower cost economies as supply chains globalized in search of the most capital-efficient means of production. But after the frailties of this system were laid bare by the global pandemic, global companies began to \"nearshore\" or \"friendshore\" their operations in order to mitigate exposure to future shocks.\u00a0</p> <p>Firm-level benefits aside, further fragmentation of the previous world order is likely to have chilling effects on global economic growth.\u00a0</p> <p>A recent IMF working paper estimates a long-term global GDP loss of 4.5 percent if global economic integration reverts to its level in the year 2000, which was before China joined the World Trade Organization. Almost everyone would be worse off in this scenario, especially if tariffs and other barriers to trade were to be enacted as \"corrective\" measures.\u00a0</p> <p>And regrettably, some degree of such action is likely in the near future. To be clear: I am not predicting this. And I am certainly not rooting for it.\u00a0</p> <p>But the reality is simple: broader, more inclusive global growth is not a foregone conclusion under any circumstances. Trends in global trade patterns that made it seem that way may be reverting just as costly challenges are materializing.</p> <p>Climate change is one of the most significant such challenges. Natural disasters already cost the average IDA country 1.3% of its GDP per year, and that has roughly doubled in recent decades. And though it's difficult to know exactly what will happen as the climate changes, the consensus view is that these disasters will intensify.\u00a0</p>","tags":["economics","energy-transition","fossil-fuels","renewables"]},{"location":"blog/2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#lets-see-how-hot-it-gets","title":"Let's See How Hot it Gets","text":"<p>Here in the intermountain west, it's already obvious that a little bit of warming goes a long way. There is more than 300 million tons of dead wood in Colorado's forests that's rapidly drying into tinder for future wildfires.\u00a0</p> <p>This isn't just nightmare fuel. It's also the state's fastest growing forest carbon pool.</p> <p>New, healthy trees don't automatically grow back in their place because the ecological niches these species have evolved to inhabit no longer exist.\u00a0</p> <p>This is far from an aesthetic consideration: these trees have historically provided a far-reaching suite of services to the surrounding ecosystems. And even if we had the data and audacity to claim that we fully understand these support structures, we won't be able to replicate them without colossal, costly effort.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>This single spillover effect from climate change has already turned the skies in New York City orange, caused more than half of the most dangerous air pollution in the American West, and left our ecosystems vulnerable to invasive species. </p> <p>And this is ground truth, not a projection.\u00a0</p> <p>If we move towards the future on the path Larry proposes, we have no ready means of knowing what we will unleash.</p> <p>The climate scientist slang for a future of fossil-fueled economic development is \"taking the highway,\" and the IPCC has a dedicated model to describe it. They refer to it as Shared Socioeconomic Pathway(SSP) 5-8.5.\u00a0</p> <p>It's really quite a fascinating model, but it can be difficult to draw functional conclusions from without a bit of help. Fortunately, a new web app from spatial ecologist Matthew Fitzpatrick at the University of Maryland can help us imagine the disruptions that lurk down that path.</p> <p>The app extends and updates a 2019 analysis published in Nature Communications to allow anyone to see how the climate is likely to change in 40,581 places and 5,323 cities around the world under SSP5-8.5.\u00a0</p> <p>Some of these allegories are dramatic: \"If you happen to live in New York City, you would need to travel to northern Mississippi to experience what New York is expected to feel like by 2080. Say hello to hot, really humid summers and goodbye to snow in winter.\"\u00a0</p> <p>But the profound danger of Larry's plan becomes even clearer when we take a tour through the largest equatorial cities. By 2080, the climate in Lagos, Kinshasa, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Riyadh, Accra, Dar Es Salaam, and Manila will have changed so starkly that there is nowhere on earth we can look to as an analogy. And that's not a complete list.\u00a0</p> <p>Taipei and Singapore will suffer the same fate, so in this future we can at least look forward to a tidy natural experiment that will demonstrate whether \u2014 and to what extent \u2014 wealth will work to shield us against an unearthly reality.\u00a0</p> <p>Not everything is bad and getting worse. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is back to record coral cover, for instance. And though that should cheer us, it's important to remember that these advances come after a $5 billion funding commitment from the government of Australia.\u00a0</p> <p>With that in mind, it's reasonable to wonder what other costs would mount as the planet warms further. And remember that proceeding upon a development path that ignores those costs creates liabilities that will encumber future economic growth when they come due.\u00a0</p> <p>On this subject, my central insight is not that hard to grasp: it's much simpler to avoid a mess than clean up after one. The interlinked ecological systems affected by the climate are profoundly complex and already struggling.\u00a0</p> <p>Investment professionals like me and Larry have a clear role to play in helping society navigate the implications of this, but we'll need to have a good, hard look at our professional ethics in order to do that effectively.\u00a0</p>","tags":["economics","energy-transition","fossil-fuels","renewables"]},{"location":"blog/2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#capital-gains-for-me-ruin-for-thee","title":"Capital Gains for Me, Ruin For Thee","text":"<p>My most profound misgiving about Larry's line of argumentation is that he will not experience anything close to the worst outcomes of climate change.\u00a0</p> <p>As a fellow American and member of the investor class, both he and I are not just geographically remote from the worst of these outcomes, but will likely be able to afford whatever tech-enabled tools arise to mitigate the reality he advocates for.</p> <p>Most folks in the global south would have no such succor, yet Larry would say he is writing out of concern for their prosperity. Underneath a chart that presents a clear linear relationship between energy use per capita and GDP per capita, he writes:\u00a0</p> <p>\"Economic growth is pushing almost every country... toward prosperity. Pushing them back... would be the cruelest joke ever played on what Frantz Fanon called \"the wretched of the Earth.\"</p> <p>I would hate to be involved in a cruel joke of any form, so let's embrace the premise that there's a straightforward path to sustained growth in any given country for a second. We'll restrict our analysis to a single country - the Democratic Republic of the Congo - to keep things fairly tangible.\u00a0</p> <p>Imagine that after adopting our fossil fuel led development agenda, Congolese GDP grows constantly at the fastest clip observed in any single year since 1960 \u2014 9.7% \u2014 for each of the fifty-five years between us and the year 2080. Assuming no change to population size, their GDP per capita would reach roughly the same level we enjoy today in the United States.\u00a0</p> <p>Would that be worth it?\u00a0</p> <p>From the narrow standpoint of global investors, maybe. Even just one growth story of that magnitude would unleash a bonanza for us capital markets types. And if we buy the premise that Larry's plan would unlock growth of a similar magnitude across the global south, it gets very easy to anticipate describing our net worths with an extra comma or two.\u00a0</p> <p>But at what cost, and to whom? </p> <p>After 5\u00b0C worth of global warming, any remaining Kinshasans would likely have to contend with fatal wet bulb temperatures throughout the rainy season. It's possible that the mining industry would find ways to keep employees safe enough to keep the flow of critical minerals going, but that might involve wearing something akin to a space suit whenever they go outside. The agricultural sector \u2014 which currently employs about three-fourths of the country's labor force \u2014 would be eviscerated.</p> <p>Are the people of the Congo asking for this? Do they have the strong democratic institutions that would be necessary to grant their informed consent? We can certainly find individuals who align with Larry's thinking, but that's a long way away from a popular consensus.\u00a0</p> <p>The moral argument Larry makes is particularly seductive to western ears. But I'd like to foreground something James Baldwin said in the 1970 documentary Meeting the Man: James Baldwin in Paris as we explore it.. </p> <p>Here's the quote:\u00a0</p> <p>You, the English, you, the French, you, the West, you, the Christians. You can't help but feel that there is something you can do for me. That you can save me. And you do not yet know that I have endured your salvation so long, I cannot afford it anymore.</p> <p>The upshot here is straightforward: whatever their motivations, western interventions aimed at promoting prosperity are not necessarily welcomed by the folks they seek to support.\u00a0</p> <p>Think about how much would need to go right for future Congolese people to celebrate this plan retrospectively.\u00a0</p> <p>Growth would have to come fast, then last.\u00a0</p> <p>And even more unlikely: we must assume that both the political will to do something about all of the resulting negative externalities and the technology to actually get that done would arise at some point.\u00a0</p>","tags":["economics","energy-transition","fossil-fuels","renewables"]},{"location":"blog/2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#why-are-they-excited-about-this-again","title":"Why Are They Excited About This Again?","text":"<p>I don't want to run the risk of mischaracterizing Larry or Mark Mills, the analyst he quotes extensively in his essay. So there's a big quote from them coming soon. But because their argument talks a lot about GDP growth, I'll first remind you that Simon Kuznets \u2014 the economist who came up with GDP \u2014 had the following to say about it:</p> <p>GDP 'measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.</p> <p>I hope having that handy makes the next few paragraphs a bit more fun for you:</p> <p>The proportion of the world's GDP spent on energy-in-the-large, including food and animal feed, has decreased by an order of magnitude since the early modern era. A society that spends upwards of 70 percent of its income on food and fodder is poor indeed...</p> <p></p> <p>But energy costs as a share of GDP didn't really fall off a cliff until the rapid industrialization of the nineteenth century, powered by coal and then oil and gas.\u00a0</p> <p>This may be counterintuitive: don't heavy industries use a lot of energy? Yes, but an industrial economy is so much more productive than an agricultural and handcraft economy that the denominator \u2013 world GDP \u2013 grew massively.\u00a0</p> <p>Thus, the energy share fell even as the absolute consumption of energy soared. Interestingly, the energy share of GDP has remained about the same \u2013 around 10 percent \u2013since the early 1900s.\u00a0</p> <p>This is not because energy use remained stable, but because energy use and economic output exploded upward roughly in tandem.</p> <p>It's interesting that Larry and Mark celebrate the role of technological development in producing this output explosion, but neglect to consider it in their analysis of renewable energy technologies. Their case that the energy needed to fuel growth must come from fossil fuels rests on the unstated assumption that renewables technology will not improve.</p> <p>This is ahistorical.\u00a0</p> <p>The cost of building new wind and solar facilities has declined by orders of magnitude over the past twenty years while their efficiency has grown by leaps and bounds. And new battery chemistries are emerging based on plentiful, inexpensive minerals like sodium which may further reshape the energy landscape over coming decades.\u00a0</p> <p>In other words, today's renewable energy technologies may not be able to fulfill global energy demand, but tomorrow's might. </p> <p>The 18th century economist Thomas Malthus used similar logic to argue that the supply of food could not keep pace with the growth of the human population. But new developments in agricultural technology intervened and our planet is now home to roughly eight times as many humans who enjoy a much higher standard of living than those ancestors.\u00a0</p> <p>So as we consider the argument that fossil fuels are the only source capable of meeting our energy needs, let's remember that things have a way of changing. The first patents for solar panels and wind turbines were only granted in the 1880s, and they've since evolved from novelties into economically viable alternatives.\u00a0</p> <p>This is particularly important because the path Larry and Mark propose has significant costs in addition to money. Average temperatures have already risen by .8\u00b0C relative to their average between 1961 and 1990, and it's worth underlining that the order-of-magnitude increases in quality of living as measured by the cost of food and fodder had already materialized by 1900.\u00a0</p> <p>We have cell phones and the internet now, but also PFAS, and \u2014 according to a great report from the Republican side of Congress' Joint Economic Committee \u2014 a level of mortality from deaths of despair like suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease that \"surpasses anything seen in America since the dawn of the 20th century.\"\u00a0</p> <p>There's one thing we never had back then: plastic. </p> <p>That's not particularly interesting at first glance. Production volume in almost everything has grown by leaps and bounds in the postwar period. But there is one particularly pertinent thing to remember about plastics: they're made of oil.\u00a0</p> <p>And demand for them is a huge part of global oil demand. To wit: the International Energy Agency's latest medium-term oil outlook notes that Chinese imports of plastic polymers, synthetic fibers like polyester, and other intermediate petrochemicals produced roughly as much oil demand as the entire country of Germany in 2023.\u00a0</p> <p>The authors expect rising demand for petrochemicals (which, to be fair, is a much broader category than just plastics) to drive roughly three quarters of the increase in global oil demand between now and 2030.\u00a0</p> <p>And that's worth remembering as you read the first sentence of Larry's concluding section, which notes:\u00a0</p> <p>Some would say that it's worth sacrificing almost everything we value in life to \"save the planet.\"</p> <p>When the discussion is framed that way, it's easy to overlook the many tangible steps that can be taken to mitigate the negative effects of fossil fuel consumption.\u00a0</p> <p>I doubt anyone would sign up to live in an unrecognizable world in order to preserve some semblance of normalcy. But that's exactly the world that will result from Larry's proposed path forward: just think about all of the cities with an unearthly future that we've talked about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>By contrast, a future with less plentiful polymers is a lot easier to stomach. Wouldn't you be willing to give up plastic bottles and polyester for a chance at a more sustainable future? Wading into trade-offs like this is at the heart of effective adaptation to climate change, which Larry and I agree is absolutely essential.\u00a0</p> <p>So what does it look like to take that challenge seriously?</p>","tags":["economics","energy-transition","fossil-fuels","renewables"]},{"location":"blog/2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#arise-acolytes-of-adaptation","title":"Arise, Acolytes of Adaptation!","text":"<p>We won't make progress on anything without a cogent and comprehensive definition of the problem we're dealing with.\u00a0</p> <p>When we talk about climate change, we're often referring to a more complex set of changes linked to the consequences of human activity on the surrounding environment.\u00a0</p> <p>A team of researchers has helpfully enumerated each of the nine planetary processes that are essential for maintaining the stability and resilience of the earth as a whole. The extra large illustration below shows those nine systems, as well as the riskiness of their current state.</p>   ![Graphic depicting the nine biological systems that are essential for the biosphere to continue supporting life and their present state. ](images/Planetary-boundaries.png)    _Source: Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research_   <p>Climate change is just one of these nine processes, and CO2 concentration is not even its most acutely stressed facet at the moment. That distinction belongs to radiative forcing, which is what happens when the amount of energy entering earth's atmosphere is greater than the amount that leaves it.</p> <p>This framework invites us to think about the sustainability of activities in a fuller context. Take cutting down a forest for example: it has carbon implications to be sure, but also can lead the earth to absorb more solar radiation if the ground is darker than the forest that used to cover it.\u00a0</p> <p>Such activity also removes habitat, which can lead to the endangerment and extinction of species and a loss of genetic diversity in the biosphere. If the forest were to be replaced with farmland, there would likely also be increases in biogeochemical flows from the introduction of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Pesticides and other chemicals would likely come alongside them, introducing novel entities into the environment. And the farm would also have to be irrigated, which presages changes in freshwater use.\u00a0</p> <p>These connections are straightforward once they've been illuminated, but will likely be new to most readers. If nothing else, they highlight how intricately linked these systems are and allow us to imagine the non-monetary costs associated with upsetting them further. </p> <p>But that's not all: they are also confounding for ideologues, who often put forward one big solution for all of the planet's woes. </p> <p>Take electrification for example. The quote below that Larry shares from Mark Mills is undeniably true today:\u00a0</p> <p>The world already digs up an amount of earth equal to 7000 Great Pyramids per year to shift from gas, oil, and coal to the minerals required for the energy transition. These include nickel, cadmium, tellurium, obviously lithium, and cobalt among other minerals. You would have to dig up 50,000 Pyramids' worth of the Earth each year to get [enough of] those minerals [to complete the transition].\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>All of that mining already has drastic consequences for the biosphere. To keep this essay readable, I'll refrain from enumerating all of them.\u00a0</p> <p>But readers rooting for the immediate and wholesale replacement of fossil fuels should be aware that they're advocating for something with profound spillover effects.\u00a0</p> <p>So where does that leave us?\u00a0</p> <p>The messy gray area where progress actually happens. </p> <p>In a perfect world, we could rely on a combination of environmental markets and regulation to accurately price the external costs associated with all human activities.</p> <p>That world sounds nice, but we don't live there.</p> <p>So as we think about how to reduce the harm associated with human activity, we need to resist one size fits all solutions and seek instead to understand the checkerboard of local realities that create the global energy picture. And the reality is that burning oil or natural gas would be a huge improvement in some places, since it would replace dirtier energy sources like coal.\u00a0</p> <p>For as long as the world remains imperfect, it's incumbent upon analysts like me and Larry to embrace the reality that many things can be true at once. There is no \"magic bullet\" solution waiting in the wings to relieve our planet's many stresses, nor a simple tradeoff between economic growth and sustainability. </p> <p>We live in a world with finite resources but infinite desires. And over the past century, we've allowed those desires to set the economic agenda without much interference.\u00a0</p> <p>None of us can put forward a complete solution to solve the climate crisis while preserving our economic prosperity, and we should acknowledge that at every opportunity. After all, we are in the business of making decisions amid conditions of uncertainty. And people often think that means we know much more than we actually do.\u00a0</p> <p>That's why, as we close this exploration, it feels important to draw attention to the malignant overconfidence with which us finance types can sometimes trod through thorny ethical terrain.\u00a0</p> <p>If we come to believe that we can speak with certitude on behalf of people we have never met about their own best interest, we imperil our ability to serve our social function, weaken our standing as a profession, and diminish ourselves individually in the process.</p> <p>The only thing we can know about the future is that it's coming.

Are they heading toward a series of rate cuts?</p> <p>The Federal Reserve is and has always been data-dependent, which means they are responding to the underlying economic reality in an adaptive way. There has been some criticism that they have been a little slow to cut, but I think people need to understand that rate cuts are not something to get excited about. They're a symptom of a weakening economy! So, I expect that if we continue to see signs of developing weakness, we will continue to see cuts, but I would be shocked if they depart from that data-dependent framework.</p> <p>What was your reaction to the Fed's decision to cut rates by 0.50%, higher than the typical 0.25% reduction?</p> <p>I think they did their job. The markets would have rebelled if they didn't get some kind of concerted action and a tangible response to the criticism that the Fed has been behind the curve in the economic cycle. It doesn't really factor into the way that we view companies or the way that we see the world, except that we are grateful to have a prudent central bank that acts in a disciplined way to advance its dual mandate of managing inflation and unemployment.</p> <p>What will a rate cut (or cuts) mean for stock market investors? Any big changes?</p> <p>We've seen a rally in some of the more interest rate-sensitive, lower quality companies that tend to have a lot of debt. But for most long-term investors, it's insane to be predicating investment decisions on reading the tea leaves and trying to see what a couple of guys in Washington are going to do in the near term. The heart of building portfolios is finding fundamental economic needs addressed by good companies and owning them throughout whatever may come. That is not going to change because of an act of the Federal Reserve, no matter what the action.</p> <p>How will the rate cut impact various sectors like housing, loans, and savings?</p> <p>This is where the impact of the Fed's action is really going to be felt. A lot of loans and savings products are floating rate, which means that when interest rates change, so does the yield that savers receive and borrowers pay. I know a lot of households are feeling anxiety right now, and it's hard to imagine that a slightly lower interest payment won't be helpful at the margin.</p> <p>On the saver's side of things, there's likely to be increased concern about how to generate income from capital. But it will remain possible, and it's important to remember that we've been through a period of really low interest rates that lasted for most of my adult life, so we will get through this.</p> <p>On the corporate side of things, a lot of lower-quality companies have effectively gotten a reprieve from the lowering of interest rates. That's because they often carry large amounts of debt, and the reduction in interest rates flows almost directly to their bottom line. I expect that will be a relatively passing phenomenon. I don't consider that to be a way to build durable value.</p> <p>People who are in debt, especially the most indebted folks, are breathing a small sigh of relief for sure.</p> <p>How will the rate cut affect the average American?</p> <p>I'm not sure the rate cut will affect the average American, but the conditions that gave rise to it certainly will. The Fed was pointing to increased risks to the unemployment outlook in their release, and it's hard to imagine that not affecting the average American. The government support during Covid led to household balance sheets that were unusually cash-rich for the United States, and that effect has largely subsided by now. The money has been spent.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, a lot of people are having a hard time getting by. We see that the most indebted folks are really having a tough time. And they're not indebted because of moral failure; they're indebted because it's hard to make ends meet.</p> <p>That creates a precarity that tends to pervade how one sees the world. And so I think at a very deep level, every American has been affected by this underlying reality.</p> <p>Should market investors look for opportunities during a rate cut phase? If so, what stock market opportunities might work for them?</p> <p>Investors should always be looking for opportunities. That's how we keep our portfolios fresh! This is a business where you have to kill your darlings (sell positions you like) sometimes in order to stay disciplined, which means it's important to be continuously looking at what else you could own instead of only focusing on the things that you currently own.</p> <p>We've been finding significant opportunities overseas. A lot of European industrial companies are regarded poorly by international investors, but we find that they are often very high-quality companies trading at compelling valuations with an acute appreciation of their stakeholders' needs. Over the course of the last couple of months, we've been able to upgrade and upgrade and upgrade our Growth portfolio (our flagship long-term investment strategy) to the point where it's trading at a cash flow yield that's more than five times that of our index. Those opportunities are out there!</p> <p>We also manage an income strategy that has had a really excellent couple of months of performance by investing in preferred stocks, pools of loans, and longer-maturity corporate bonds. I expect that approach will continue to pay dividends both figuratively and literally.</p> <p>What about bank savers (CDs and money markets)? What does a rate cut or two mean for them?</p> <p>I generally don't think that long-term investors should be using bank savings products for a couple of reasons. First of all, CDs in the best cases generate rates of return that are not much higher than the inflation we've experienced. It can be riskier, but for people who genuinely are trying to put money away for a longer period of time, I think it's kind of foolish not to get the capital markets involved at least a little bit.</p> <p>I think that's because CDs are basically contracts in which the bank wins no matter what interest rates do. If rates go up, they've locked you in at an existing rate. If rates go down, you don't get any mark-to-market appreciation from the value of your investment. All you get back is your principal instead of interest. Whereas with a bond, if you took out an 8% bond and rates went from 8% to 6%, you would be sitting on a hefty gain if the bond was relatively long-dated.</p> <p>That's not to say bank savings products don't have a purpose, but that purpose is often to serve very specific short and intermediate-term needs, like saving for a down payment on a house or putting money that you're going to spend on tuition somewhere so it gets a little bit of yield before it gets sent out the door. Those are appropriate uses for money market funds and CDs. But I find that many bank savers I meet do not explore these other options, and they really should.</p> <p>Any advice for investors concerned about falling interest rates and the impact on their investment and retirement portfolios?</p> <p>We're going to get through this. There are still ways to generate income. There are still ways to generate capital gains. Those will not change because of interest rates.</p> <p>But with that said, a lot of investors are operating strategies that are really more mismatched collections of tactics than truly well-thought-out investment portfolios. In general, I think fretting a lot about Fed decisions, elections, or anything like that is a symptom of an underdeveloped investment strategy.</p> <p>So anybody who's got these concerns should either call up their advisor and have a conversation or get one, because it's likely that there is a speculative element in their portfolio design that they may not even be conscious of.</p> <p>But I mean, think about it. Interest rates were pretty close to zero for most of my adult life. This moment of real tangible interest rates has been a nice breather. But it's a departure from recent history, and I worry that it may have deceived some investors into thinking that risk-free returns exist. The reality is that they don't. Even if the risks are minimal, they still exist.</p> <p>It can be kind of scary to hear that because it implies that we live in this very flimsy world. But I don't think that's the case. Throughout history, humans have found ways to respond to challenging situations and generate shared value in the process.</p> <p>That basic engine is fundamentally human. It's what's behind all of the investment returns that are generated in your portfolio. That adaptive force is innate to markets, and I think understanding and appreciating it gives us a real sense of their beauty and resilience.</p> <p>How do you think the Fed's recent rate cut will impact inflation, the job market, and GDP growth?</p> <p>I think it will help keep inflation and expectations under control and provide a little bit of support to the job market at the margin. But I don't think it's going to be a material factor in driving GDP growth. That's not the point of Federal Reserve policy. They are trying to minimize inflation and control unemployment, not manage growth. There's a clear interplay between what they do and GDP growth, but it would be concerning if they began to make decisions with an eye towards short-term economic numbers.</p>","tags":["fed","interest-rates","unemployment"]},{"location":"contact/","title":"Ethical Capital Contact","text":""},{"location":"contact/#contact-us","title":"Contact Us","text":"<p>If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us at hello@ethicic.com.</p>"},{"location":"contact/#client-forms","title":"Client Forms","text":"<p>We provide several forms to help you get started and manage your relationship with us:</p> <ul> <li>Onboarding Form - Complete this form to begin the process of becoming a client</li> <li>All Forms - View all available forms</li> </ul>"},{"location":"contact/#schedule-a-meeting","title":"Schedule a Meeting","text":"<p>Ready to talk?

They rarely make the difference between success and failure of an investment program, but can definitely be helpful at the margin.</p> <p>We encourage clients to opt into Altruist's sweep program for that reason, but clients are free not to do so.</p>"},{"location":"faq/2024-07-11-how-can-i-balance-my-own-needs-and-my-desire-to-give-generously/","title":"How can I balance my own needs and my desire to give generously?","text":"<p>When Gabe pulled together some resources to help you on your philanthropic journey, he took care to include the following guidance for folks interested in giving generously at the top of the article:</p> <p>Giving is best understood as a continuous practice, not a one-time check writing extravaganza. The most effective donors tend to view it as something they try to get better at over time, and often develop an intensely personal sense of what matters.</p> <p>In other words, even though it would be amazing to make a huge donation to your favorite organization through great personal sacrifice, it would be much healthier to support them in ways that are sustainable for you.</p> <p>That can include giving non-monetary resources like your time and energy, but also remembering that you're no good to the causes you care about if you don't take care of yourself.</p> <p>Think about what they tell you on airplanes: \"put on your own oxygen mask first before assisting other passengers.\" This is intensely practical! If you help others without thinking about yourself, you stand a very good chance of making things worse overall by putting yourself into a position where you need saving.</p> <p>So what should you do? Here are a couple of steps that might feel productive and impactful apart from volunteering:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Identify the organizations you'd like to support and put them in your will. That way the organizations you care about will get your resources when you're no longer using them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Organize a get-together with a suggested donation to your favorite organization. For bonus points, provide some resources to the folks who attend that help them see why the cause matters to you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spend time amplifying messages from activists and organizations you care about on your social media platforms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide in advance to give a percentage of any extra money you come into to causes you care about, but only if it doesn't put your personal finances in peril.</p> </li> <li> <p>Take steps to be someone that others can rely on in emergency situations by keeping things like naloxone and band-aids handy while you're out moving through the world.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The most important thing to remember is that you're not alone.

For a small fee, one has the opportunity to listen to five lectures given by professors from various universities around the country\u2014largely the Ivy League.  One professor was especially wonderful.  Professor Shawn Achor from Harvard teaches the most popular course on campus\u2014a course which roughly addresses the age old issue:  How to be Happy.  I thought some of his ideas might be useful to you.  His interest in the Science of Happiness was piqued when he got to Harvard and found, to his great surprise, that there were many undergraduates who suffer from depression.  Within broader measures of society, it also turns out that current levels of unhappiness and depression are eight times higher than they were during the Great Depression.  Additionally, the onset of depressive episodes for those who are subject to them has dropped from 29.5 to 14.5 years of age.  Achor decided that he wanted to discover why, and to come up with some strategies which might counter these tendencies.  William James believed that anything you do for 21 days becomes a habit\u2014good or bad.  Current research indicates that it is actually 28 days.  Achor suggests that we adopt some habits which can help us be happier, and here are five ways in which we can learn to handle negative energy and stress in more positive ways:  1. Three gratitudes\u2014Before you go to bed each night, write down three things that you're grateful for.  The more specific your list, the better.  You'll experience a bump in happiness for the next 24 hours, and your brain will become more skilled at avoiding hassles and stresses. 2. Journal\u2014A few times in the coming week, take 10 minutes to write in your journal about a recent positive experience.  People who do this at least 3 times a week report enhanced positive mood and a 50% drop in doctors visits up to three months later. 3. Simplify\u2014Do more by doing less.  Remember that performing an activity while multi-tasking is the equivalent of lowering your IQ by 10 points. 4. Exercise\u2014You've heard about the physical benefits a thousand times, but now remember the mental benefits: research shows that 30 minutes of exercise is the equivalent of taking an anti-depressant.  Even 10 minutes a day will make a real difference.  5. Meditate\u2014Take 5 minutes to sit quietly and watch your breath go in and out. Try to clear your mind of other thoughts and just think about your breathing. People who do this on a regular basis experience less stress, enjoy more energy, and bounce back from illness faster.  Anchor contends that happier brains make for more successful people.  In fact, he believes that happiness is necessary for success.  When one is facing difficult times\u2014and we all will at some time or another\u2014a positive mindset will help a great deal, as will the support of family and friends.  When you are happy is the time to create your \"Board of Directors\"\u2014a group of people with whom you can be honest\u2014whose advice you seek and respect.  Do not close the door on important life relationships that can be of tremendous value to you when you inevitably shift into survival mode.     We all know the phrase \"Practice random acts of kindness and perform senseless acts of beauty.\"  Well, do just that.  Every day, for 1-2 minutes, sit down and send an email to someone saying something kind to them.  Your parents for raising you, your sister or brother for not beating you up, your teacher for caring, your boyfriend for his compassion.  It doesn't matter. They will benefit from it, but so will you.  It's a karma thing.   Sad to say, at Harvard, just as at Stuyvesant, students enter having been at the top of their class throughout their school career.  Once there, they discover that 50 % of students there are in the bottom half of the class, and that that 50% might just include them.  A shock, to say the least.  So counteract that shock by adopting some of these habitual actions which might make a difference in your life.  Professor Achor contends:  \"Traditional psychology seeks to discover trends or averages.  If you dip below the curve, psychologists help you get back up to normal.  But what lies above normal?  Who are the happiest people, the most productive, the most resilient?  I believe that if we only study the average, we will remain average.  If we want to see what we are truly capable of, we should study those who lie above the curve.\"    Let's be above the curve!!"},{"location":"keynes/2014-05-11-homework-resume-project/","title":"Homework: Resume Project","text":"<p>H8--RESUME EXAM</p> <p>Get a job!!!</p> <p>Your task has three parts:\u00a0</p> <ol> <li>Write a job description for the actual job you think you want to do when you grow up\u2014(see monster.com for some ideas.)
