Our process is oriented towards evolving portfolio principles and continuous vigilance, so I spend most of my time deeply understanding companies, their impact, and ensuring our portfolios genuinely reflect our clients' values rather than superficial ESG metrics.</p> <p>Building relationships with our clients grounds our approach. Understanding their experiences, values, and what cognitive harmony means to them drives everything we do\u2014we're committed to eliminating the dissonance between values and investments.</p> My Ethical Investment Journey <p>I've been working in investment management since I graduated from high school, but my path to ethics-first investing came through seeing the limitations of conventional approaches.</p> <p>After spending time at a regional brokerage firm and a Bangalore-based family office, I joined the nonprofit CFA Institute while still a sophomore in college.</p> <p>I then spent close to a decade partnering with some of the most interesting investors globally to create educational materials aimed at advancing investment management. In the process, I wrote dozens of articles, edited hundreds, and spoke to investment professionals worldwide.</p> <p>I realized that mainstream firms were only scratching the surface of ethical investing\u2014mostly using it as a marketing angle rather than a fundamental approach. I saw the need for a firm that genuinely put ethics first, acknowledged the complexities of ethical investing honestly, and created true alignment between values and investments.</p> Community Perspective <p>As a queer leader in finance, I understand what it means to navigate spaces where your identity and values might not be reflected. This lived experience shapes our firm's approach to intersectional ethics and our commitment to treating investments as an expression of your complete identity.</p> <p>Our predominantly queer client base informs how we think about values across multiple dimensions. We built Ethical Capital to be the kind of firm we wished existed\u2014one that understands the connection between identity, values, and financial decisions without forcing compromises that create cognitive dissonance.</p> Revenue Is Impact Approach <p>I developed our \"Revenue Is Impact\" framework after seeing how many ethical funds rely on companies doing good with profits after harmful business activities. Our approach is fundamentally different\u2014we select companies that generate positive impact through their core business activities, creating an inseparable link between financial success and ethical outcomes.</p> <p>This approach, combined with our concentrated portfolios and evolving portfolio principles, creates a genuinely different investment experience\u2014one where you can fully understand and believe in every company you own.</p> Things I've Written <p>If you want to understand my personal journey, this essay on how I became an ethics-first investment manager is the best place to start.</p> <p>Besides that, here are a few other pieces I've written that reflect our distinctive approach:</p> <ul> <li>Why ESG Investing Has Been Such a Letdown</li> <li>Revenue Is Impact: Beyond Performative Ethics</li> <li>The Truth About Being \"Wrong About 15%\" in Ethical Investing</li> <li>Beyond Divestment: Constructive Ethical Investing in a Complex World</li> <li>Cognitive Harmony: Why Aligning Values and Investments Matters</li> </ul> <p>I've also written a textbook on investment idea generation and essays on reimagining finance through an ethical lens.</p> <p>If you want to understand the values that drive my approach, check out Can Financial Advisers Make Their Clients Happy and Finance Shouldn't Think Small, which I wrote almost ten years ago.</p> Beyond Ethical Capital <ul> <li>Co-host Free Money with Sloane and Ashby, where we often discuss ethical investing without the typical industry jargon</li> <li>Spend as much time as I can justify skiing at one of Utah's many awesome resorts</li> <li>Practice what I preach by replacing my lawn with perennial wildflowers and other compelling habitats for wildlife</li> <li>Serve as a board member at Responsible Alpha, a consultancy supporting organizations in their transition towards authentic sustainability</li> <li>Support my colleagues at the Woodcache Public Benefit Corporation, a carbon removal company I co-founded</li> <li>Advocate for inclusive financial spaces that understand the connection between identity and investment decisions</li> </ul> Speaking Engagements <p>I speak candidly about the realities of ethical investing\u2014both its potential and its limitations.

Wait long enough, and you literally get to see flowers blooming in stuff that would have been sent to a landfill.</p> <p>And through the process of caring for your pile, you get up close and personal with the microorganisms that make our planet habitable. They turn cardboard, carrot shavings, avocado skins, and whatever else you throw at them into a cornucopia of life.</p> <p>The human's job in all of this is simple: give them the time, space, and air they need.</p> <p>I think it's analogous to what I do here in a few ways. First and foremost, I'm responsible for the pile of assets clients have entrusted to me. I stir it up when it needs air, do my best to keep pests out, and pay attention to everything that happens inside of it. Because it's my job to make sure it'll be there in the best possible form when my clients need it.</p> <p>But the similarities don't stop there. Here are a few more investment lessons from the compost pile:</p> <ol> <li> <p>It's a privilege. The physical space that's required for a good compost setup is hard to attain for most people. As a lifelong New Yorker, perhaps I appreciate this better than most. I wasn't able to start until after my 32nd birthday because I had no outdoor space to call my own. Similarly, the raw materials required to build an investment portfolio are out of most people's reach because the key resource is money. And most people don't have a lot of it. That's why I designed this firm so that we could work with people who share my values regardless of how much they have available to invest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Time is in charge. There's no sense in trying to rush compost. I'm sure someone would be happy to sell you a high-end machine that speeds things along, but that isn't needed or necessary if you approach your pile with patience. The same thing is true with investing. There are all sorts of trading strategies that people use to try and accelerate things, but the result often unnatural, costly, and worse than the returns that accrue to patient investors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balance is everything. Most compost piles feature a roughly three pounds of \"browns\" like shredded cardboard or dead leaves for every pound of \"greens\" like table scraps and plant cuttings. The balance ensures that the microorganisms in the pile have the correct amounts of carbon for energy and nitrogen for protein production. Similarly, portfolios should balance out investments in higher-risk innovative companies with allocations to more established enterprises and sustainable real estate to ensure we have enough stability to weather whatever may happen in the market.</p> </li> <li> <p>Diligence matters. Anything that makes it into your compost pile may eventually wind up in your food. So it's important to make sure that the plastic wrappers, cigarette butts, and other miscellaneous waste that often materializes outdoors (at least here in Brooklyn) get dealt with safely. I run all of the soil through a variety of screens to make sure nothing bad makes it into my garden, and I do the same thing with the companies in our portfolio to ensure they reflect the values of our clients and their communities in addition to solid risk-adjusted return opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nothing is wasted. Even just having a compost pile changes the way a garden works. Plants that don't make it get reconstituted into the rich, black earth that feeds the next generation. It's the same way with investing, where we're able to learn something from every opportunity we analyze, even if we only wind up investing in a handful of them.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I hope that's been an enjoyable exploration of some commonalities between tending a garden and taking care of an investment portfolio! If this has piqued your curiosity, you might be interested to learn more about our strategies.</p> <p>If you're interested in learning more about composting, here are a few great places to start:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Rodale Institute has conducted pioneering research into organic agriculture</p> </li> <li> <p>r/composting is an active community of fellow composters</p> </li> <li> <p>The Cornell Waste Management Institute has great resources on composting from a variety of perspectives</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["compost","investing","process"]},{"location":"blog/2022/01/03/evaluating-our-investment-performance/","title":"Evaluating our Investment Performance","text":"<p>It is not straightforward to measure the performance of an investment strategy like ours.</p> <p>That's because:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Our ethical criteria eliminates more than half of the companies that comprise popular indexes like the S&amp;P 500 from consideration,</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Sustainable\" indices tend to concentrate their holdings in technology companies like Facebook, Tesla, and Google we also exclude on moral grounds, and</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>We invest globally, which makes it difficult to compare our results with stock markets in any particular country.</li> </ul> <p>I could do a lot of complicated calculations to produce a more appropriate benchmark, but I don't feel that would help you understand what's happening in the portfolio any better. Instead, we will simply use the MSCI ACWI (a widely used global index) as our benchmark until a more straightforward approach emerges.</p> <p>In the chart that follows, our portfolio's daily returns (purple) for the quarter that just ended are presented alongside the index (orange). These returns are net of fees, and though I feel it's important to share them with you regularly and transparently, I have to stress that they tell you close to nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>That's because we are investing to build security and stability over the long term, not to produce a line that looks good on this chart over an arbitrary three month period. The pride and confidence that I have in our portfolio stems from the disciplined process that I followed to construct it and the deep research that has gone into each of its constituents.</p> <p>Still, it's nice that we were up 4.03% in our first quarter. Most people agree that it's better to be up than down. But it bears mentioning that we will lose money sometimes, because we invest in securities that fluctuate in value over the short term for reasons that are beyond mortal understanding.</p> <p>But that doesn't mean there's no point in doing the research.

It is a mission-driven lender chartered by Congress to create a secondary market for agricultural credit and one of the most important actors in America's farm credit system. </p> <p>In a sense, this business is straightforward. Farmer Mac buys agricultural loans from regional banks, passing on the benefit of their federal government guarantees to rural America through cheaper and more widely available credit. The company estimates that farmers and ranchers invest $2 locally for every $1 they save on interest expenses, meaning that this benefit reaches deep into pockets of American society that are just plain difficult to access.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>The impact of Farmer Mac\u2019s partnerships with regional banks is also profound. These relationships allow the banks to retain generational relationships even as the value of farmland appreciates beyond their loan limits (which it often does), and stay ahead of less community-minded competitors.</p> <p>The underlying business dynamics are nothing short of beautiful. Like most banks, the company's main profit engine is the \u201cspread\u201d between its cost of borrowing and the interest it receives from borrowers. And Farmer Mac is able to borrow remarkably inexpensively thanks to its status as a Government Sponsored Enterprise.\u00a0</p> <p>It gets better, because the company makes good loans safely. Cumulative losses in its farm and ranch segment, which represents a little less than half of its balance sheet, have been .12%. That\u2019s a little more than a tenth of 1%! The other three segments have never reported a credit loss, and the company carries roughly five times as much capital as risk-based measures indicate is required thanks to tight regulations.\u00a0</p> <p>The outlook for financial growth is strong. Farmer Mac holds just a 5.7% share of the overall US agricultural mortgage market, and has grown its overall business volume at a compounded 10.3% per annum over the twenty years from 2000 to 2020. 99% of this business volume is recurring net effective spread and fees, which makes it reasonable to assume that this growth (and the company\u2019s 16% return on equity) will be durable.\u00a0</p> <p>What excites me most, though, is the opportunity for impact that owning these shares affords us. Farmer Mac is uniquely positioned to shape the US agricultural market, support the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, and ensure that our coming adaptation to the realities of climate change does not needlessly displace farming communities. And though our shares are officially non-voting, our ownership stake gives us a seat at the table to advocate for policies that will reduce harm to animals throughout the agricultural system while supporting sustained economic prosperity.</p>","tags":["global-opportunities"]},{"location":"blog/2022/02/09/dont-stop-with-divestment/","title":"Don't Stop With Divestment","text":"<p>Fossil duel divestment is all the rage these days, with bellwethers like the Harvard University endowment joining a decades-long movement to banish hydrocarbons from their investment programs.</p> <p>According to the Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Commitments Database, they join 1500 other institutions representing a total of $39.88 trillion that have taken such steps.

Wally Davis and Chuck Posternak hired me as an intern at what's now the Grand Central Private Client Group. I was paid $15 an hour to build spreadsheets that described clients' financial situations and our associated asset management positioning.</p> <p>It ruled.</p> <p>I got to meet with fund managers, build models, and generally research stuff to my heart's content. I also had unrestricted access to a Bloomberg terminal, which was one of the more exciting developments of my adolescence. But it wasn't my first contact with markets. That came much earlier thanks to my parents, who were both enterprising in their careers and open with their experiences as I was growing up.</p> <p>My mom liked to joke that she taught me the difference between debt and equity before I could ride a bike. Which is more or less true. She and my dad had an imperfect marriage, but their shared interest in the capital markets gave them a source of conversation on long car rides. Mom eventually left her career at Lehman Brothers to teach AP economics at Stuyvesant High School (Forbes wrote a great piece about that transition) so I guess it makes sense that I think of myself as her first student in addition to her first child. The picture above is me playing with her briefcase shortly after I learned to walk.</p> <p>My dad is also one of the most insightful analysts I've ever met. While I was cutting my teeth at Oppenheimer in 2007, he was warning everyone who would listen about leverage in the financial system and pushing the investment community to re-evaluate companies like General Electric that had become addicted to financial engineering. I still watch his first tv appearance about it every once in a while as a reminder of how deeply the markets can misunderstand a company.</p> <p>Even with these fantastic firsthand experiences, I struggled to understand why individual investors should invest their money in anything but index funds.</p> <p>This chart, which shows the total return of both General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 since dad first went on TV to talk about it, gives a good sense of why.</p>   ![](images/koyfin_20240523_054134722-1024x529.png)    Returns for General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 Index since August 15th, 2009   <p>An investor who decided to bet against GE after dad's interview aired would have had to incur significant cost, manage mechanical complexities, and wait close to a decade for the insight to deliver any benefit to them.</p> <p>And in the meantime, a simple index fund investor would have compounded their capital faster and had more time to think about other things.</p> <p>That's what I call a win-win.</p> <p>My confidence in this simple and straightforward approach only grew as I gained more information.</p> <p>Joining CFA Institute in 2010 gave me an opportunity to dive deep into state of the art academic research that surrounds the practice of investment management in a context where my sole responsibility was to highlight tools, tactics, and technologies that investment professionals make better decisions on behalf of their clients.</p> <p>I started out writing educational materials, but quickly got sucked into the organization's online community-building efforts. I was put in charge of recruiting expert voices for what eventually became the Enterprising Investor (still the #1 investing blog in the world according to Feedly) and jumped in with both feet.</p> <p>The task was to connect with the most thoughtful investors I could find and convince them to put their thoughts into writing on our platform. That led to some profoundly interesting work. Notable explorations of the difference between investing and speculation, what poker teaches us about risk, and the lessons from a famous bet with Warren Buffett are just the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>Eventually I got to add my own voice into the mix in addition to curating expert views. I wrote about what Enron can teach financial analysts, the role that faith plays in investment processes, and whether ESG and sustainability could enhance investor returns.</p> <p>We did a lot of stuff I'm proud of. I even wrote a book with my friend and mentor Jason Voss about how to come up with original investment ideas.</p> <p>I still couldn't see why individual investors would invest in anything but an index fund.</p> <p>And then I came out.</p> <p>It was 2017. I had been experiencing gender dysphoria for my whole life. And I finally felt able to do something about it besides distracting myself. I changed my name, my appearance, and my pronouns with the benefit of a supportive work environment, then prepared myself for whatever might happen when the rest of the world noticed.</p>   ![](images/CleanShot-2024-05-23-at-17.43.07-717x1024.png)    _Yours truly in Institutional Investor back when it was still a paper magazine.

I started a podcast with my friend Ashby Monk to explore how the world's most sophisticated investors were working to build a better future for finance, and began writing the \"Inclusion in Wealth\" column for Citywire RIA to explore issues around diversity, equity, and belonging in our industry.</p> <p>But I still wasn't an active manager.</p> <p>Until my girlfriend and I sat down to have the conversation about how we would invest our money, I would have said it was interesting but not particularly applicable. And yes, I would have offered a full-throated defense of index funds and passive management.</p> <p>But when we actually enumerated our values, it turned out that I held some pretty extreme views.</p> <p>Specifically:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Companies should pay their taxes,</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid preventable harm to living things, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Care for the communities where they operate.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Though I've expressed them fairly concisely above, those values actually summarize a two page, single spaced policy that excludes companies with questionable products, conduct, or both from our investment strategies.</p> <p>But however well-constructed our policy is, it's unlikely to produce compelling results unless it's part of a coherent investment process.</p> <p>There's a simple reason for that: our screening process isn't good enough.</p> <p>It can't be.</p> <p>The capital markets are literally a manifestation of the world's current power structure. Anything that people do will find a way to concretize in them somewhere. So eventually I realized there is no checklist comprehensive enough to rely upon.</p> <p>You have to pay attention.</p> <p>Because companies often talk a big game, but are absent when it comes time to come through for their communities. Because our goal is not just to identify companies that are shaping the world positively but also to generate financial stability for our clients. So I can't just buy the stuff that makes it through the screens and pretend I'm making the world a better place.</p> <p>That's not to say that index funds are bad. Far from it! I have Jack Bogle's autograph sitting above my desk, and I still think that they do an excellent job growing people's money without requiring much in the way of oversight or critical thought.</p> <p>They just have nothing to do with ethics.</p> <p>And as an ethics-first investor, I owe it to everyone evaluating my strategy to be clear that there is substantial independent judgement and discretion involved in what we do.</p> <p>We do not \"set and forget\" anything.

The availability of potash, phosphate, and fossil fuel derived agricultural inputs that we rely upon to feed earth's growing populations has already been materially reduced, and these stresses could take as long as 3-5 years to resolve.</p> <p>The timeline comes from to Peter Zeihan, an analyst I've been following for close to a decade for his sharp views on geopolitics, energy, and international trade. His YouTube channel is free, and has been illuminating during Russia's recent war of aggression, so I took the opportunity to dig a little deeper into how his views intersect with something that should be of interest to everyone on the planet: our food system.</p> <p>He would probably want me to underscore one point at the outset of this exploration: modern agriculture is an industrial process. It's true that regenerative approaches are growing in popularity, but at the moment only about 5.5 million of the United States' roughly 900 million acres of farmland is certified organic. That's well under one percent.</p> <p>So as a practical matter, synthetic fertilizers are currently supporting about half of the world's population.</p> <p></p> <p>The chart above is stark enough before we pause to consider that supply chain disruptions (and the most acute threats to food security) are not evenly distributed around the world.</p> <p>North America is unique in that we have plentiful sources of potash, phosphate, and natural gas in close proximity to our midwestern \"breadbasket.\" Only a few other places in the world are so fortunate:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Eighty percent of global potash production comes from Canada, China, Belarus, or Russia.</p> </li> <li> <p>China, Morocco, and the United States produce two thirds of the world's phosphate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Russia and the United States are the world's two largest producers of natural gas.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You may have noticed that Russia featured twice in that list. Both Mr. Putin's Petrostate and allied Belarus are now subject to sanctions, which effectively takes a non-trivial portion of the market offline.</p> <p>It's too soon to tell what this will mean exactly, but just a few days ago the Interim Chief Executive of Nutrien, the world's biggest fertilizer producer, said \"We are going to run our plants. Run them flat out. Could we see interruptions in exports out of Russia? Yes. Can we see plant closures? We could.\"</p> <p>Such a disruption would be poorly timed, since the northern hemisphere's temperate agricultural regions will be in the full bloom of spring before too long. And fertilizer only works if you put it on the plants before they grow.

They need to be extracted, transported, refined, and then transported again to reach their final destinations.</p> <p>Upon arrival, they also have an unfortunate tendency to leach into groundwater and literally strangle waterways with out-of-control algal blooms. But even if those negative effects could be contained, farmers would still need to keep spending substantial sums re-applying these treatments every year. And their soil wouldn't be any better off after all of the expense and complexity involved.</p> <p>Farmers will do their best to adapt. Some might stop planting corn in favor of soy, which needs less fertilizer to grow than conventional cultivation methods. They might even take steps towards adopting regenerative practices by using manure in place of expensive fertilizers.</p> <p>But that won't help the folks in the global south who are already facing food insecurity.</p> <p></p> <p>It's hard to pinpoint where on the planet these pressures will manifest, but one can safely and sadly assume that the darkest-tinted countries in the map above are set to carry most of the weight.</p> <p>This is a policy choice. And delaying our adaptation leaves many vulnerable populations around the world needlessly exposed to famine.</p> <p>Even if we were to forget how to make synthetic fertilizer, we could still adapt our agricultural system to feed everybody on earth and entirely mitigate the risk of famine by phasing out animal agriculture.

Google search volume for the word \"recession\" is already higher than it was in 2008, and the mainstream press is starting to write about slowing economic activity with some regularity.</p> <p>It's natural to wonder what this means. After all, most people assume that a recession is one of the most significant risks to their savings. There is certainly truth to that. The S&amp;P 500 is down almost 20% so far this year, and it's likely that many investors have experienced similar declines in the value of their holdings.</p> <p>What happens next?</p> <p>No-one can say with certainty how the rest of the year will unfold. But this is a profound opportunity to learn from history because this isn't the first time that the US economy has slowed down. The National Bureau of Economic Research maintains a handy database of prior instances and we spent some time examining it for indications of how the future might unfold.</p> <p>One crucial thing to understand is that no-one rings a bell at the onset of a recession. They are generally only recognized in retrospect, when economists can confidently identify peaks and troughs in economic activity.</p> <p>The chart below is meant to illustrate one of the most important practical implications of this: by the time an official recession determination is announced, the recession is usually over. The grey bars indicate recessionary periods and the purple bars indicate when those recessions were announced.</p> <p></p> <p>Buying stocks during the month a recession was announced generated an average return of 16.19% one year later.</p> <p>But much more importantly, remaining committed to one's long-term plan allowed investors to experience the profound growth that unfolded over the subsequent decades. Even terrifying periods like 2008's great recession were no match for patience and the power of compounding.</p> <p>Focus on what matters</p> <p>The real risk of a recession is that it will scare us into making suboptimal financial choices like staying away from the stock market, selling our existing holdings, and buying expensive \"protection\" from further market declines.</p> <p>These mistakes can be immensely seductive! I've got no doubt that there is someone making slick tiktok videos right now about complex trading strategies that purport to preserve the value of portfolios no matter what happens in the market. Your best bet is to ignore these, because they have a way of shifting focus away from what matters: your long-term investment objectives.</p> <p>Families, individuals, and institutions often forget that the simple act of centering these goals produces a profound sense of strategic clarity. In many cases, the money we manage is meant to meet goals that won't materialize for more than thirty years.</p> <p>That's roughly the entire amount of time shown in the chart above! It can be hard to picture yourself that far into the future, but it's worth a try. Because by then, you'll have almost no recollection of today's fears, just a sense of gratitude to your past self for sticking with the plan.</p>","tags":["economics","global-opportunities"]},{"location":"blog/2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/","title":"Stock Market Performance: What Should You Expect When You're Investing?","text":"<p>The stock market is... complicated.</p> <p>But despite that, it is possible to construct useful understandings of how it behaves through careful study of its long-term performance.</p> <p>Before we get into that though, let's make sure we share a functional understanding of what we're talking about.

We may love our crocs (and be wearing them as we write this essay) but that doesn't mean we can see the company's future clearly.</p> <p>But when we combine individual stocks into a well-constructed portfolio, things get much easier to predict. Imagine that you purchased shares in the S&amp;P 500 index, which is among the most widely used and studied indices, back in 1980. If you were to fall asleep for the next twenty years, you would probably have been very pleasantly surprised when you woke up and checked your brokerage statement.</p> <p>To give you a sense of how good that surprise would be, we've excerpted the chart below from an excellent review of risk management practices published by Sloane's former colleagues at the CFA Institute Research Foundation. This shows the market's returns on a logarithmic scale, which shows exponential growth much more clearly than the linear charts you might be more familiar with.</p> <p>You don't have to worry too much about those math words though: we've included this chart to convey that there is a clear pattern of gradual ascent in long-term stock returns. Just look how the line goes from bottom left to top right!</p>   ![](images/CleanShot-2024-05-23-at-17.29.59.png)    _Source: CFA Institute Research Foundation, [Managing Material Risk](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/research/foundation/2022/rfbr-managing-material-risk)_   <p>So, if stock market returns are historically consistent, why is the stock market risky?</p> <p>One could easily write a PhD thesis on this topic, and many people have. It's complicated! But our goal in this essay is to leave you with a well-grounded understanding of how stocks behave, and it's possible to get there without resorting to pursuing a graduate degree.</p> <p>If you look at the chart above, you can see that returns oscillated between flat and negative for more than a decade after the year 2000. The 1970s were similarly non-wonderful times to own stocks. These things have happened, and likely will happen again!</p> <p>But the important thing to remember is that they also usually stop happening eventually. And when they do, stocks' long-term tendency to appreciate has historically returned in force. So there are significant practical rewards to adopting a patient posture that embraces this reality.</p> <p>That's true in triplicate when you zoom in to consider what might happen in any given year. The chart below shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index - the same one we examined above - has declined an average of 14.3% at some point in each of the last 43 years.</p> <p>Those declines are shown in red on the chart below, but they're only half of the story. The grey bars on the same chart show the returns for each full year. And despite some sort of decline occurring like clockwork every single year, the stock market managed to notch a positive performance almost three quarters of the time.</p>   ![Chart of the largest intra-year decline for the S&amp;P 500 since 1980 alongside each full year's performance. ](images/image-1-1024x576.png)    Source: J.P. Morgan Asset Management, [Guide to the Markets, Q2 2023](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/)   <p>At this point, it's probably beginning to make a lot of sense why stocks are usually seen of the cornerstone of a long-term investment portfolio: if you can ignore, indulge, or otherwise plan for their volatility, they have an extremely well-documented tendency to turn money into more money.</p> <p>We'll get back to bonds in a second, but before we go there, let's just lay out what we learned in this section:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Stocks go down at some point every single year.</p> </li> <li> <p>They still managed to finish the year up about 75% of the time.</p> </li> <li> <p>To capture these returns, stay invested!</p> </li> </ul> <p>But is this really all that different from the way bonds behave? After all, many people we talk to aren't particularly motivated by extracting every last iota of investment return from the market. They just want to live their lives with a reasonable sense that when they need money sometime in the future, there will be enough of it.</p>","tags":["diversification","returns"]},{"location":"blog/2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#how-do-stocks-compare-to-bonds-and-other-assets","title":"How do Stocks Compare to Bonds and Other Assets?","text":"<p>The book Stocks for the Long Run by Wharton professor Jeremy J.

If you'd like to access that full discussion just click the image below. But give it a gander in any case, because I want to tell you a few things about it.</p> <p></p> <p>At a high level, the premise of this chart is that the vague idea of \"aligning with a more sustainable future\" can be broken up into four parts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Managing externalities. This is the most basic reason that ESG (and the associated data) are important. Having access to information about the composition of a company's workforce, the carbon intensity of its operations, and the long-term planning processes it uses to prepare for a range of possible futures helps us know that their operations are not creating negative consequences for surrounding communities. Crucially, this can also help us gain confidence that the company is insulated from negative surprises, which goes a long way towards mitigating risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aligning with growth trends. Any version of \"building a better world\" includes building new tools, technologies, and infrastructure. And whether we're talking about safe housing for seniors, scaling renewable energy generation, or building better software for teachers, paying careful attention to what the world needs is a big help when designing investment portfolios. As analysts, we're able to work backwards from what's needed, identify large growth opportunities, and then ensure we own companies that are well-placed to meet those needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoiding stranded assets. As climate change unfolds and humanity reacts to it, substantial disruptions in financial markets are all but certain to emerge. These will never be entirely avoidable, but they are somewhat forseeable. Take the case of fossil fuels, which will hopefully be substantially less widely used sometime in the next couple of decades. The financial think tank Carbon Tracker estimates that $1 trillion of oil and gas assets are at serious risk of becoming worthless as a result.</p> </li> <li> <p>Driving real-world impact. This is what most people think of when \"sustainable investing\" comes up. It's difficult to deliver and even more difficult to quantify, which has left many people with false understandings of what's possible. With that said, all of the strategies we manage seek to avoid preventable harm to living things while also contributing to positive real-world outcomes. With that said, we do our best to learn from the industry's past mistakes when discussing this with our clients, and will always seek to underpromise and over-deliver.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each of these four components of \"building a better world\" is worth thinking about in isolation, but as a practical matter it's worth remembering that we pursue them is all at once. There is a substantial difference between driving positive change in the real world and protecting your hard-earned dollars, but we pursue them all at the same time as part of an integrated process.</p>","tags":["esg","investing","ratings"]},{"location":"blog/2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#reasonable-expectations-the-key-to-satisfaction","title":"Reasonable Expectations: The Key to Satisfaction","text":"<p>We focus on making sure that our clients have reasonable expectations about what to expect from the funds they entrust to us.

Fluorescent lights also turn dolls green, which obviously damages and devalues them.</p> <p>The original material can also create vast deviations in condition, value, and price.</p> <p>For example, French and German dolls of the early 1800s were made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.

But we believe great businesses are built in downturns like these, and as long-term investors we have complete confidence in the management team led by the indefatigable Badri Kothandraraman.</p> </li> <li> <p>Crocs (CROX) was the second-largest detractor from performance after momentum slowed at Heydude, a footwear brand it acquired in early 2022. This has produced a degree of financial indigestion as markets struggled to make sense of what to expect from the newly combined entity. We reduced our position during the year and cannot profess blind faith in the management team. With that said, we believe shares offer compelling value at the moment, with a ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of roughly 15%.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) was the third-largest detractor from performance as the slowing commercial real estate market affected valuations of all companies included in commercial real estate indices. But Alexandria's hyper-specialized business of providing lab space to innovative biotechnology companies can hardly be thought of as similar to mainstream commercial office buildings.

As a portfolio manager, one of my largest fears is that the market will come to recognize the value of this unique company before I can buy even more of it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Duolingo (DUOL) The market afforded us the opportunity to buy into this remarkably impactful firm at a discount to its IPO price, and we did so in size. In the ensuing months, an old-school bubble in everything and anything vaguely linked to AI took hold, and the price appreciated significantly. We're no longer holding quite as many shares of this firm. But we challenge anyone to watch CEO Luis Von Ahn's 2011 TED talk on the thesis for Duolingo and walk away anything but inspired and excited. Today, shares are only about 70% above their summer 2021 IPO price, and the company continues to grow revenues at a remarkably stable 40% a year.</p> </li> <li> <p>TopBuild (BLD) I can't help but smile every time I think of this position, which we've held since the strategy's inception. In 2022, market prognosticators were calling for a recession, which cut the price of this insulation distributor down to half the current level because sales of insulation products are broadly seen as tied to the housing cycle. But the compelling operational footprint that this company has carefully assembled over decades combined with the real-world cost savings that good insulation offers building owners to create a wonderful financial equation as they thoughtfully consolidate their industry over the coming decades.</p> </li> <li> <p>E.L.F. Beauty (ELF) This company needs no introduction for any makeup users reading this piece. They produce cruelty-free competitors to costly beauty staples at a remarkable clip, and are experiencing accelerating revenue growth as they penetrate deeper into traditional sales channels while retaining an ironclad hold on gen-z and cost-conscious consumers. The only reason it's not a larger position in our portfolios is that our process requires us to be mindful of valuation, and the company is regularly in the most expensive decile across a range of metrics. With that said, we're likely to be shareholders for many years to come.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quanta Services (PWR) This company has a commanding position in infrastructure services, which includes renewable energy, communications, pipeline maintenance, and almost everything related to the electrical grid. Their approach to safety has long captivated me, and the company has been a prime beneficiary of the federal government's infrastructure spending.

But your student stakeholders are calling out for clearer moral lines about what their endowment stands to profit from.</p> <p>I don't have to tell you that we've been down this road before. With fossil fuels and for-profit prisons, tobacco companies, and plenty more. And this time around, I am urging you: take the students seriously, not just literally.</p> <p>The operational challenges of managing a modern endowment portfolio necessitate long-term planning. You've got to pace the maturation of your holdings to coincide with spending plans, produce a steady stream of consistent quality opportunities to match with incoming cash, and manage the complex communications associated with your own oversight.</p> <p>I suggest you situate this entire discussion within that oversight process. The most effective way to take the students seriously is to build a moral oversight process and reporting framework that passes their muster. With such a thing in place, you will be able to make genuine long-term commitments without worrying about subsequent challenges from stakeholders.</p> <p>There isn't one right way to build something like that: you will need to build and refine your own approach.</p> <p>But we've learned a few things over the past few years that might be helpful to other long-term investors thinking about how to merge a little more morality into the way they do money management.</p> <p>Here are a few suggestions that may be helpful.</p> <p>Embrace the Challenge</p> <p>Even if they've been operating under an ESG policy for years, deeply integrating ethical criteria into investment decision making will be new for most investment offices.</p> <p>So was crypto. But unlike the blockchain stuff, building competency here is all but guaranteed to pay dividends for your organization. Think about it: this will not be the last moral issue you have to contend with. As you prune and populate your portfolio, wouldn't it be nice to have a handle on things that may impede your ability to act as a true long-term investor?</p> <p>If you are thoughtful, earnest, and perhaps lucky, you will find a way to engage with your stakeholders that becomes a source of positive idiosyncrasy. That's a big part of what makes this firm special: our clients know that I want to hear about their moral concerns ASAP. As a result, we've got our ear to the ground in ways that would be difficult to replicate for folks who are just feigning interest.</p> <p>Make a Living List</p> <p>You will want a living document that describes the conduct and products that your stakeholders consider to be objectionable.</p> <p>To make this easier, we have made our own policy available under a Creative Commons license that allows others to build upon it however they'd like. Our own policy has never felt like my property, as it has been iteratively refined in collaboration with our clients and was built upon the work that organizations like NBIM had done before us.</p> <p>Our approach is unusual in that it allows me to overrule any of the individual criteria if I see an opportunity for constructive dialogue with the company or another means for the shareholding to manifest positive impact. This gives me substantial flexibility to use the tools at my disposal to drive impact, and avoids making ethical oversight into a box-ticking exercise.</p> <p>You Won't Miss the Stuff You Exclude</p> <p>I've overseen our process for almost three years at this point, and I'm still surprised how little I miss the companies that we've excluded for ethical reasons.</p> <p>There are almost 3,000 issuers on our exclusion list for all manner of conduct and product-related sins. Of those companies, there are only a handful that I would consider sensible investments. The majority are on there for more than one reason. And when we update our exclusions to include new criteria, we often find new and exciting reasons not to miss them.</p> <p>I believe there is an existential link between governance, ethics, and investability. And if you manage to identify that companies have endemic ethics problems, why wouldn't you remove them from your investable universe?</p> <p>Aquiesce to Active</p> <p>Ethical investing is active investment management. It is foolish to pretend otherwise.</p> <p>You can spend a lot of time and effort worrying about how to mean-variance optimize your holdings so that their volatility patterns match those of a broader index, but you'll miss a profound opportunity to recontextualize your investment program in the process. Your required rate of return is likely your ultimate benchmark, so why not use it instead of legacy indices?</p> <p>After all, if you embark on an honest and searching divestment journey, it's likely that your holdings will look a lot different than the S&amp;P 500. And it will be a journey. I wrote an essay reflecting on my own path a few years ago that may be useful.</p> <p>Harness The Energy of your Stakeholders</p> <p>I can't remember a time when young people were this interested in what's happening inside of their University's endowments. If I were working in one of these offices, I would be looking for ways to listen to these folks on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>Why not survey students on a wide range of ethical issues to see where they stand? Or work to identify types of investments that would appeal to these stakeholders?</p> <p>It can't be that hard to hire a facilitator to tease out the things that would be seen as exciting or equitable, and that idea generation work may lead to tangible opportunities.</p> <p>Ask for Help</p> <p>I probably only have the bandwidth to engage in-depth with one investment office on this outside of facilitating access to our flagship strategy. But there are plenty of others out there who could be helpful, and I happen to be friendly with a lot of them.</p> <p>Send us a note if you'd like us to provide some ideas confidentially. But this suggestion goes far beyond anything I, my firm, or our community can do for you.</p> <p>After all, the broad debate about divestment can get heated. But you've risen to the height of our profession, and likely have wise people whose counsel you rely on. As I said above, you'll need to evolve your own response to these student demands. Don't deprive yourself of their counsel.</p> <p>For more of our thoughts on divestment, click here.</p>","tags":["divestment","endowments","ethics","responsible-investing"]},{"location":"blog/2024/05/15/where-should-i-go-to-learn-more-about-managing-my-finances/","title":"Where Should I Go to Learn More about Managing My Finances?","text":"<p>Many of our clients seek a mix of coaching, consulting, and other services related to financial planning that we are not able to provide.</p> <p>In no particular order, here are some resources that may be helpful to clients seeking direct support as they expand their knowledge of finance and investing.</p> <p>Coaching:</p> <ul> <li>YNAB Budget Coaching with Miriam Zoila P\u00e9rez</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Individual Money Coaching with Iris Brilliant</p> </li> <li> <p>Both/And Finance with Rebecca Blumenshine</p> </li> <li> <p>My Money Story</p> </li> <li> <p>Young &amp; Scrappy</p> </li> <li> <p>Finances for Feminists</p> </li> <li> <p>Community Roots Financials</p> </li> </ul> <p>Therapy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Castillo Financial Therapy</p> </li> <li> <p>Healthy Wealthy Roots</p> </li> <li> <p>Find a Financial Therapist</p> </li> </ul> <p>Classes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Take Control of Your Money with River Nice</p> </li> <li> <p>Financial Foundations and Investment Management courses with Rebecca Blumenshine</p> </li> <li> <p>How Busy Women can Invest Like a Boss with Anjali Pradhan</p> </li> </ul> <p>Redistribution of Wealth:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Outstanding Returns</p> </li> <li> <p>Move Money Shift Power</p> </li> <li> <p>Morgan Curtis</p> </li> </ul> <p>Divorce:</p> <ul> <li>Summerhill Firm</li> </ul>","tags":[]},{"location":"blog/2024/05/25/can-i-really-understand-my-entire-portfolio-in-a-sunday-afternoon/","title":"Can I really understand my entire portfolio in a Sunday afternoon?","text":"<p>Yes, and this is one of the most powerful aspects of our approach.

His work as Director of Research at the CFA Institute Research Foundation was a big part of my life in the nine years I spent on staff at CFA Institute.

The costs associated with Larry's plan would be profound, the growth he claims it would unlock may never materialize, and the ethics of putting such a plan forward are immensely problematic.\u00a0</p> <p>Over the following paragraphs, we'll take a deep look at what adapting to climate change actually means.

The authors examined the seventy-five countries eligible for loans and grants from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), which are the poorest countries in the world by definition, and found some disquieting results.</p> <p>The headline is stark: more than half of these countries are growing more slowly than the rich world. And fully one third of them are poorer today than they were at the onset of the COVID pandemic. This is a significant change from the past: We have to look back to the late 1990s in order to find a period where broadly increasing prosperity was this unusual.\u00a0</p> <p>I can't tell you exactly why this is, but here's one contributing factor: over the course of the last thirty years, jobs have reliably been created in lower cost economies as supply chains globalized in search of the most capital-efficient means of production. But after the frailties of this system were laid bare by the global pandemic, global companies began to \"nearshore\" or \"friendshore\" their operations in order to mitigate exposure to future shocks.\u00a0</p> <p>Firm-level benefits aside, further fragmentation of the previous world order is likely to have chilling effects on global economic growth.\u00a0</p> <p>A recent IMF working paper estimates a long-term global GDP loss of 4.5 percent if global economic integration reverts to its level in the year 2000, which was before China joined the World Trade Organization. Almost everyone would be worse off in this scenario, especially if tariffs and other barriers to trade were to be enacted as \"corrective\" measures.\u00a0</p> <p>And regrettably, some degree of such action is likely in the near future. To be clear: I am not predicting this. And I am certainly not rooting for it.\u00a0</p> <p>But the reality is simple: broader, more inclusive global growth is not a foregone conclusion under any circumstances. Trends in global trade patterns that made it seem that way may be reverting just as costly challenges are materializing.</p> <p>Climate change is one of the most significant such challenges. Natural disasters already cost the average IDA country 1.3% of its GDP per year, and that has roughly doubled in recent decades.

Pushing them back... would be the cruelest joke ever played on what Frantz Fanon called \"the wretched of the Earth.\"</p> <p>I would hate to be involved in a cruel joke of any form, so let's embrace the premise that there's a straightforward path to sustained growth in any given country for a second.

So there's a big quote from them coming soon. But because their argument talks a lot about GDP growth, I'll first remind you that Simon Kuznets \u2014 the economist who came up with GDP \u2014 had the following to say about it:</p> <p>GDP 'measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.</p> <p>I hope having that handy makes the next few paragraphs a bit more fun for you:</p> <p>The proportion of the world's GDP spent on energy-in-the-large, including food and animal feed, has decreased by an order of magnitude since the early modern era. A society that spends upwards of 70 percent of its income on food and fodder is poor indeed...</p> <p></p> <p>But energy costs as a share of GDP didn't really fall off a cliff until the rapid industrialization of the nineteenth century, powered by coal and then oil and gas.\u00a0</p> <p>This may be counterintuitive: don't heavy industries use a lot of energy? Yes, but an industrial economy is so much more productive than an agricultural and handcraft economy that the denominator \u2013 world GDP \u2013 grew massively.\u00a0</p> <p>Thus, the energy share fell even as the absolute consumption of energy soared. Interestingly, the energy share of GDP has remained about the same \u2013 around 10 percent \u2013since the early 1900s.\u00a0</p> <p>This is not because energy use remained stable, but because energy use and economic output exploded upward roughly in tandem.</p> <p>It's interesting that Larry and Mark celebrate the role of technological development in producing this output explosion, but neglect to consider it in their analysis of renewable energy technologies. Their case that the energy needed to fuel growth must come from fossil fuels rests on the unstated assumption that renewables technology will not improve.</p> <p>This is ahistorical.\u00a0</p> <p>The cost of building new wind and solar facilities has declined by orders of magnitude over the past twenty years while their efficiency has grown by leaps and bounds. And new battery chemistries are emerging based on plentiful, inexpensive minerals like sodium which may further reshape the energy landscape over coming decades.\u00a0</p> <p>In other words, today's renewable energy technologies may not be able to fulfill global energy demand, but tomorrow's might. </p> <p>The 18th century economist Thomas Malthus used similar logic to argue that the supply of food could not keep pace with the growth of the human population. But new developments in agricultural technology intervened and our planet is now home to roughly eight times as many humans who enjoy a much higher standard of living than those ancestors.\u00a0</p> <p>So as we consider the argument that fossil fuels are the only source capable of meeting our energy needs, let's remember that things have a way of changing. The first patents for solar panels and wind turbines were only granted in the 1880s, and they've since evolved from novelties into economically viable alternatives.\u00a0</p> <p>This is particularly important because the path Larry and Mark propose has significant costs in addition to money. Average temperatures have already risen by .8\u00b0C relative to their average between 1961 and 1990, and it's worth underlining that the order-of-magnitude increases in quality of living as measured by the cost of food and fodder had already materialized by 1900.\u00a0</p> <p>We have cell phones and the internet now, but also PFAS, and \u2014 according to a great report from the Republican side of Congress' Joint Economic Committee \u2014 a level of mortality from deaths of despair like suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease that \"surpasses anything seen in America since the dawn of the 20th century.\"\u00a0</p> <p>There's one thing we never had back then: plastic. </p> <p>That's not particularly interesting at first glance. Production volume in almost everything has grown by leaps and bounds in the postwar period. But there is one particularly pertinent thing to remember about plastics: they're made of oil.\u00a0</p> <p>And demand for them is a huge part of global oil demand. To wit: the International Energy Agency's latest medium-term oil outlook notes that Chinese imports of plastic polymers, synthetic fibers like polyester, and other intermediate petrochemicals produced roughly as much oil demand as the entire country of Germany in 2023.\u00a0</p> <p>The authors expect rising demand for petrochemicals (which, to be fair, is a much broader category than just plastics) to drive roughly three quarters of the increase in global oil demand between now and 2030.\u00a0</p> <p>And that's worth remembering as you read the first sentence of Larry's concluding section, which notes:\u00a0</p> <p>Some would say that it's worth sacrificing almost everything we value in life to \"save the planet.\"</p> <p>When the discussion is framed that way, it's easy to overlook the many tangible steps that can be taken to mitigate the negative effects of fossil fuel consumption.\u00a0</p> <p>I doubt anyone would sign up to live in an unrecognizable world in order to preserve some semblance of normalcy. But that's exactly the world that will result from Larry's proposed path forward: just think about all of the cities with an unearthly future that we've talked about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>By contrast, a future with less plentiful polymers is a lot easier to stomach. Wouldn't you be willing to give up plastic bottles and polyester for a chance at a more sustainable future? Wading into trade-offs like this is at the heart of effective adaptation to climate change, which Larry and I agree is absolutely essential.\u00a0</p> <p>So what does it look like to take that challenge seriously?</p>","tags":["economics","energy-transition","fossil-fuels","renewables"]},{"location":"blog/2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#arise-acolytes-of-adaptation","title":"Arise, Acolytes of Adaptation!","text":"<p>We won't make progress on anything without a cogent and comprehensive definition of the problem we're dealing with.\u00a0</p> <p>When we talk about climate change, we're often referring to a more complex set of changes linked to the consequences of human activity on the surrounding environment.\u00a0</p> <p>A team of researchers has helpfully enumerated each of the nine planetary processes that are essential for maintaining the stability and resilience of the earth as a whole.

If the forest were to be replaced with farmland, there would likely also be increases in biogeochemical flows from the introduction of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers.

The quote below that Larry shares from Mark Mills is undeniably true today:\u00a0</p> <p>The world already digs up an amount of earth equal to 7000 Great Pyramids per year to shift from gas, oil, and coal to the minerals required for the energy transition. These include nickel, cadmium, tellurium, obviously lithium, and cobalt among other minerals. You would have to dig up 50,000 Pyramids' worth of the Earth each year to get [enough of] those minerals [to complete the transition].\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>All of that mining already has drastic consequences for the biosphere. To keep this essay readable, I'll refrain from enumerating all of them.\u00a0</p> <p>But readers rooting for the immediate and wholesale replacement of fossil fuels should be aware that they're advocating for something with profound spillover effects.\u00a0</p> <p>So where does that leave us?\u00a0</p> <p>The messy gray area where progress actually happens. </p> <p>In a perfect world, we could rely on a combination of environmental markets and regulation to accurately price the external costs associated with all human activities.</p> <p>That world sounds nice, but we don't live there.</p> <p>So as we think about how to reduce the harm associated with human activity, we need to resist one size fits all solutions and seek instead to understand the checkerboard of local realities that create the global energy picture. And the reality is that burning oil or natural gas would be a huge improvement in some places, since it would replace dirtier energy sources like coal.\u00a0</p> <p>For as long as the world remains imperfect, it's incumbent upon analysts like me and Larry to embrace the reality that many things can be true at once.

And over the past century, we've allowed those desires to set the economic agenda without much interference.\u00a0</p> <p>None of us can put forward a complete solution to solve the climate crisis while preserving our economic prosperity, and we should acknowledge that at every opportunity. After all, we are in the business of making decisions amid conditions of uncertainty. And people often think that means we know much more than we actually do.\u00a0</p> <p>That's why, as we close this exploration, it feels important to draw attention to the malignant overconfidence with which us finance types can sometimes trod through thorny ethical terrain.\u00a0</p> <p>If we come to believe that we can speak with certitude on behalf of people we have never met about their own best interest, we imperil our ability to serve our social function, weaken our standing as a profession, and diminish ourselves individually in the process.</p> <p>The only thing we can know about the future is that it's coming. The fuel that powers it, the technology that shapes it, and the people we'll share it with are yet to be determined. But it's likely that the world will stay an inherently subtle place no matter what happens, and I hope me and my colleagues at Ethical Capital will be here to help you embrace that nuance.\u00a0</p> <p>[forminator_form id=\"8534\"]</p>","tags":["economics","energy-transition","fossil-fuels","renewables"]},{"location":"blog/2024/07/11/how-can-i-balance-my-own-needs-and-my-desire-to-give-generously/","title":"How can I balance my own needs and my desire to give generously?","text":"<p>When Gabe pulled together some resources to help you on your philanthropic journey, he took care to include the following guidance for folks interested in giving generously at the top of the article:</p> <p>Giving is best understood as a continuous practice, not a one-time check writing extravaganza. The most effective donors tend to view it as something they try to get better at over time, and often develop an intensely personal sense of what matters.</p> <p>In other words, even though it would be amazing to make a huge donation to your favorite organization through great personal sacrifice, it would be much healthier to support them in ways that are sustainable for you.</p> <p>That can include giving non-monetary resources like your time and energy, but also remembering that you're no good to the causes you care about if you don't take care of yourself.</p> <p>Think about what they tell you on airplanes: \"put on your own oxygen mask first before assisting other passengers.\" This is intensely practical! If you help others without thinking about yourself, you stand a very good chance of making things worse overall by putting yourself into a position where you need saving.</p> <p>So what should you do? Here are a couple of steps that might feel productive and impactful apart from volunteering:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Identify the organizations you'd like to support and put them in your will. That way the organizations you care about will get your resources when you're no longer using them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Organize a get-together with a suggested donation to your favorite organization. For bonus points, provide some resources to the folks who attend that help them see why the cause matters to you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spend time amplifying messages from activists and organizations you care about on your social media platforms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide in advance to give a percentage of any extra money you come into to causes you care about, but only if it doesn't put your personal finances in peril.</p> </li> <li> <p>Take steps to be someone that others can rely on in emergency situations by keeping things like naloxone and band-aids handy while you're out moving through the world.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The most important thing to remember is that you're not alone.

Are they heading toward a series of rate cuts?</p> <p>The Federal Reserve is and has always been data-dependent, which means they are responding to the underlying economic reality in an adaptive way. There has been some criticism that they have been a little slow to cut, but I think people need to understand that rate cuts are not something to get excited about. They're a symptom of a weakening economy! So, I expect that if we continue to see signs of developing weakness, we will continue to see cuts, but I would be shocked if they depart from that data-dependent framework.</p> <p>What was your reaction to the Fed's decision to cut rates by 0.50%, higher than the typical 0.25% reduction?</p> <p>I think they did their job. The markets would have rebelled if they didn't get some kind of concerted action and a tangible response to the criticism that the Fed has been behind the curve in the economic cycle. It doesn't really factor into the way that we view companies or the way that we see the world, except that we are grateful to have a prudent central bank that acts in a disciplined way to advance its dual mandate of managing inflation and unemployment.</p> <p>What will a rate cut (or cuts) mean for stock market investors? Any big changes?</p> <p>We've seen a rally in some of the more interest rate-sensitive, lower quality companies that tend to have a lot of debt. But for most long-term investors, it's insane to be predicating investment decisions on reading the tea leaves and trying to see what a couple of guys in Washington are going to do in the near term. The heart of building portfolios is finding fundamental economic needs addressed by good companies and owning them throughout whatever may come. That is not going to change because of an act of the Federal Reserve, no matter what the action.</p> <p>How will the rate cut impact various sectors like housing, loans, and savings?</p> <p>This is where the impact of the Fed's action is really going to be felt. A lot of loans and savings products are floating rate, which means that when interest rates change, so does the yield that savers receive and borrowers pay. I know a lot of households are feeling anxiety right now, and it's hard to imagine that a slightly lower interest payment won't be helpful at the margin.</p> <p>On the saver's side of things, there's likely to be increased concern about how to generate income from capital. But it will remain possible, and it's important to remember that we've been through a period of really low interest rates that lasted for most of my adult life, so we will get through this.</p> <p>On the corporate side of things, a lot of lower-quality companies have effectively gotten a reprieve from the lowering of interest rates. That's because they often carry large amounts of debt, and the reduction in interest rates flows almost directly to their bottom line. I expect that will be a relatively passing phenomenon. I don't consider that to be a way to build durable value.</p> <p>People who are in debt, especially the most indebted folks, are breathing a small sigh of relief for sure.</p> <p>How will the rate cut affect the average American?</p> <p>I'm not sure the rate cut will affect the average American, but the conditions that gave rise to it certainly will. The Fed was pointing to increased risks to the unemployment outlook in their release, and it's hard to imagine that not affecting the average American. The government support during Covid led to household balance sheets that were unusually cash-rich for the United States, and that effect has largely subsided by now. The money has been spent.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, a lot of people are having a hard time getting by. We see that the most indebted folks are really having a tough time. And they're not indebted because of moral failure; they're indebted because it's hard to make ends meet.</p> <p>That creates a precarity that tends to pervade how one sees the world. And so I think at a very deep level, every American has been affected by this underlying reality.</p> <p>Should market investors look for opportunities during a rate cut phase? If so, what stock market opportunities might work for them?</p> <p>Investors should always be looking for opportunities. That's how we keep our portfolios fresh! This is a business where you have to kill your darlings (sell positions you like) sometimes in order to stay disciplined, which means it's important to be continuously looking at what else you could own instead of only focusing on the things that you currently own.</p> <p>We've been finding significant opportunities overseas. A lot of European industrial companies are regarded poorly by international investors, but we find that they are often very high-quality companies trading at compelling valuations with an acute appreciation of their stakeholders' needs. Over the course of the last couple of months, we've been able to upgrade and upgrade and upgrade our Growth portfolio (our flagship long-term investment strategy) to the point where it's trading at a cash flow yield that's more than five times that of our index. Those opportunities are out there!</p> <p>We also manage an income strategy that has had a really excellent couple of months of performance by investing in preferred stocks, pools of loans, and longer-maturity corporate bonds. I expect that approach will continue to pay dividends both figuratively and literally.</p> <p>What about bank savers (CDs and money markets)? What does a rate cut or two mean for them?</p> <p>I generally don't think that long-term investors should be using bank savings products for a couple of reasons. First of all, CDs in the best cases generate rates of return that are not much higher than the inflation we've experienced. It can be riskier, but for people who genuinely are trying to put money away for a longer period of time, I think it's kind of foolish not to get the capital markets involved at least a little bit.</p> <p>I think that's because CDs are basically contracts in which the bank wins no matter what interest rates do. If rates go up, they've locked you in at an existing rate. If rates go down, you don't get any mark-to-market appreciation from the value of your investment. All you get back is your principal instead of interest. Whereas with a bond, if you took out an 8% bond and rates went from 8% to 6%, you would be sitting on a hefty gain if the bond was relatively long-dated.</p> <p>That's not to say bank savings products don't have a purpose, but that purpose is often to serve very specific short and intermediate-term needs, like saving for a down payment on a house or putting money that you're going to spend on tuition somewhere so it gets a little bit of yield before it gets sent out the door. Those are appropriate uses for money market funds and CDs. But I find that many bank savers I meet do not explore these other options, and they really should.</p> <p>Any advice for investors concerned about falling interest rates and the impact on their investment and retirement portfolios?</p> <p>We're going to get through this. There are still ways to generate income. There are still ways to generate capital gains. Those will not change because of interest rates.</p> <p>But with that said, a lot of investors are operating strategies that are really more mismatched collections of tactics than truly well-thought-out investment portfolios. In general, I think fretting a lot about Fed decisions, elections, or anything like that is a symptom of an underdeveloped investment strategy.</p> <p>So anybody who's got these concerns should either call up their advisor and have a conversation or get one, because it's likely that there is a speculative element in their portfolio design that they may not even be conscious of.</p> <p>But I mean, think about it. Interest rates were pretty close to zero for most of my adult life. This moment of real tangible interest rates has been a nice breather. But it's a departure from recent history, and I worry that it may have deceived some investors into thinking that risk-free returns exist. The reality is that they don't. Even if the risks are minimal, they still exist.</p> <p>It can be kind of scary to hear that because it implies that we live in this very flimsy world. But I don't think that's the case. Throughout history, humans have found ways to respond to challenging situations and generate shared value in the process.</p> <p>That basic engine is fundamentally human. It's what's behind all of the investment returns that are generated in your portfolio. That adaptive force is innate to markets, and I think understanding and appreciating it gives us a real sense of their beauty and resilience.</p> <p>How do you think the Fed's recent rate cut will impact inflation, the job market, and GDP growth?</p> <p>I think it will help keep inflation and expectations under control and provide a little bit of support to the job market at the margin. But I don't think it's going to be a material factor in driving GDP growth. That's not the point of Federal Reserve policy. They are trying to minimize inflation and control unemployment, not manage growth. There's a clear interplay between what they do and GDP growth, but it would be concerning if they began to make decisions with an eye towards short-term economic numbers.</p>","tags":["fed","interest-rates","unemployment"]},{"location":"contact/","title":"Ethical Capital Contact","text":"<p>We're here to help you align your investments with your values and answer any questions you may have about our services.</p>"},{"location":"contact/#get-in-touch","title":"Get in Touch","text":"<p>If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us at hello@ethicic.com.</p> <p>Phone: +1 347 625 9000</p> <p>Office Location: 90 N 400 E Provo, UT 84606</p> <p>Hours of Operation: Monday to Friday: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM ET Saturday: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM ET</p>"},{"location":"contact/#schedule-a-meeting","title":"Schedule a Meeting","text":"<p>Ready to talk?
