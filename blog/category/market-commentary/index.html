<h2 id="cutting-interest-rates-wont-change-much"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/09/21/cutting-interest-rates-wont-change-much/">Cutting Interest Rates Won't Change Much</a></h2>
<p>I've gotten a number of questions about interest rates recently, and I assume there are more lingering in the minds of our clients and community that I haven't been asked yet.</p>
<p>So here's what I think in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Fed cut rates because the economy is weakening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It won't change the way we invest or the nature of economic value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our <a href="https://ethicic.com/how-we-invest/impact-income/">income strategy</a> is well suited for these times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think quite a few things, so here is a more extended Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>If it prompts more questions, <a href="https://ethicic.com/form-library/ask-a-question/">send them in</a>!</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What's your take on Federal Reserve interest rate policy right now? Are they heading toward a series of rate cuts?</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is and has always been data-dependent, which means they are responding to the underlying economic reality in an adaptive way. There has been some criticism that they have been a little slow to cut, but I think people need to understand that rate cuts are not something to get excited about. They're a symptom of a weakening economy! So, I expect that if we continue to see signs of developing weakness, we will continue to see cuts, but I would be shocked if they depart from that data-dependent framework.</p>
<p><strong>What was your reaction to the Fed's decision to cut rates by 0.50%, higher than the typical 0.25% reduction?</strong></p>
<p>I think they did their job. The markets would have rebelled if they didn't get some kind of concerted action and a tangible response to the criticism that the Fed has been behind the curve in the economic cycle. It doesn't really factor into the way that we view companies or the way that we see the world, except that we are grateful to have a prudent central bank that acts in a disciplined way to advance its dual mandate of managing inflation and unemployment.</p>
<p><strong>What will a rate cut (or cuts) mean for stock market investors? Any big changes?</strong></p>
<p>We've seen a rally in some of the more interest rate-sensitive, lower quality companies that tend to have a lot of debt. But for most long-term investors, it's insane to be predicating investment decisions on reading the tea leaves and trying to see what a couple of guys in Washington are going to do in the near term. The heart of building portfolios is finding fundamental economic needs addressed by good companies and owning them throughout whatever may come. That is not going to change because of an act of the Federal Reserve, no matter what the action.</p>
<p><strong>How will the rate cut impact various sectors like housing, loans, and savings?</strong></p>
<p>This is where the impact of the Fed's action is really going to be felt. A lot of loans and savings products are floating rate, which means that when interest rates change, so does the yield that savers receive and borrowers pay. I know a lot of households are feeling anxiety right now, and it's hard to imagine that a slightly lower interest payment won't be helpful at the margin.</p>
<p>On the saver's side of things, there's likely to be increased concern about how to generate income from capital. But it will remain possible, and it's important to remember that we've been through a period of really low interest rates that lasted for most of my adult life, so we will get through this.</p>
<p>On the corporate side of things, a lot of lower-quality companies have effectively gotten a reprieve from the lowering of interest rates. That's because they often carry large amounts of debt, and the reduction in interest rates flows almost directly to their bottom line. I expect that will be a relatively passing phenomenon. I don't consider that to be a way to build durable value.</p>
<p>People who are in debt, especially the most indebted folks, are breathing a small sigh of relief for sure.</p>
<p><strong>How will the rate cut affect the average American?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure the rate cut will affect the average American, but the conditions that gave rise to it certainly will. The Fed was pointing to increased risks to the unemployment outlook in their release, and it's hard to imagine that not affecting the average American. The government support during Covid led to household balance sheets that were unusually cash-rich for the United States, and that effect has largely subsided by now. The money has been spent.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, a lot of people are having a hard time getting by. We see that the most indebted folks are really having a tough time. And they're not indebted because of moral failure; they're indebted because it's hard to make ends meet.</p>
<p>That creates a precarity that tends to pervade how one sees the world. And so I think at a very deep level, every American has been affected by this underlying reality.</p>
<p><strong>Should market investors look for opportunities during a rate cut phase? If so, what stock market opportunities might work for them?</strong></p>
<p>Investors should always be looking for opportunities. That's how we keep our portfolios fresh! This is a business where you have to kill your darlings (sell positions you like) sometimes in order to stay disciplined, which means it's important to be continuously looking at what else you could own instead of only focusing on the things that you currently own.</p>
<p>We've been finding significant opportunities overseas. A lot of European industrial companies are regarded poorly by international investors, but we find that they are often very high-quality companies trading at compelling valuations with an acute appreciation of their stakeholders' needs. Over the course of the last couple of months, we've been able to upgrade and upgrade and upgrade our Growth portfolio (our flagship long-term investment strategy) to the point where it's trading at a cash flow yield that's more than five times that of our index. Those opportunities are out there!</p>
<p>We also manage an income strategy that has had a really excellent couple of months of performance by investing in preferred stocks, pools of loans, and longer-maturity corporate bonds. I expect that approach will continue to pay dividends both figuratively and literally.</p>
<p><strong>What about bank savers (CDs and money markets)? What does a rate cut or two mean for them?</strong></p>
<p>I generally don't think that long-term investors should be using bank savings products for a couple of reasons. First of all, CDs in the best cases generate rates of return that are not much higher than the inflation we've experienced. It can be riskier, but for people who genuinely are trying to put money away for a longer period of time, I think it's kind of foolish not to get the capital markets involved at least a little bit.</p>
<p>I think that's because CDs are basically contracts in which the bank wins no matter what interest rates do. If rates go up, they've locked you in at an existing rate. If rates go down, you don't get any mark-to-market appreciation from the value of your investment. All you get back is your principal instead of interest. Whereas with a bond, if you took out an 8% bond and rates went from 8% to 6%, you would be sitting on a hefty gain if the bond was relatively long-dated.</p>
<p>That's not to say bank savings products don't have a purpose, but that purpose is often to serve very specific short and intermediate-term needs, like saving for a down payment on a house or putting money that you're going to spend on tuition somewhere so it gets a little bit of yield before it gets sent out the door. Those are appropriate uses for money market funds and CDs. But I find that many bank savers I meet do not explore these other options, and they really should.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for investors concerned about falling interest rates and the impact on their investment and retirement portfolios?</strong></p>
<p>We're going to get through this. There are still ways to generate income. There are still ways to generate capital gains. Those will not change because of interest rates.</p>
<p>But with that said, a lot of investors are operating strategies that are really more mismatched collections of tactics than truly well-thought-out investment portfolios. In general, I think fretting a lot about Fed decisions, elections, or anything like that is a symptom of an underdeveloped investment strategy.</p>
<p>So anybody who's got these concerns should either call up their advisor and have a conversation or get one, because it's likely that there is a speculative element in their portfolio design that they may not even be conscious of.</p>
<p>But I mean, think about it. Interest rates were pretty close to zero for most of my adult life. This moment of real tangible interest rates has been a nice breather. But it's a departure from recent history, and I worry that it may have deceived some investors into thinking that risk-free returns exist. The reality is that they don't. Even if the risks are minimal, they still exist.</p>
<p>It can be kind of scary to hear that because it implies that we live in this very flimsy world. But I don't think that's the case. Throughout history, humans have found ways to respond to challenging situations and generate shared value in the process.</p>
<p>That basic engine is fundamentally human. It's what's behind all of the investment returns that are generated in your portfolio. That adaptive force is innate to markets, and I think understanding and appreciating it gives us a real sense of their beauty and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think the Fed's recent rate cut will impact inflation, the job market, and GDP growth?</strong></p>
<p>I think it will help keep inflation and expectations under control and provide a little bit of support to the job market at the margin. But I don't think it's going to be a material factor in driving GDP growth. That's not the point of Federal Reserve policy. They are trying to minimize inflation and control unemployment, not manage growth. There's a clear interplay between what they do and GDP growth, but it would be concerning if they began to make decisions with an eye towards short-term economic numbers.</p>

<p>We work hard to identify and invest in companies that generate positive real-world impact in the same way they generate revenue.</p>
<p>This isn't just about feeling good. For one thing, we consider companies with a positive, well-established role in a broader system to be more resilient than their competitors. They tend to be good stewards of their corporate assets, with well-established governance procedures and clear processes to mitigate conflicts with shareholders.</p>
<p>With that said, companies are social organisms with living, breathing components. Which makes it difficult to capture what makes them special with mere statistics. Fortunately, concentration is one of the hallmarks of our investment style. Which means it's possible for us to pull together brief narratives about our holdings which you can read through at your leisure.</p>
<p>This approach differs significantly from the way investment firms typically talk about impact.</p>
<p>The tendency is to produce reports which focus on a handful of issues like climate, waste, and water usage. But unfortunately, this can prevent clients and other stakeholders from developing a holistic view of how the portfolio's holdings interact with the world around them. This conventional approach can also focus your attention on data that is easily comparable and readily available, which overlooks much of the nuance of a deeper analysis.</p>
<p>Our approach has downsides too. It's more unwieldy than a slick infographic, short on portfolio-level statistics, and long on my own exposition. We are always looking to refine and improve our approach to this, so I hope you'll <a href="https://app.precisefp.com/w/ixj9du">share your thoughts</a> with us on how we can do better.</p>
<h3 id="whats-in-this-strategy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#whats-in-this-strategy">What's In This Strategy?</a></h3>
<p>We think of the holdings in our flagship <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">Global Opportunity</a> strategy as belonging to one of four verticals: Infrastructure, Innovation, Lending, and Real Estate.</p>
<p>The criteria for each is relatively straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real Estate companies generate revenue through the sale and rental of real estate,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure holdings generate revenue directly from a fixed physical asset or by selling goods and services to the operators of those assets,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation holdings generate revenue through novel products or business practices, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lending companies generate revenue by charging interest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Relative to our benchmark (The MSCI ACWI), we remain significantly underweight non-us companies at the moment, with roughly 78% of our overall holdings domiciled in the United States.</p>
<p>We are also significantly overweight Real Estate, Industrials, and Financial Services stocks, and have no current positions in the Basic Materials, Energy, Healthcare or Utilities Sectors, which are roughly 22% of our index.</p>
<p>The strategy's historical performance is shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/CleanShot-2024-06-03-at-12.28.22@2x-1-1024x515.png"/></p>
<h3 id="inside-the-verticals"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#inside-the-verticals">Inside the Verticals</a></h3>
<p>Breaking our portfolio down by industry verticals is helpful when analyzing our strategy. The table below shows some summary statistics for each of these four components, as well as their weight within the strategy overall.</p>
<p>Our focus on companies with solid business models that generate free cash flow is immediately evident from this comparison. Our strategy has more than three times the ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of its benchmark, which indicates that our holdings are extremely well-placed to make strategic investments or return capital to shareholders over the coming years.</p>
<p>Trading at roughly 60 times earnings, our Real Estate vertical might seem richly valued at first glance. We believe that current accounting earnings are not the best indicator of value for these asset-based businesses, especially in the midst of structural headwinds for the real estate industry. Our holdings are extremely well-positioned with high occupancy rates, deeply integrated into their local communities, and have been weathering the industry's recent stresses with aplomb.</p>
<p>We continue to see opportunity in each of our verticals, and our due diligence pipeline is full of high-impact lenders, innovative companies with misunderstood opportunity sets, and infrastructure investments that should benefit from significant secular tailwinds.</p>

<h3 id="top-5-holdings"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#top-5-holdings">Top 5 Holdings</a></h3>
<p>The following five companies were the largest positions. These five positions comprised 42% of our overall holdings in this strategy as of June 3rd, 2024.</p>
<h4 id="agricultural-mortgage-corporation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#agricultural-mortgage-corporation">Agricultural Mortgage Corporation</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Lending</p>
<p>Known as Farmer Mac, this Washington D.C. based lender is a remarkable example of impact in action. Its core purpose is to increase the availability of long-term credit at stable interest rates for America's rural communities.</p>
<p>The company estimates that farmers and ranchers invest $2 locally for every dollar they save on interest expenses, which means the company's impact reaches deep into areas of the country that are just plain difficult to access.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the company is focused on growing its portfolio of loans to rural electricity cooperatives, which is a profound opportunity to compound their impact over time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Farmer Mac's core financial equation is a thing of beauty. They have delivered consistent returns on equity in the high teens, and more than 90% of their revenue is recurring. On top of that, the company is well placed to serve growth markets in renewable energy, fund investments that will be necessary to increase agricultural sustainability and productivity, and deepen the resilience of our agricultural system.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="alexandria-real-estate"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#alexandria-real-estate">Alexandria Real Estate</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Real Estate</p>
<p>This Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is focused on creating and maintaining the mission-critical lab space that innovative biotechnology companies require to develop life-changing therapies.</p>
<p>It was the first REIT to adopt this focus, and roughly three-quarters of its annual revenue comes from "clusters" of market-leading lab space in key centers of pharmaceutical R&amp;D like Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, and North Carolina's Research Triangle.</p>
<p>The company's tenants were responsible for 50% of novel FDA-approved therapies in the ten years ending 2023, which is nothing if not profound impact. And to our nerdy delight, the company has won numerous awards for the quality of its disclosures and financial reports in that period as well.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-2-1024x336.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Office real estate is in the doldrums at the moment, but lab space is uniquely insulated from the industry's high-level challenges because the work that happens inside of them can't generally be done from home. The company's revenues and cash flows are growing at healthy double-digit margins, but we have been able to purchase stock at valuations unseen since the financial crisis while other investors have been fleeing the industry.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="duolingo"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#duolingo">Duolingo</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>Duolingo's mission is to provide a private tutor experience to everyone on the planet through technology. Initially focused on just language learning, they have expanded their focus to include math and music in recent years.</p>
<p>Each of these areas unlocks significant economic opportunity for the learners that participate in them. Learning a new language is arguably the single most effective way to enable an individual to improve their economic situation since communication is necessary for most forms of high value work.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the company has used its power in the language learning market to introduce a new, lower cost, and more accessible language assessment test which is displacing the legacy Test of English as a Foreign Language, or TOEFL, which is a profound additional benefit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-6-1024x576.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Duolingo is a longstanding market leader in commercializing AI for public benefit, but it has recently come under assault from short sellers after supposedly competing translation products were unveiled by OpenAI and others. We think the threats are overblown: the company's learning system is extremely difficult to replicate, has significant growth opportunities ahead of it, and has been consistently growing revenues at more than 40% a year.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="lemonade"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#lemonade">Lemonade</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>Lemonade is a public benefit corporation organized "to harness novel business models, technologies, and private-nonprofiit partnerships to deliver insurance products where charitable giving is a core feature."</p>
<p>That alone is profoundly innovative. But the company's management team has been incredibly creative in the way that they fund their growth plans, which adds another layer of wonderfulness to an already-exciting proposition.</p>
<p>The company's insurance products have industry-leading net promoter scores around 70, and operate closer to breakeven than most insurance industry analysts tend to recognize. As their core demographic ages, we expect they will come back to Lemonade again and again.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/122-1225602_image-lemonade-insurance-logo-hd-png-download.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Lemonade is well capitalized with narrowing operating losses and annual revenue growth in excess of 40%. The next two years of growth should have remarkable implications for its bottom line as the company expands past breakeven, and we were able to buy in at a fifth of their IPO price.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="crocs"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#crocs">Crocs</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>This manufacturer of comfy clogs has been dismissed as a fad every year since they IPO'd back in 2006. But a look past the surface reveals an immensely innovative company that has consistently iterated on their core design to create something that is somehow both trendy and timeless.</p>
<p>The company is also well on the way towards replacing the plastic in its shoes with renewable materials, and aims to reach 50% bio-based materials by 2030. They have also rolled out a recycling program that offers discounts on new shoes to those who participate.</p>
<p>On its own, that's not so impressive. But the company has made huge strides towards enshrining comfort and utility in our popular culture, which is a significant form of impact on its own.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-9-1024x687.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> The company took on a significant debt load after acquiring Heydude, a complementary footwear brand, in 2022. Though concerning, this hasn't hurt the company's solid global growth trajectory, with both brands exceeding estimates as of the most recent report. As they pay down debt and continue on their growth trajectory, we expect free cash flow to continue growing by 25% or more over the coming years.</p>

<p>This outcry was long overdue.</p>
<p>And not just because the killing of Palestinian civilians is harrowing and wrong.</p>
<p>As the person in charge of designing and implementing some of the investment industry's <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/screening/">most stringent ethical guidelines</a>, I can say with some authority that the world's capital markets are full of ethical catastrophes that defy easy comprehension.</p>
<p>In other words, it would be something else if not Palestine.</p>
<p>And it will be something else after Palestine.</p>
<p>Your investment staff probably are not yet equipped to adjudicate the many complexities that come with managing money morally. But your student stakeholders are calling out for clearer moral lines about what their endowment stands to profit from.</p>
<p>I don't have to tell you that we've been down this road before. With fossil fuels and for-profit prisons, tobacco companies, and plenty more. And this time around, I am urging you: <strong>take the students seriously, not just literally</strong>.</p>
<p>The operational challenges of managing a modern endowment portfolio necessitate long-term planning. You've got to pace the maturation of your holdings to coincide with spending plans, produce a steady stream of consistent quality opportunities to match with incoming cash, and manage the complex communications associated with your own oversight.</p>
<p>I suggest you situate this entire discussion within that oversight process. The most effective way to take the students seriously is to build a moral oversight process and reporting framework that passes their muster. With such a thing in place, you will be able to make genuine long-term commitments without worrying about subsequent challenges from stakeholders.</p>
<p>There isn't one right way to build something like that: you will need to build and refine your own approach.</p>
<p>But we've learned a few things over the past few years that might be helpful to other long-term investors thinking about how to merge a little more morality into the way they do money management.</p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions that may be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Even if they've been operating under an ESG policy for years, deeply integrating ethical criteria into investment decision making will be new for most investment offices.</p>
<p>So was crypto. But unlike the blockchain stuff, building competency here is all but guaranteed to pay dividends for your organization. Think about it: this will not be the last moral issue you have to contend with. As you prune and populate your portfolio, wouldn't it be nice to have a handle on things that may impede your ability to act as a true long-term investor?</p>
<p>If you are thoughtful, earnest, and perhaps lucky, you will find a way to engage with your stakeholders that becomes a source of positive idiosyncrasy. That's a big part of what makes this firm special: our clients know that I want to hear about their moral concerns ASAP. As a result, we've got our ear to the ground in ways that would be difficult to replicate for folks who are just feigning interest.</p>
<p><strong>Make a Living List</strong></p>
<p>You will want a living document that describes the conduct and products that your stakeholders consider to be objectionable.</p>
<p>To make this easier, we have made our own <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/screening/">policy</a> available under a Creative Commons license that allows others to build upon it however they'd like. Our own policy has never felt like my property, as it has been iteratively refined in collaboration with our clients and was built upon the work that organizations like <a href="https://www.nbim.no/en/responsible-investment/ethical-exclusions/">NBIM</a> had done before us.</p>
<p>Our approach is unusual in that it allows me to overrule any of the individual criteria if I see an opportunity for constructive dialogue with the company or another means for the shareholding to manifest positive impact. This gives me substantial flexibility to use the tools at my disposal to drive impact, and avoids making ethical oversight into a box-ticking exercise.</p>
<p><strong>You Won't Miss the Stuff You Exclude</strong></p>
<p>I've overseen <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">our process</a> for almost three years at this point, and I'm still surprised how little I miss the companies that we've excluded for ethical reasons.</p>
<p>There are almost 3,000 issuers on our exclusion list for all manner of conduct and product-related sins. Of those companies, there are only a handful that I would consider sensible investments. The majority are on there for more than one reason. And when we update our exclusions to include new criteria, we often find new and exciting reasons not to miss them.</p>
<p>I believe there is an existential link between governance, ethics, and investability. And if you manage to identify that companies have endemic ethics problems, why <em>wouldn't</em> you remove them from your investable universe?</p>
<p><strong>Aquiesce to Active</strong></p>
<p>Ethical investing is active investment management. It is foolish to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>You can spend a lot of time and effort worrying about how to mean-variance optimize your holdings so that their volatility patterns match those of a broader index, but you'll miss a profound opportunity to recontextualize your investment program in the process. Your required rate of return is likely your ultimate benchmark, so why not use it instead of legacy indices?</p>
<p>After all, if you embark on an honest and searching divestment journey, it's likely that your holdings will look a lot different than the S&amp;P 500. And it will be a journey. I wrote <a href="https://ethicic.com/how-i-became-an-active-manager/">an essay</a> reflecting on my own path a few years ago that may be useful.</p>
<p><strong>Harness The Energy of your Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>I can't remember a time when young people were this interested in what's happening inside of their University's endowments. If I were working in one of these offices, I would be looking for ways to listen to these folks on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Why not survey students on a wide range of ethical issues to see where they stand? Or work to identify types of investments that would appeal to these stakeholders?</p>
<p>It can't be that hard to hire a facilitator to tease out the things that would be seen as exciting or equitable, and that idea generation work may lead to tangible opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Ask for Help</strong></p>
<p>I probably only have the bandwidth to engage in-depth with one investment office on this outside of facilitating access to our <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">flagship strategy</a>. But there are plenty of others out there who could be helpful, and I happen to be friendly with a lot of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.precisefp.com/w/ixj9du">Send us a note</a> if you'd like us to provide some ideas confidentially. But this suggestion goes far beyond anything I, my firm, or our community can do for you.</p>
<p>After all, the broad debate about divestment can get heated. But you've risen to the height of our profession, and likely have wise people whose counsel you rely on. As I said above, you'll need to evolve your own response to these student demands. Don't deprive yourself of their counsel.</p>

<p>If you ever stroll by my family's booth at the Elephant's Trunk Flea Market in New Milford, Connecticut, you'll be greeted by an uncommon sight for this day and age: several folding tables packed with rows and rows of antique dolls.</p>
<p>Some are propped up individually on fragile wire stands, while others are set down and sprawled about in groups.</p>
<p>Some are in mint condition, while others are far from whole (missing original eye(s), arm(s), hair, etc.).</p>
<p>To most modern eyes, these once-treasured toys are nothing short of nightmare fuel.</p>
<p>I mean:</p>

More to come later...but this piece is tagged a whopping $325.

</figure>
</figure>
<p>That said, the dolls also induce a strong sense of nostalgia for those who played with them in the past. And this means that there's a fairly strong cohort of collectors who find them irresistible.</p>
<p>I'm not in this position by choice: my maternal grandparents were part of this passionate group, and when they left this world their amalgamation of oddities was bestowed upon my parents.</p>
<p>Now, we are faced with the daunting task of sorting through it all and finding new homes for each item. We've moved three times to this day, and the stuff has come with us each time — not in the back of a moving truck, but in piecemeal trips made by my father and I.</p>
<p>Though each doll does not need its own seatbelt, these trips have always been taken with preservation in mind.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how much we actually have, the entire inventory takes up about 2,000 square feet in the form of doll districts that proliferate in the garages, sheds, barns, nooks, and crannies of our life.</p>

"Oops." - My face when I forget to upload monthly performance stats to our site.

</figure>
<p>We do occasionally indulge in "getting high on our own supply" - scooping up an antique for our own personal use if it so happens to charm us. These acquisitions — alongside some free history lessons — are my favorite features of this strange business.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-contact-with-markets-and-valuation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#my-first-contact-with-markets-and-valuation"><strong>My First Contact with Markets and Valuation</strong></a></h3>
<p>I was once a pre-teen tagalong while my parents who frequented these flea markets and doll shows. And back then, the pricing behind antiques was more or less a mystery.</p>
<p>I thought that old was equivalent to expensive, so to me this stuff was essentially gold.</p>
<p>I'd watch dolls, toys, and dollars exchange hands quicker than the cryptocoins were selling off when FTX collapsed.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today: an environment in which making a sale is <em>much</em> more difficult, and as mentioned earlier, one where most folks will take a look at our wares, mumble something along the lines of "ha, creepy" and simply shuffle along to the next booth.</p>
<p>In the event that we do find ourselves in a position to sell a doll, there's an obvious question: what's it worth?</p>
<p>And it's tricky, to say the least.</p>
<p>Because dolls are not securities. They have no future cash flows for us to discount. They're just art, which means their value is strictly a function of what people are willing to pay.</p>
<p>The preface to <em>Expectations Investing</em> — which Sloane put on my desk as part of my training — discusses how investing differs from art collecting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why is one painting worth millions of dollars and another worth a few hundred?" Bernstein asks. Even in a book as prescriptive as <em>Expectations</em> <em>Investing</em>, we learn that "No calculations can answer that question; the owner merely hopes that another art collector will step up to justify today's selling price at some point in the future." So is it all just up in the air?</p>
<p>Peter Bernstein, Preface to Expectations Investing, P. XII</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, an antique Bebe Jumeau French doll sits up for bid on eBay at just $31. Simultaneously, an antique Tete Jumeau French doll in better-off shape is priced at a whopping $5,400.</p>
<p>That's quite a difference between the two, and I wonder if anyone will ever pay that $5,400.</p>
<p>Though condition (i.e the extent to which a doll shows its age) is an important factor in valuation, and can often explain stark differences in price like the example above, there are several other considerations which should not be disregarded.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scarcity,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provenance,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venue,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance or "book" value,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the collector profile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Careful study of these won't produce a formula for valuing dolls or any other antique for that matter.</p>
<p>Instead, they offer an x-ray of my brain activity and the item-specific idiosyncrasies that are effectively summarized into the price of each doll.</p>
<p>This shows how convoluted the valuation of <em>anything</em> can really be.</p>
<p>I've been in plenty of situations where a "top-tier" doll, according to historical pricing and the framework I used, should have sold for exponentially higher than it actually did. These same considerations apply to any antique, and often influence the price of other assets (including stocks).</p>
<p>Let's examine each of them in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="condition-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#condition-of-the-antique"><strong>Condition</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>Condition is a function of many factors: storage method, being played with or displayed throughout the years, original material, and of course, age.</p>
<p>Storage method and original material sometimes go hand in hand: for example, a bisque doll like the French ones described earlier are best stored facedown if they have glass eyes. Fluorescent lights also turn dolls green, which obviously damages and devalues them.</p>
<p>The original material can also create vast deviations in condition, value, and price.</p>
<p>For example, French and German dolls of the early 1800s were made of papier-mâché. Untinted Bisque, a delicate and more adult-oriented material came about later, and tends to increase value today. These untinted pieces were made with the intention of being objets d'art, and can possess extraordinary details.</p>
<p>Both materials are quite fragile and volatile, but unique in their own ways.</p>
<p>Any doll from the 1800s, unless preserved by a line of meticulous folks who never took it out for a tea party would likely be in worse condition today than a 20th century reproduction.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, collectors prefer their pieces to be as close to mint condition as possible. The newer it looks, the more you can typically try to ask.</p>
<p>However, there are always exceptions - one gentleman comes to our table looking for parts he can use in rehabbing disheveled dollies. We call him the "arm guy".</p>
<figure>

This doll's chipped eyes either speak of all the fun it once had or the neglect it suffered. But they also bring its financial value down quite a bit.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="scarcity-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#scarcity-of-the-antique"><strong>Scarcity</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the second easiest concept to understand is that of scarcity.</p>
<p>There aren't many antique dolls which were produced with the intention of being "rare" today. However, a variety of factors can surround a doll with an authentic (or synthetic) sense of scarcity.</p>
<p>The first step in establishing this is to identify the antique. There is usually a maker's mark or other identifiers on the tags if clothing is present. Once proper identification is accomplished, the internet is your most valuable resource in determining whether or not an antique is scarce.</p>
<p>Some key questions you should ask yourself include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When was the last time a comparable doll was sold online? What price did it realize?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any other examples for sale today?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have I browsed/engaged with various forums and/or contacted my network to see if this is a sought-after or scarce piece?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list could go on and on, but hopefully these spark some ideas - at risk of seeming repetitive, this certainly isn't a science.</p>
<h3 id="provenance-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#provenance-of-the-antique"><strong>Provenance</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>The chronology of ownership, or provenance, of an item can offer great transparency into it's origin, authenticity, and even its scarcity.</p>
<p>Isn't it interesting how the different considerations keep overlapping?</p>
<p>A doll with a detailed, documented provenance will typically fetch a higher price than a doll without. However, like in any form of art, forgeries can and do exist. I've never come across a fake, but have heard stories of them existing (and fooling unsuspecting collectors).</p>
<p>A counterfeit or fake is not to be confused with a reproduction, which was created to resemble its older counterpart but not fool anyone into thinking it <em>is</em> truly older.</p>
<p>In my experience, reproductions have somewhat "flooded" the market and had a negative impact on the value of true antiques. Folks have also knowingly and unknowingly passed off reproductions as originals.</p>
<h3 id="venue-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#venue-of-the-antique"><strong>Venue</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>There are an overwhelming amount of avenues where one can sell these, including flea markets, true "doll shows", eBay, and word of mouth. The last two are not concrete physical venues, but interestingly enough account for a large share of sales volume.</p>
<p>The concept of venue and how it relates to valuation can be usefully simplified: one would likely have an easier time selling umbrellas at a sunny beach than on a ski slope.</p>
<p>The same can be said in this business. Doll shows tend to garner higher demand than a standard flea market - which subsequently allows asking prices to come in higher at the former. But they come with higher costs for dealers like us, and offer no guarantee of a great day of sales.</p>
<p>There's no hard and fast rule when it comes to venue, though, and we've been able to get rid of some high profile ($500+) dolls after meeting a dedicated collector through another client. High profile collectors will often show up at standard flea markets too.</p>
<h3 id="insurancebook-value-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#insurancebook-value-of-the-antique"><strong>Insurance/Book Value</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>The 16th Blue Book of Dolls (we actually lost our copy) is a prime example of a source that provides uniform <em>guidance</em> from a market expert(s) on insurance or "book" value.</p>
<p>This metric can also be thought of as the "replacement cost" of a doll.</p>
<p>However, in 2020, one reviewer said the Book was "a little outdated for true values". To further this point, another reviewer from 2013 said that "Due to ongoing fluctuations in realized online auction prices, the Blue Book values are no longer firm, but still serve as general guides for comparative pricing."</p>
<figure>

![](images/IMG_0644-1024x683.jpg)

<figcaption>

This is a great example of _very_ outdated pricing. I'd feel like a grifter if I got $325 for a doll missing all of their limbs and outfit, and I'd be shocked if a piece like this could be sold for $100 in today's market.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's also important to emphasize again that the Blue Book (or any other similar source) can say one thing about price, but as art, value innately stems from what the next purchaser/collector is willing to pay.</p>
<p>The key phrase here is "realized price." Blue Book can only indicate value, not determine it.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, this is also true of prices in the stock market. When we have our monthly rebalance meetings, Sloane often says that we must respect market movements, but also resist allowing them to define our understanding of a security's true value.</p>
<h3 id="the-antiques-collector-profile"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#the-antiques-collector-profile"><strong>The Antique's Collector Profile</strong></a></h3>
<p>The Collector Profile is my own concept that has had a profound impact on my valuation of dolls.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I haven't discussed the plain old concept of demand yet (which is super clever of you), and I'll explain why.</p>
<p>I believe that in valuing dolls, demand is just one component that makes up the entire collector profile. It is an important consideration, but does not outweigh the concept as a whole.</p>
<p>Let us consider a "perfect storm" scenario: a collector plans to attend a show in advance, and they budget several thousand dollars for the show. They end up finding their "grail" doll, which also happens to be in mint condition - I'd have a tough time believing that the seller of this hypothetical antique wouldn't be able to fetch a relatively high price.</p>
<p>But this collector profile would be a poor match if the same seller was looking to liquidate a box of spare arms and eyes. They'd be better off looking for a horror film prop director or creepy decoration aficionado. Or maybe even Arm Guy.</p>
<p>While the collector profile applies to individuals, it applies to the doll-market on a broader scale: if a unique collector profile doesn't exist for the specific doll in question, that piece will NEVER attain its true maximum value.</p>
<p>Further, someone with a desire to purchase it may <em>never</em> come along. It could sit in the Ahmed doll depot indefinitely, effectively worthless even to our cats.</p>
<p>It's a very real concern in today's market, since nostalgic elders — the key drivers of past market activity — are starting to move on.</p>
<p>Will a new pool of buyers ever come in and take their place?</p>
<p><strong>Some Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Assets come in all shapes and sizes, and so do the considerations that affect their value. And if no one actually comes along with a desire to <em>own</em> the asset, does it have any worth at all?</p>
<p>Over the coming years, I'm fairly certain that one of our clients will find themselves in possession of other obscure antiques. They might even be weird dolls, in which case this article will be particularly salient. If you find yourself in a position where you wish to sell them, I hope this series of considerations provides a starting point to do so.</p>
<p>If not, I hope the "x-ray of my brain when valuing a doll" goes to demonstrate just how intricate the difference between price and value really is.</p>
<p>As always, drop a line if you want to chat about dolls, stocks, or life! We love to hear from you.</p>

<h2 id="the-climate-conundrum"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/10/27/the-climate-conundrum/">The Climate Conundrum</a></h2>
<p>Here's a grim reality: <strong>we were born on a dying planet</strong>.</p>
<p>This has probably occurred to you before, though perhaps not in those exact words. In fact, I'm willing to wager that an awareness of this reality is a huge part of what motivated you to get on our email list in the first place.</p>
<p>So what can we do with this awareness? Here are three distinct steps I want you to take in roughly descending order of priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hold time and space to cope</strong>: Each and every one of us is a marvelous creature, but despite our many magnificences it bears mentioning that we didn't evolve to deal with this unprecedented reality. It's OK not to be OK while considering the impact of things that are outside our control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Figure out who you trust</strong>: Don't rush this. To gain a coherent sense of what's actually happening on this planet, one needs to spend time with copious amounts of information. You can either do this yourself (not advisable) or get involved with organizations like mine which are openly committed to advocating for a just transition and interested in helping you understand what that means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn how to ask for help</strong>: I consider this to be my largest personal growth opportunity. The world I grew up in taught me to be prepared at all times, minimize what I need from others, and never show weakness. But that's silly and even a bit unrealistic. Complex problems get solved through community engagement, not the work of lone geniuses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your mileage may vary, but I've found that each of these three steps has been profoundly useful to me on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Even just creating the understanding that coping is important has paid profound dividends for me over the years. And it's helped me to be radically present for others in times of stress or conflict, which i find tremendously rewarding.</p>
<p>After all, the core of my job is to be deeply aware of these and other realities, understand their practical implications, and make sure your investment portfolio reflects our latest, best, and most holistic understanding of what to do about all of it.</p>
