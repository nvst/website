<h2 id="how-we-measure-investment-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/05/08/how-we-measure-investment-performance/">How We Measure Investment Performance</a></h2>
<p>When I started this firm, I used an external vendor (YCharts) to measure the performance of our investment strategies. This worked well for us at the beginning, but as the firm has grown, it became clear that this was sub-optimal.</p>
<p>I had to perform numerous manual data transfer operations each month in order to produce our performance numbers. And with each passing month, I became more and more concerned that these operations were introducing errors into our reported results.</p>
<p>This isn't so relevant for our existing clients. They have always had access to accurate, up-to-date performance information calculated by Altruist, our custodian.</p>
<p>But it's important to me (and our regulators) that prospective clients have access to accurate, timely information about our investment strategies. So as of today, I'm making a material change to the way we measure and present our investment performance.</p>
<p>Please note that this change is only applicable to the <a href="https://investvegan.org/strategies/">performance we show publicly</a> for each of our strategies. If you're a client, the most accurate performance information will always be available to you directly through the Altruist web portal or app.</p>
<p><strong>What's changing?</strong></p>
<p>Each of our strategy pages now shows the performance for an actual fee-paying account that has been invested in that strategy since its inception instead of a calculated value.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you making this change now?</strong></p>
<p>Our recent hire has allowed me to spend additional time auditing our internal processes. I identified a deficiency in our existing approach and moved to correct it.</p>
<p><strong>How significant is this change?</strong></p>
<p>It's significant. We are discontinuing the practice of reporting on our real estate strategy, and restating the historical performance of our other two strategies.</p>
<p>The table below shows the cumulative performance of our Veda Ethical Growth strategy calculated under the new methodology and the old methodology from October 2021 through March 2023, when the old methodology was discontinued for this strategy. Both the new and old calculations include all applicable fees.</p>

<p>The change also applies to the Veda Integral portfolio. Please note that this table covers a different time period than the one above. I've included returns from the benchmark in these periods in the hopes that it better calibrates your understanding.</p>

</figure>
<p>I would not presume to decide whether this change is significant on your behalf. Instead, I've presented the old and new calculations for each month of each strategy at the end of this post. And like, created a whole blog post about it so that you can dig into the reasoning, examine the practical implications, and decide whether or not to move on with your life.</p>
<p><strong>Will the way investment performance is calculated change again?</strong></p>
<p>Over time, I hope to converge the approach we use with the <a href="https://www.gipsstandards.org/">Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)</a> promulgated by CFA Institute. Attentive readers will remember that I used to work at that organization, and can probably imagine that I continue to hold its standards in high regard.</p>
<p>If I see an opportunity for us to move towards compliance with these standards without compromising our ability to accept clients with no investment minimum, I will seize it. However, in the meantime I have attempted to strike a practical balance between complexity, accuracy, and timeliness.</p>
<p><strong>I've got questions about this. What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>We might be in the midst of a recession right now.</p>
<p>I say that because measures of real-time economic activity have slumped significantly this year. As I write, the Atlanta Fed's <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow">GDPNow model</a> is forecasting that the United States' GDP fell by 2.1 percent.</p>
<p>We can't know for sure if this will come to pass until the official data is released later this summer, but people are already worried about it. Google <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=recession">search volume for the word "recession"</a> is already higher than it was in 2008, and the mainstream press is starting to write about slowing economic activity with some regularity.</p>
<p>It's natural to wonder what this means. After all, most people assume that a recession is one of the most significant risks to their savings. There is certainly truth to that. The S&amp;P 500 is down almost 20% so far this year, and it's likely that many investors have experienced similar declines in the value of their holdings.</p>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>No-one can say with certainty how the rest of the year will unfold. But this is a profound opportunity to learn from history because this isn't the first time that the US economy has slowed down. The National Bureau of Economic Research maintains a handy <a href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating">database</a> of prior instances and we spent some time examining it for indications of how the future might unfold.</p>
<p>One crucial thing to understand is that no-one rings a bell at the onset of a recession. They are generally only recognized in retrospect, when economists can confidently identify peaks and troughs in economic activity.</p>
<p>The chart below is meant to illustrate one of the most important practical implications of this: <strong>by the time an official recession determination is announced, the recession is usually over</strong>. The grey bars indicate recessionary periods and the purple bars indicate when those recessions were announced.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/CleanShot-2024-05-23-at-17.37.14.png"/></p>
<p>Buying stocks during the month a recession was announced generated an average return of 16.19% one year later.</p>
<p>But much more importantly, remaining committed to one's long-term plan allowed investors to experience the profound growth that unfolded over the subsequent decades. Even terrifying periods like 2008's great recession were no match for patience and the power of compounding.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on what matters</strong></p>
<p>The real risk of a recession is that it will scare us into making suboptimal financial choices like staying away from the stock market, selling our existing holdings, and buying expensive "protection" from further market declines.</p>
<p>These mistakes can be immensely seductive! I've got no doubt that there is someone making slick tiktok videos right now about complex trading strategies that purport to preserve the value of portfolios no matter what happens in the market. Your best bet is to ignore these, because they have a way of shifting focus away from what matters: your long-term investment objectives.</p>
<p>Families, individuals, and institutions often forget that the simple act of centering these goals produces a profound sense of strategic clarity. In many cases, the money we manage is meant to meet goals that won't materialize for more than thirty years.</p>
<p>That's roughly the entire amount of time shown in the chart above! It can be hard to picture yourself that far into the future, but it's worth a try. Because by then, you'll have almost no recollection of today's fears, just a sense of gratitude to your past self for sticking with the plan.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/">Why We Need A New Food System Now</a></h2>
<p>Today's supply chain snafus might be setting the stage for a broader, more complex catastrophe in the global food system. The availability of potash, phosphate, and fossil fuel derived agricultural inputs that we rely upon to feed earth's growing populations has already been materially reduced, and these stresses could take as long as 3-5 years to resolve.</p>
<p>The timeline comes from to <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterZeihan">Peter Zeihan</a>, an analyst I've been following for close to a decade for his sharp views on geopolitics, energy, and international trade. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeihanonGeopolitics">His YouTube channel</a> is free, and has been illuminating during Russia's recent war of aggression, so I took the opportunity to dig a little deeper into how his views intersect with something that should be of interest to everyone on the planet: our food system.</p>
<p>He would probably want me to underscore one point at the outset of this exploration: <strong>modern agriculture is an industrial process</strong>. It's true that regenerative approaches are growing in popularity, but at the moment only about 5.5 million of the United States' roughly 900 million acres of farmland is certified organic. That's well under one percent.</p>
<p>So as a practical matter, synthetic fertilizers are currently supporting about half of the world's population.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the world population that our current food system can support with and without synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Approximately half of the people on earth rely on unsustainable synthetic fertilizers to survive. " src="images/world-population-with-and-without-fertilizer-1024x723.png"/></p>
<p>The chart above is stark enough before we pause to consider that supply chain disruptions (and the most acute threats to food security) are not evenly distributed around the world.</p>
<p>North America is unique in that we have plentiful sources of potash, phosphate, and natural gas in close proximity to our midwestern "breadbasket." Only a few other places in the world are so fortunate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eighty percent of global potash production comes from Canada, China, Belarus, or Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China, Morocco, and the United States produce two thirds of the world's phosphate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Russia and the United States are the world's two largest producers of natural gas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed that Russia featured twice in that list. Both Mr. Putin's Petrostate and allied Belarus are now subject to sanctions, which effectively takes a non-trivial portion of the market offline.</p>
<p>It's too soon to tell what this will mean exactly, but just a few days ago the Interim Chief Executive of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/canadas-nutrien-sees-possible-prolonged-global-fertilizer-disruption-russia-2022-03-01/">Nutrien, the world's biggest fertilizer producer, said</a> "We are going to run our plants. Run them flat out. Could we see interruptions in exports out of Russia? Yes. Can we see plant closures? We could."</p>
<p>Such a disruption would be poorly timed, since the northern hemisphere's temperate agricultural regions will be in the full bloom of spring before too long. And fertilizer only works if you put it on the plants before they grow. So in the short term we're left hoping that these shipments can make it to their destinations.</p>
<h5 id="the-food-system-is-unsustainable-at-best"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/#the-food-system-is-unsustainable-at-best">The Food System is Unsustainable at Best</a></h5>
<p>Of course, it bears mentioning that <strong>none of this is remotely sustainable</strong>.</p>
<p>For one thing, potash, phosphate, and fossil fuels are not renewable. They need to be extracted, transported, refined, and then transported again to reach their final destinations.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, they also have an unfortunate tendency to leach into groundwater and literally strangle waterways with out-of-control algal blooms. But even if those negative effects could be contained, farmers would still need to keep spending substantial sums re-applying these treatments every year. And their soil wouldn't be any better off after all of the expense and complexity involved.</p>
<p>Farmers will do their best to adapt. Some might stop planting corn in favor of soy, which needs less fertilizer to grow than conventional cultivation methods. They might even take steps towards adopting regenerative practices by using manure in place of expensive fertilizers.</p>
<p>But that won't help the folks in the global south who are already facing food insecurity.</p>
<p><img alt="Inequality in per capita calorie intake in 2020 by country. This shows that the global south is profoundly more exposed to disruptions in food supply than the rich world. " src="images/coefficient-of-variation-cv-in-per-capita-caloric-intake-1-1024x723.png"/></p>
<p>It's hard to pinpoint where on the planet these pressures will manifest, but one can safely and sadly assume that the darkest-tinted countries in the map above are set to carry most of the weight.</p>
<p>This is a policy choice. And delaying our adaptation leaves many vulnerable populations around the world needlessly exposed to famine.</p>
<p>Even if we were to forget how to make synthetic fertilizer, we could still adapt our agricultural system to feed everybody on earth and entirely mitigate the risk of famine by phasing out animal agriculture. This <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets">would free up 75-400% of the land currently in agricultural use</a> (depending on the way you measure), substantially reduce humanity's carbon footprint, and prevent billions of living, thinking creatures from experiencing needless suffering.</p>
<p>It would also create a much more resilient economy, since we wouldn't have to worry about geopolitical tensions spilling over into famine with the same sort of urgency. The expensive, complicated, and non-renewable inputs that are pushing us towards that extreme situation this time around would be replaced by manure and compost, which can be generated locally.</p>
<h5 id="can-we-accelerate-this-transition"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/#can-we-accelerate-this-transition">Can We Accelerate This Transition?</a></h5>
<p>We can sure try. But it will be a complex undertaking, and it's important to make sure that you've given yourself the space and support to take on this kind of challenge. True change starts from within, so this can be as simple as making an authentic commitment to try your best and follow any resulting instincts.</p>
<p>If you do only that, I believe it can make a world of difference. After all, that's basically how I wound up starting this firm, which has allowed me to help others build financial security for themselves by aligning their capital with companies that are driving positive change in the world.</p>
<p>A little more than 16% of our flagship investment strategy is invested in companies that are making our food system a little bit better and more resilient every day. They do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making low-cost loans available to family farmers and sustainable electric cooperatives,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuing cutting-edge research into synthetic biology, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing early-stage capital to the next generation of agriculture and food-tech startups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's very, very cool that we're able to make a professionally managed portfolio of companies like these available to almost anyone who can open an American brokerage account, regardless of how much money they have available to invest.</p>
<p>But I hope to compound my firm's impact even further by sharing our thoughts openly and regularly through missives like this one. If you've enjoyed it, <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">say so!</a> I would love to hear from you.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-became-an-active-manager"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/02/25/how-i-became-an-active-manager/">How I Became an Active Manager</a></h2>
<p>I've been following the financial markets since I could perceive time.</p>
<p>I first got paid to do it at Oppenheimer &amp; Company when I was nineteen years old. Wally Davis and Chuck Posternak hired me as an intern at what's now the <a href="https://www.oppenheimer.com/grandcentralpcg/">Grand Central Private Client Group</a>. I was paid $15 an hour to build spreadsheets that described clients' financial situations and our associated asset management positioning.</p>
<p>It ruled.</p>
<p>I got to meet with fund managers, build models, and generally research stuff to my heart's content. I also had unrestricted access to a Bloomberg terminal, which was one of the more exciting developments of my adolescence. But it wasn't my first contact with markets. That came much earlier thanks to my parents, who were both enterprising in their careers and open with their experiences as I was growing up.</p>
<p><strong>My mom liked to joke that she taught me the difference between debt and equity before I could ride a bike</strong>. Which is more or less true. She and my dad had an imperfect marriage, but their shared interest in the capital markets gave them a source of conversation on long car rides. Mom eventually left her career at Lehman Brothers to teach AP economics at Stuyvesant High School (Forbes wrote <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0412/second-acts-clarissa-bushman-careers-teaching-book-value.html?sh=2d5ad05c2453">a great piece</a> about that transition) so I guess it makes sense that I think of myself as her first student in addition to her first child. The picture above is me playing with her briefcase shortly after I learned to walk.</p>
<p>My dad is also one of the most insightful analysts I've ever met. While I was cutting my teeth at Oppenheimer in 2007, he was warning everyone who would listen about leverage in the financial system and pushing the investment community to re-evaluate companies like General Electric that had become addicted to financial engineering. I still watch his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qqyYDmOfs">first tv appearance about it</a> every once in a while as a reminder of how deeply the markets can misunderstand a company.</p>
<p>Even with these fantastic firsthand experiences, <strong>I struggled to understand why individual investors should invest their money in anything but index funds</strong>.</p>
<p>This chart, which shows the total return of both General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 since dad first went on TV to talk about it, gives a good sense of why.</p>

<p>An investor who decided to bet against GE after dad's interview aired would have had to incur significant cost, manage mechanical complexities, and wait close to a decade for the insight to deliver any benefit to them.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, a simple index fund investor would have compounded their capital faster and had more time to think about other things.</p>
<p>That's what I call a win-win.</p>
<p>My confidence in this simple and straightforward approach only grew as I gained more information.</p>
<p>Joining CFA Institute in 2010 gave me an opportunity to dive deep into state of the art academic research that surrounds the practice of investment management in a context where my sole responsibility was to highlight tools, tactics, and technologies that investment professionals make better decisions on behalf of their clients.</p>
<p>I started out writing educational materials, but quickly got sucked into the organization's online community-building efforts. I was put in charge of recruiting expert voices for what eventually became the <em><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/">Enterprising Investor</a></em> (still the #1 investing blog in the world <a href="https://blog.feedspot.com/investment_blogs/">according to Feedly</a>) and jumped in with both feet.</p>
<p>The task was to connect with the most thoughtful investors I could find and convince them to put their thoughts into writing on our platform. That led to some profoundly interesting work. Notable explorations of the <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/02/27/what-is-the-difference-between-investing-and-speculation-2/">difference between investing and speculation</a>, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/09/11/getting-schooled-in-risk-the-lessons-of-poker/">what poker teaches us about risk</a>, and the <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/02/12/betting-with-buffett-seven-lean-years-later/">lessons from a famous bet with Warren Buffett</a> are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Eventually I got to add my own voice into the mix in addition to curating expert views. I wrote about <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/10/28/enron-revisited-highlights-from-bear-stearns-research/">what Enron can teach financial analysts</a>, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/07/12/finding-faith-in-value-after-all-these-years/">the role that faith plays in investment processes</a>, and whether ESG and sustainability <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/09/01/does-esg-boost-returns/">could enhance investor returns</a>.</p>
<p>We did a lot of stuff I'm proud of. I even wrote <a href="http://www.jasonapollovoss.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Investment-Idea-Generation-Guide.pdf">a book</a> with my friend and mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/theintuitinvest">Jason Voss</a> about how to come up with original investment ideas.</p>
<p>I still couldn't see why individual investors would invest in anything but an index fund.</p>
<p><strong>And then I came out.</strong></p>
<p>It was 2017. I had been experiencing gender dysphoria for my whole life. And I finally felt able to do something about it besides distracting myself. I changed my name, my appearance, and my pronouns with the benefit of a supportive work environment, then prepared myself for whatever might happen when the rest of the world noticed.</p>

_Yours truly in Institutional Investor back when it was still a paper magazine. The full article is [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b15yww7r3f1jpm/gay-on-wall-street)._

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The years I've spent connecting to other queers since coming out have taught me to take my values seriously, hold myself accountable to my best intentions, and continuously improve my ability to listen.</p>
<p>They have also made me comfortable with who I am. I <a href="https://freemoneypodcast.com/">started a podcast</a> with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/sovereignfund">Ashby Monk</a> to explore how the world's most sophisticated investors were working to build a better future for finance, and began writing the "<a href="https://citywireusa.com/registered-investment-advisor/author/sortel">Inclusion in Wealth</a>" column for Citywire RIA to explore issues around diversity, equity, and belonging in our industry.</p>
<p>But I still wasn't an active manager.</p>
<p>Until my girlfriend and I sat down to have the conversation about how we would invest our money, I would have said it was interesting but not particularly applicable. And yes, I would have offered a full-throated defense of index funds and passive management.</p>
<p>But when we actually enumerated our values, <strong>it turned out that I held some pretty extreme views</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Companies should pay their taxes,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid preventable harm to living things, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care for the communities where they operate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though I've expressed them fairly concisely above, those values actually summarize a two page, single spaced <a href="https://investvegan.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Exclusion-Criteria-1.pdf">policy</a> that excludes companies with questionable products, conduct, or both from our investment strategies.</p>
<p>But however well-constructed our policy is, it's unlikely to produce compelling results unless it's part of a coherent <a href="https://investvegan.org/our-process/">investment process</a>.</p>
<p>There's a simple reason for that: our screening process isn't good enough.</p>
<p>It can't be.</p>
<p>The capital markets are literally a manifestation of the world's current power structure. Anything that people do will find a way to concretize in them somewhere. So eventually I realized there is no checklist comprehensive enough to rely upon.</p>
<p>You have to pay attention.</p>
<p>Because companies often talk a big game, but are absent when it comes time to come through for their communities. Because our goal is not just to identify companies that are shaping the world positively but also to generate financial stability for our clients. So I can't just buy the stuff that makes it through the screens and pretend I'm making the world a better place.</p>
<p>That's not to say that index funds are bad. Far from it! I have Jack Bogle's autograph sitting above my desk, and I still think that they do an excellent job growing people's money without requiring much in the way of oversight or critical thought.</p>
<p>They just have nothing to do with ethics.</p>
<p>And as an ethics-first investor, I owe it to everyone evaluating my strategy to be clear that there is substantial independent judgement and discretion involved in what we do.</p>
<p>We do not "set and forget" anything. My purpose in starting this firm is to support a restless search for better, more complete, and more reliable investment options than currently exist. And there is nothing passive about that process.</p>

<h2 id="dont-stop-with-divestment"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/02/09/dont-stop-with-divestment/">Don't Stop With Divestment</a></h2>
<p>Fossil duel divestment is all the rage these days, with bellwethers like the Harvard University endowment joining a decades-long movement to banish hydrocarbons from their investment programs.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://divestmentdatabase.org/">Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Commitments Database</a>, they join 1500 other institutions representing a total of $39.88 trillion that have taken such steps. To people who care about the environment, this is great news! Surely the first step towards a post-carbon economy is to stop investing in new coal, oil, and gas projects. And grassroots groups like <a href="https://350.org/">350.org</a> have done a great job mobilizing people through their <a href="https://gofossilfree.org/">go fossil free campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>But what happens after they succeed?</p>
<p>Once one arrives at the conclusion that these hydrocarbon-intensive undertakings no longer belong in a long-term investment portfolio, I would suggest that it becomes natural to look around and see what else is potentially unfit for investment. After all, the energy industry isn't the only one with moral shortcomings.</p>
<p>Sadly, they abound.</p>
<p>Most proponents of divestment understand this, acknowledge it, and are hoping that shifting assets away from these retrograde industries is the first step in a more comprehensive remaking of our financial system. But in general, they lack the deep financial expertise to translate that hope into a set of tangible proposals.</p>
<p>So let's jump start that conversation, shall we?</p>
<p>At Ethical Capital, our process compels us to draw barriers of acceptability in the capital markets. That’s because some practices - like commodifying animals through the sale of furs and hides - are reprehensible enough that we place any company that engages in them on a "naughty list" and exclude them from our investment portfolios.</p>
<p>From a philosophical standpoint, it’s important that we not make these evaluations in a vacuum. Though we might be intuitively motivated to align with certain causes over others, any honest exploration of problematic corporate practices will reveal many intersecting issues that cannot be examined in isolation.</p>
<h3 id="divestment-campaigns-are-narrow-by-necessity"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/02/09/dont-stop-with-divestment/#divestment-campaigns-are-narrow-by-necessity"><strong>Divestment Campaigns Are Narrow By Necessity</strong></a></h3>
<p>Thinking broadly about these issues is contrary to the prevailing trend in sustainable asset management, which seems to emphasize picking one cause, examining its impact, and creating a portfolio that narrowly reflects it.</p>
<p>Many divestment campaigns unwittingly endorse this approach, since their advocacy is centered on a relatively narrow issue. I don’t mean to minimize the work that they do. These campaigns are profoundly mobilizing, and tend to kick-start an institution’s ability to think about sustainable investing in the way that only public attention can.</p>
<p>But it would be ideal if they could also advocate for regenerative approaches to investing that would never have bought fossil fuels in the first place. Because what happens after they win?</p>
<p>Though it might be tempting to count each institution’s divestment as a victory, it won’t amount to much in the long term if they don’t commit to reforming the mindset that led to purchasing those positions in the first place. And the only way to do that is to move into a more positive frame of mind, where the focus is on what they will do, rather than what they won't.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-do-more-than-divestment"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/02/09/dont-stop-with-divestment/#how-to-do-more-than-divestment"><strong>How To Do More Than Divestment</strong></a></h3>
<p>The challenge when moving from a narrow engagement to a broader, longer-term one is that it can be hard to identify what goals to work towards. It's one thing to express a vague ambition to use one's portfolio to help people and the planet, but a different thing entirely to translate that into an investment program that is capable of meeting your personal, organizational, and ethical goals.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few questions you can ask that will help identify a path forward. Whether you're managing your own money, considering the best way to make change within your university, or just trying to understand ethical investing more broadly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Who manages the money?</strong> The asset management industry has an abysmal track record when it comes to diversity and inclusion. And often, the people making actual investment decisions aren't able to benefit from a broad diversity of experiences when they set out to make investment decisions. So be mindful about who you trust, and try to team up with people who actually share your values?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is their approach to investing in climate solutions?</strong> Do your best to look past vague "vanity" metrics and get a sense of the outcomes that the companies you have entrusted your assets to are trying to create. There are countless "low-carbon" portfolios that produce little real-world impact, load up on technology stocks with questionable ethics, and try to paint themselves as champions of change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where does ethics sit in their investment process?</strong> Traditional asset managers tend to try and separate ethical questions about what they fund from standard questions around risk and return, which can lead to a confused portfolio. Asking probing questions about the role of ethics in their investment process can help to highlight whether they're really capable of adjudicating the complex moral issues that often arise in the capital markets.</p>
</li>
</ul>

We are committed to publishing as much useful content here as we can, and would relish the opportunity to help you in your sustainable investment journey.
