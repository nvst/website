<h2 id="a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/">A Subtle Rebuttal to an Energy 'Realist'</a></h2>
<p>Larry Siegel recently <a href="https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2024/06/24/realist-assesses-energy-transition-laurence-siegel">put forward the argument</a> that radically reducing carbon emissions is incompatible with civilization on a planet of eight billion people.</p>
<p>He goes on to argue: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A full energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables will not happen. We are going to continue to emit a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and, as the economist and blogger Tyler Cowen is reputed to have said, "Mostly we're going to see how hot it gets."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tremendous respect for Larry. His work as Director of Research at the CFA Institute Research Foundation was a big part of my life in the nine years I spent on staff at CFA Institute. But the dichotomy between sustainability and prosperity that he presents is false. And his logic is not just flawed, but also seductive and therefore dangerous. </p>
<p>With that said, it wouldn't be particularly useful of me to simply say that I disagree. The investment community is rife with differences of opinion: they're literally required in order for the market to function. So I see it as my responsibility to not only wade into this discussion, but to voice my dissent constructively.  </p>
<p>The architecture of Larry's argument is fairly straightforward: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Access to energy is a necessary precondition for economic growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy demand will increase as countries in the global south grow their economies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting all this demand with current renewable energy technologies is not plausible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fossil fuels are therefore the only way to meet the demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preventing climate change is impossible given all the fossil fuels we must burn, so all we can do is adapt to it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of this is undeniable, but also incomplete. </p>
<p>The climate has already changed in ways that may be irreversible, so it's impossible to disagree with Larry's conclusion that we ought to focus on adapting to climate change instead of preventing it. </p>
<p>But after thoughtful consideration of what adaptation might actually cost and involve, it's similarly impossible to conclude that blindly increasing our consumption of fossil fuels in a bid to boost growth is a sane path forward. The costs associated with Larry's plan would be profound, the growth he claims it would unlock may never materialize, and the ethics of putting such a plan forward are immensely problematic. </p>
<p>Over the following paragraphs, we'll take a deep look at what adapting to climate change actually means. Over the course of that exploration, it will become clear that the risks of acceding to this proposed future far outweigh the potential benefits. </p>
<h3 id="we-cant-know-what-comes-next"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#we-cant-know-what-comes-next">We Can't Know What Comes Next</a></h3>
<p>I wish we could take it as a given that the global south will experience the economic growth it needs over the coming decade. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a recent <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/04/14/the-great-reversal-prospects-risks-and-policies-in-international-development-association-countries">World Bank report</a> makes this impossible. The authors examined the seventy-five countries eligible for loans and grants from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), which are the poorest countries in the world by definition, and found some disquieting results.</p>
<p>The headline is stark: more than half of these countries are growing more slowly than the rich world. And fully one third of them are poorer today than they were at the onset of the COVID pandemic. This is a significant change from the past: We have to look back to the late 1990s in order to find a period where broadly increasing prosperity was this unusual. </p>
<p>I can't tell you exactly why this is, but here's one contributing factor: over the course of the last thirty years, jobs have reliably been created in lower cost economies as supply chains globalized in search of the most capital-efficient means of production. But after the frailties of this system were laid bare by the global pandemic, global companies began to "nearshore" or "friendshore" their operations in order to mitigate exposure to future shocks. </p>
<p>Firm-level benefits aside, further fragmentation of the previous world order is likely to have chilling effects on global economic growth. </p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/20/The-Price-of-De-Risking-Reshoring-Friend-Shoring-and-Quality-Downgrading-545774">IMF working paper</a> estimates a long-term global GDP loss of 4.5 percent if global economic integration reverts to its level in the year 2000, which was before China joined the World Trade Organization. Almost everyone would be worse off in this scenario, especially if tariffs and other barriers to trade were to be enacted as "corrective" measures. </p>
<p>And regrettably, some degree of such action is likely in the near future. To be clear: I am not predicting this. And I am certainly not rooting for it. </p>
<p><strong>But the reality is simple: broader, more inclusive global growth is not a foregone conclusion under any circumstances. Trends in global trade patterns that made it seem that way may be reverting just as costly challenges are materializing.</strong></p>
<p>Climate change is one of the most significant such challenges. Natural disasters already cost the average IDA country 1.3% of its GDP per year, and that has roughly doubled in recent decades. And though it's difficult to know exactly what will happen as the climate changes, the consensus view is that these disasters will intensify. </p>
<h3 id="lets-see-how-hot-it-gets"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#lets-see-how-hot-it-gets">Let's See How Hot it Gets</a></h3>
<p>Here in the intermountain west, it's already obvious that a little bit of warming goes a long way. There is more than 300 million tons of dead wood in Colorado's forests that's rapidly drying into tinder for future wildfires. </p>
<p>This isn't just nightmare fuel. It's also the state's fastest growing forest carbon pool.</p>
<p>New, healthy trees don't automatically grow back in their place because the ecological niches these species have evolved to inhabit no longer exist. </p>
<p>This is far from an aesthetic consideration: these trees have historically provided a far-reaching suite of services to the surrounding ecosystems. And even if we had the data and audacity to claim that we fully understand these support structures, we won't be able to replicate them without colossal, costly effort.  </p>
<p><strong>This single spillover effect from climate change has already turned the skies in New York City orange, caused more than half of the most dangerous air pollution in the American West, and left our ecosystems vulnerable to invasive species.</strong> </p>
<p>And this is ground truth, not a projection. </p>
<p>If we move towards the future on the path Larry proposes, we have no ready means of knowing what we will unleash.</p>
<p>The climate scientist slang for a future of fossil-fueled economic development is "taking the highway," and the IPCC has a dedicated model to describe it. They refer to it as Shared Socioeconomic Pathway(SSP) 5-8.5. </p>
<p>It's really quite a fascinating model, but it can be difficult to draw functional conclusions from without a bit of help. Fortunately, a <a href="https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/">new web app</a> from spatial ecologist Matthew Fitzpatrick at the University of Maryland can help us imagine the disruptions that lurk down that path.</p>
<p>The app extends and updates a 2019 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08540-3">analysis</a> published in <em>Nature Communications</em> to allow anyone to see how the climate is likely to change in 40,581 places and 5,323 cities around the world under SSP5-8.5. </p>
<p>Some of these allegories are dramatic: "If you happen to live in New York City, you would need to travel to northern Mississippi to experience what New York is expected to feel like by 2080. Say hello to hot, really humid summers and goodbye to snow in winter." </p>
<p>But the profound danger of Larry's plan becomes even clearer when we take a tour through the largest equatorial cities. By 2080, the climate in Lagos, Kinshasa, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Riyadh, Accra, Dar Es Salaam, and Manila will have changed so starkly that there is nowhere on earth we can look to as an analogy. And that's not a complete list. </p>
<p>Taipei and Singapore will suffer the same fate, so in this future we can at least look forward to a tidy natural experiment that will demonstrate whether — and to what extent — wealth will work to shield us against an unearthly reality. </p>
<p>Not everything is bad and getting worse. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is back to record coral cover, for instance. And though that should cheer us, it's important to remember that these advances come after a <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/protecting/our-investments#:~:text=Together%20with%20the%20Queensland%20government,crown-of-thorns%20starfish.">$5 billion funding commitment</a> from the government of Australia. </p>
<p>With that in mind, it's reasonable to wonder what other costs would mount as the planet warms further. And remember that proceeding upon a development path that ignores those costs creates liabilities that will encumber future economic growth when they come due. </p>
<p>On this subject, my central insight is not that hard to grasp: it's much simpler to avoid a mess than clean up after one. The interlinked ecological systems affected by the climate are profoundly complex and already struggling. </p>
<p>Investment professionals like me and Larry have a clear role to play in helping society navigate the implications of this, but we'll need to have a good, hard look at our professional ethics in order to do that effectively. </p>
<h3 id="capital-gains-for-me-ruin-for-thee"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#capital-gains-for-me-ruin-for-thee">Capital Gains for Me, Ruin For Thee</a></h3>
<p>My most profound misgiving about Larry's line of argumentation is that he will not experience anything close to the worst outcomes of climate change. </p>
<p>As a fellow American and member of the investor class, both he and I are not just geographically remote from the worst of these outcomes, but will likely be able to afford whatever tech-enabled tools arise to mitigate the reality he advocates for.</p>
<p>Most folks in the global south would have no such succor, yet Larry would say he is writing out of concern for their prosperity. Underneath a chart that presents a clear linear relationship between energy use per capita and GDP per capita, he writes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Economic growth is pushing almost every country... toward prosperity. Pushing them back... would be the cruelest joke ever played on what Frantz Fanon called "the wretched of the Earth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would hate to be involved in a cruel joke of any form, so let's embrace the premise that there's a straightforward path to sustained growth in any given country for a second. We'll restrict our analysis to a single country - the Democratic Republic of the Congo - to keep things fairly tangible. </p>
<p>Imagine that after adopting our fossil fuel led development agenda, Congolese GDP grows constantly at the fastest clip observed in any single year since 1960 — 9.7% — for each of the fifty-five years between us and the year 2080. Assuming no change to population size, their GDP per capita would reach roughly the same level we enjoy today in the United States. </p>
<p>Would that be worth it? </p>
<p>From the narrow standpoint of global investors, maybe. Even just one growth story of that magnitude would unleash a bonanza for us capital markets types. And if we buy the premise that Larry's plan would unlock growth of a similar magnitude across the global south, it gets very easy to anticipate describing our net worths with an extra comma or two. </p>
<p><strong>But at what cost, and to whom?</strong> </p>
<p>After 5°C worth of global warming, any remaining Kinshasans would likely have to contend with fatal wet bulb temperatures throughout the rainy season. It's possible that the mining industry would find ways to keep employees safe enough to keep the flow of critical minerals going, but that might involve wearing something akin to a space suit whenever they go outside. The agricultural sector — which currently employs about three-fourths of the country's labor force — would be eviscerated.</p>
<p>Are the people of the Congo asking for this? Do they have the strong democratic institutions that would be necessary to grant their informed consent? We can certainly find individuals who align with Larry's thinking, but that's a long way away from a popular consensus. </p>
<p>The moral argument Larry makes is particularly seductive to western ears. But I'd like to foreground something James Baldwin said in the 1970 documentary <em>Meeting the Man: James Baldwin in Paris</em> as we explore it.<em>.</em> </p>
<p>Here's the quote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You, the English, you, the French, you, the West, you, the Christians. You can't help but feel that there is something you can do for me. That you can save me. And you do not yet know that I have endured your salvation so long, I cannot afford it anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upshot here is straightforward: whatever their motivations, western interventions aimed at promoting prosperity are not necessarily welcomed by the folks they seek to support. </p>
<p>Think about how much would need to go right for future Congolese people to celebrate this plan retrospectively. </p>
<p>Growth would have to come fast, then last. </p>
<p>And even more unlikely: we must assume that both the political will to do something about all of the resulting negative externalities and the technology to actually get that done would arise at some point. </p>

<p>I don't want to run the risk of mischaracterizing Larry or Mark Mills, the analyst he quotes extensively in his essay. So there's a big quote from them coming soon. But because their argument talks a lot about GDP growth, I'll first remind you that Simon Kuznets — the economist who came up with GDP — had the following to say about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDP 'measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope having that handy makes the next few paragraphs a bit more fun for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The proportion of the world's GDP spent on energy-in-the-large, including food and animal feed, has decreased by an order of magnitude since the early modern era. A society that spends upwards of 70 percent of its income on food and fodder is poor indeed...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/AD_4nXe616uR0Ks1VTv2VO2eOTnvlREHqn0IlbVXDr2ccuVvooOYuQsFwiLENJvoQgjrHYE-qIPx85U8ISUY-_fkp_UN2xg03fGbyIHdv7koSrxX7ygVtnLnFOr2CsmyIbsqbTtizo8JqWYqBGOawQcBbDzf-nNu?key=onMyQ6TvvwXik9hTgP-qag"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But energy costs as a share of GDP didn't really fall off a cliff until the rapid industrialization of the nineteenth century, powered by coal and then oil and gas. </p>
<p>This may be counterintuitive: don't heavy industries use a lot of energy? Yes, but an industrial economy is so much more productive than an agricultural and handcraft economy that the denominator – world GDP – grew massively. </p>
<p>Thus, the energy share fell even as the absolute consumption of energy soared. Interestingly, the energy share of GDP has remained about the same – around 10 percent –since the early 1900s. </p>
<p>This is not because energy use remained stable, but because energy use and economic output exploded upward roughly in tandem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting that Larry and Mark celebrate the role of technological development in producing this output explosion, but neglect to consider it in their analysis of renewable energy technologies. Their case that the energy needed to fuel growth must come from fossil fuels rests on the unstated assumption that renewables technology will not improve.</p>
<p>This is ahistorical. </p>
<p>The cost of building new wind and solar facilities has declined by orders of magnitude over the past twenty years while their efficiency has grown by leaps and bounds. And new battery chemistries are emerging based on plentiful, inexpensive minerals like sodium which may further reshape the energy landscape over coming decades. </p>
<p><strong>In other words, today's renewable energy technologies may not be able to fulfill global energy demand, but tomorrow's might.</strong> </p>
<p>The 18th century economist Thomas Malthus used similar logic to argue that the supply of food could not keep pace with the growth of the human population. But new developments in agricultural technology intervened and our planet is now home to roughly eight times as many humans who enjoy a much higher standard of living than those ancestors. </p>
<p>So as we consider the argument that fossil fuels are the only source capable of meeting our energy needs, let's remember that things have a way of changing. The first patents for solar panels and wind turbines were only granted in the 1880s, and they've since evolved from novelties into economically viable alternatives. </p>
<p>This is particularly important because the path Larry and Mark propose has significant costs in addition to money. Average temperatures have already <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions">risen by .8°C</a> relative to their average between 1961 and 1990, and it's worth underlining that the order-of-magnitude increases in quality of living as measured by the cost of food and fodder had already materialized by 1900. </p>
<p>We have cell phones and the internet now, but also PFAS, and — according to <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2019/9/long-term-trends-in-deaths-of-despair">a great report</a> from the Republican side of Congress' Joint Economic Committee — a level of mortality from deaths of despair like suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease that "surpasses anything seen in America since the dawn of the 20th century." </p>
<p><strong>There's one thing we never had back then: plastic.</strong> </p>
<p>That's not particularly interesting at first glance. Production volume in almost everything has grown by leaps and bounds in the postwar period. But there is one particularly pertinent thing to remember about plastics: they're made of oil. </p>
<p>And demand for them is a huge part of global oil demand. To wit: the International Energy Agency's latest <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024">medium-term oil outlook</a> notes that Chinese imports of plastic polymers, synthetic fibers like polyester, and other intermediate petrochemicals produced roughly as much oil demand as the entire country of Germany in 2023. </p>
<p>The authors expect rising demand for petrochemicals (which, to be fair, is a much broader category than just plastics) to drive roughly three quarters of the increase in global oil demand between now and 2030. </p>
<p>And that's worth remembering as you read the first sentence of Larry's concluding section, which notes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some would say that it's worth sacrificing almost everything we value in life to "save the planet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the discussion is framed that way, it's easy to overlook the many tangible steps that can be taken to mitigate the negative effects of fossil fuel consumption. </p>
<p>I doubt anyone would sign up to live in an unrecognizable world in order to preserve some semblance of normalcy. But that's exactly the world that will result from Larry's proposed path forward: just think about all of the cities with an unearthly future that we've talked about.   </p>
<p>By contrast, a future with less plentiful polymers is a lot easier to stomach. Wouldn't you be willing to give up plastic bottles and polyester for a chance at a more sustainable future? Wading into trade-offs like this is at the heart of effective adaptation to climate change, which Larry and I agree is absolutely essential. </p>
<p>So what does it look like to take that challenge seriously?</p>
<h3 id="arise-acolytes-of-adaptation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#arise-acolytes-of-adaptation">Arise, Acolytes of Adaptation!</a></h3>
<p>We won't make progress on anything without a cogent and comprehensive definition of the problem we're dealing with. </p>
<p>When we talk about climate change, we're often referring to a more complex set of changes linked to the consequences of human activity on the surrounding environment. </p>
<p>A team of researchers has helpfully <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh2458">enumerated</a> each of the nine planetary processes that are essential for maintaining the stability and resilience of the earth as a whole. The extra large illustration below shows those nine systems, as well as the riskiness of their current state.</p>
<figure>

![Graphic depicting the nine biological systems that are essential for the biosphere to continue supporting life and their present state. ](images/Planetary-boundaries.png)

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Climate change is just one of these nine processes, and CO2 concentration is not even its most acutely stressed facet at the moment. That distinction belongs to radiative forcing, which is what happens when the amount of energy entering earth's atmosphere is greater than the amount that leaves it.</p>
<p>This framework invites us to think about the sustainability of activities in a fuller context. Take cutting down a forest for example: it has carbon implications to be sure, but also can lead the earth to absorb more solar radiation if the ground is darker than the forest that used to cover it. </p>
<p>Such activity also removes habitat, which can lead to the endangerment and extinction of species and a loss of genetic diversity in the biosphere. If the forest were to be replaced with farmland, there would likely also be increases in biogeochemical flows from the introduction of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Pesticides and other chemicals would likely come alongside them, introducing novel entities into the environment. And the farm would also have to be irrigated, which presages changes in freshwater use. </p>
<p><strong>These connections are straightforward once they've been illuminated, but will likely be new to most readers. If nothing else, they highlight how intricately linked these systems are and allow us to imagine the non-monetary costs associated with upsetting them further.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>But that's not all: they are also confounding for ideologues, who often put forward one big solution for all of the planet's woes.</strong> </p>
<p>Take electrification for example. The quote below that Larry shares from Mark Mills is undeniably true today: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world already digs up an amount of earth equal to 7000 Great Pyramids per year to shift from gas, oil, and coal to the minerals required for the energy transition. These include nickel, cadmium, tellurium, obviously lithium, and cobalt among other minerals. You would have to dig up 50,000 Pyramids' worth of the Earth each year to get [enough of] those minerals [to complete the transition].  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of that mining already has drastic consequences for the biosphere. To keep this essay readable, I'll refrain from enumerating all of them. </p>
<p>But readers rooting for the immediate and wholesale replacement of fossil fuels should be aware that they're advocating for something with profound spillover effects. </p>
<p>So where does that leave us? </p>
<p><strong>The messy gray area where progress actually happens.</strong> </p>
<p>In a perfect world, we could rely on a combination of environmental markets and regulation to accurately price the external costs associated with all human activities.</p>
<p>That world sounds nice, but we don't live there.</p>
<p>So as we think about how to reduce the harm associated with human activity, we need to resist one size fits all solutions and seek instead to understand the checkerboard of local realities that create the global energy picture. And the reality is that burning oil or natural gas would be a huge improvement in some places, since it would replace dirtier energy sources like coal. </p>
<p><strong>For as long as the world remains imperfect, it's incumbent upon analysts like me and Larry to embrace the reality that many things can be true at once. There is no "magic bullet" solution waiting in the wings to relieve our planet's many stresses, nor a simple tradeoff between economic growth and sustainability.</strong> </p>
<p>We live in a world with finite resources but infinite desires. And over the past century, we've allowed those desires to set the economic agenda without much interference. </p>
<p>None of us can put forward a complete solution to solve the climate crisis while preserving our economic prosperity, and we should acknowledge that at every opportunity. After all, we are in the business of making decisions amid conditions of uncertainty. And people often think that means we know much more than we actually do. </p>
<p>That's why, as we close this exploration, it feels important to draw attention to the malignant overconfidence with which us finance types can sometimes trod through thorny ethical terrain. </p>
<p>If we come to believe that we can speak with certitude on behalf of people we have never met about their own best interest, we imperil our ability to serve our social function, weaken our standing as a profession, and diminish ourselves individually in the process.</p>
<p>The only thing we can know about the future is that it's coming. The fuel that powers it, the technology that shapes it, and the people we'll share it with are yet to be determined. But it's likely that the world will stay an inherently subtle place no matter what happens, and I hope me and my colleagues at Ethical Capital will be here to help you embrace that nuance. </p>

<h2 id="3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/">3 Practical Questions for Corporate Stewards About Decarbonization</a></h2>
<p>I feel for the many corporate directors and executives that are trying to chart a credible path towards net zero.</p>
<p>Best intentions, board-level buy in, and a big budget aren't enough to do the kind of deep decarbonization work that's necessary. And I'll eat a shoe if anyone can prove to me that all three of those conditions are present at even a plurality of corporations.</p>
<p>So what's a well-meaning manager to do?</p>
<p>In the conversations I've had with executives at the companies in our portfolio over the past year, I get the sense that there's a lack of useful guidance about what moving towards net zero actually looks like. As a practical matter, almost all of them probably assume that they need to start by hiring consultants to build a detailed estimate of their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.</p>
<p>And like, sure. That's a step.</p>
<p><strong>But it's the opposite of a functional understanding.</strong> Think about it: there's nothing wrong with hiring consultants, but it's a literal cry for help. And there are real limits to the contributions that third parties can make to something as central to long-term strategy as decarbonization.</p>
<p>So I've decided to clarify how we understand the problem, the sorts of corporate actions that matter to us, and where we see the biggest opportunities for near-term progress.</p>
<p>Whether you're considering investing in one of our strategies, wondering how to get your company on the right path, or just hoping to get your hands around the problem, I hope you'll let us know how we can make this more useful to you by leaving a public comment or sending us a private note.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-you-learned-recently"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-have-you-learned-recently">What Have You Learned Recently?</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/#overview-section-2">fifth National Climate Assessment</a> that was recently delivered to congress estimates that extreme weather events already cost the United States $150 Billion each year. That figure doesn't account for loss of life, healthcare costs, damages to ecosystem services, or what's happening in the other 194 countries on the planet.</p>
<p>Our black, brown, and indigenous siblings will doubtless experience the worst of this. But I also expect the direct costs of climate change to permanently kill the vibes in more than a handful of boardrooms. Uneven, extreme, and unpredictable changes always seem to catch at least a handful of companies unprepared.</p>
<p>The traditional corporate playbook has been to claim that such risks are well controlled.</p>
<p><strong>I categorically reject such claims</strong>. What I want instead (and consider to be table stakes) is a publicly available discussion of how a company has improved their understanding and control of these risks at least once a year for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>My favorite leaders already approach this conversation with humility, vulnerability, and candor. In the coming years, I hope they'll start to feel comfortable doing that in public.</p>
<p>And I'll never need another Christmas present if they start to normalize practices like sharing new words they've learned, exposing things they've gotten wrong, and asking for help or insight from their stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="what-capacity-can-you-build-in-the-next-three-years"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-capacity-can-you-build-in-the-next-three-years">What Capacity Can You Build in the Next Three Years?</a></h3>
<p>It might not be entirely clear how to go about capacity-building, so here are a few things leaders ought to contemplate charging their teams with in roughly ascending order of ambition, complexity, and career risk.</p>
<h4 id="source-carbon-removals1"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#source-carbon-removals1"><strong>Source Carbon Removals</strong><a href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#8662e7de-0fbc-41b0-94f9-61b89d7d60d8">1</a></a></h4>
<p>If you're still doing the spewing, it's time to get started undoing.</p>
<p>The carbon removal market barely exists today, but every single one of the roughly 2,600 organizations with a <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/">science-based net zero target</a> is wholly reliant on it to actually reach their net zero goal. Why? Because it's not particularly likely that any complex organization can truly reach zero carbon emissions by just decarbonizing their operations.</p>
<p>What are Carbon Removals?</p>
<p>Carbon Removals refer to processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere and demonstrably keep it from being re-emitted for extremely long periods of time.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/p/SBTi-purchases-analysis">only 32 companies</a> with these commitments had actually bought carbon removals as of September 2023. And according to <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/">cdr.fyi</a>, only about 120,000 tonnes of carbon removal have ever been delivered.</p>
<p>If your company plans to eventually purchase carbon removals at some scale in order to meet your net zero goal, you should begin immediately. And if you do not plan to participate in the market, say so.</p>
<p>Many corporate executives will feel that if they participate in this market, they will be expected to cover each and every ton of carbon they emit immediately. This can turn a well-intentioned climate plan into a weird spreadsheet game that's more about scoring arbitrary carbon points than manifesting impact.</p>
<p>Save us all some trouble and skip that step for now.</p>
<p>Instead, acknowledge that this is a multi-decade process that will require new internal sourcing capacity, supplier relationships, and strategic planning. Focus on quality over quantity, and remember that you're entering a new market that you will likely participate in for a long time. This is a rare circumstance where bravely taking baby steps will count as leadership.</p>
<h4 id="strengthen-industry-standards"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#strengthen-industry-standards"><strong>Strengthen Industry Standards</strong></a></h4>
<p>Evaluate any professional associations that may be relevant to your industry, and ask whether they're currently issuing guidance on how members should adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>Is that guidance good enough? If not, why not?</p>
<p>Remember that there is power in networks. In uncertain times, strengthening the soft infrastructure that surrounds you and your colleagues can be hugely clarifying.</p>
<p>The intended goal isn't just to elevate the status of your own company but to influence industry standards on decarbonization as a whole. This can actually enrich the quality of your own strategy by sourcing incremental inputs from a larger professional network and decrease the career risk of climate action by building momentum and broader buy-in.</p>
<p>It may also be possible and appropriate to create industry-facing resources that discuss your company's environmental processes, failures, and successes. In time, this could create a shared repository of knowledge that other companies can refer to when bolstering their own practices.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting you spill any trade secrets here. Take a page from the software industry, where it's common practice for engineering organizations to write about how they approach complex problems. In many cases, firms will even create open-source infrastructure that others can use to tackle these same issues. Do the folks thinking about decarbonizing your fleets feel like they can publish their analysis of the current trade-offs? If not, why not?</p>
<p>Lastly, take a long hard look at your lobbying activity. Are you advocating for stricter environmental regulations? I think you should be. This probably seems short-sighted, idealistic, and insane to some readers, but consider that it will also concretize the costs of credible climate action and build them into the cost projections of every major actor in your industry.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-your-stakeholders-saying"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-are-your-stakeholders-saying">What Are Your Stakeholders Saying?</a></h3>
<p>Credible plans are intrinsically unique. Every business has its own ethos, targets, and constraints, and so should every climate action plan.</p>
<p>Done right, this won't create conflict between your company's idiosyncratic approach and the reporting required by the folks who oversee the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/">science-based targets</a> initiative. Instead, it will help translate the long-term ambitions you've committed to into shorter-term steps and tangible decarbonization progress.</p>
<p>Effective climate action will unfold in a dynamic process that responds to changes in technology, regulation, community needs, and your company's practical circumstances. Don't make the mistake of carving your approach in stone. Instead, celebrate what you've learned by sharing how and why your approach has evolved.</p>
<p>I love it when managers directly cite stakeholder feedback as the root cause for these sorts of updates.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It's straightforward: mainstream investors have been conditioned to care about ESG disclosures because they contain useful hints about whether a company is capable of considering and controlling risk holistically. The quality, diversity, and frequency of your stakeholder communications are the main mechanism that such considerations manifest through.</p>
<p>So instead of spending all of your time on the outlook for next quarter or next year, think about ways to give us direct visibility into how you manage those relationships.</p>
<p>It might be uncomfortable in the short term, but that's something we'll all have to get used to. Because even though there's material uncertainty in the path climate change will take, there is no reasonable projection that could be described as "comfortable."</p>

<h2 id="seek-perfection-elsewhere"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/07/26/seek-perfection-elsewhere/">Seek Perfection Elsewhere</a></h2>
<p>In conversation with many of you over the past few weeks, I've found myself repeating the phrase "it's unrealistic to commit to ethical perfection."</p>
<p>Given that I manage an "ethical growth" strategy and an "ethics-first" investment firm, this statement bears some explanation.</p>
<p>We invest in public markets, which typically reflect the latent desires of the wealthiest folks on the planet.</p>
<p>Overseeing our investments in such circumstances requires a commitment to creative thinking, deep research, and continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Or, to put it another way... it requires one heck of a bullshit detector.</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few quick examples of things we find regularly while examining companies that have been lauded as harbingers of a happier future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boardrooms full of billionaire buddies in their "third wife" era,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's just say "Epstein ties," and saddest of all:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams with earnest commitment to driving positive impact, but extremely slim chances of doing so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It drives me crazy to see companies like this bundled together, branded as something like the "transformative climate innovation fund," and marketed to people like you.</p>
<p>This happens because once Wall Street realized that millions of kind people actually cared about participating in the construction of a better future for the planet, the marketing machine took over.</p>
<p>At that point, it became inevitable that dreck, dross, and douchebags would pervade the sustainable investing landscape in the way they do today.</p>
<p><strong>So what can we do about it?</strong></p>
<p>I know for sure that step one is simple: refuse to make stupid promises.</p>
<p>But as far as I can tell, step two never ends.</p>
<p>That's the part where we wade through all of the grey areas, moral ambiguities, and intentional misdirections that characterize modern capitalism while keeping our moral compass intact.</p>
<p>What I hope to do in the coming weeks is start doing step three alongside it, which is where we begin giving more regular, direct, and detailed downloads on the things we've learned while working through our process each lunar cycle.</p>
<p>I hope you'll join us for our first full moon webinar this coming August 1st at 1pm. If you <a href="https://investvegan.org/gimmewebinar">click here to register</a>, you can even join the conversation directly and ask whatever questions are on your mind.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could deliver ethical perfection. But in its absence, I hope that more regular doses of our honest perspectives will suffice.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-need-diversification"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/">Do You Need Diversification?</a></h2>
<p>There are few financial concepts as fundamental as diversification, but most of the people I speak with can't really begin to understand what it means or why they might need it.</p>
<p>I get it! This stuff isn't exactly intuitive.</p>
<p>At a high level, diversification is a way to control the level of risk in an investment portfolio. But I want to give you a functional understanding of this concept, so let's talk through an example.</p>
<p>Imagine for a second that your portfolio is composed of just a single stock. When that stock goes up, so does the value of your portfolio. But that dynamic also works in the other direction, which is not particularly desirable.</p>
<h5 id="diversifications-definite-benefit"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/#diversifications-definite-benefit"><strong>Diversification's Definite Benefit</strong></a></h5>
<p>We can clearly see the benefits of diversification when we add a second stock to the portfolio.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Stock 1</strong></th>
<th><strong>Stock 2</strong></th>
<th><strong>Portfolio</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>+1%</td>
<td>-1%</td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The first stock is up and the other is down, which means the value of the overall portfolio remains unchanged.</p>
<p>In practice, we rarely come across examples like this, because even though the two stocks may have fundamentally different characteristics, most of them perform similarly over short time periods. Diversification is excellent at ensuring that aberrant performance from any one stock - sometimes referred to as "idiosyncratic risk" - doesn't detract too much from the performance of the overall portfolio.</p>
<p>But this protection has a limit.</p>
<p>That's because some of the risk of investing in stocks is "systematic," which is a fancy way of saying that it's related more to financial conditions in the broad economy than the details of any particular company. Increasing the number of holdings in a portfolio cannot protect an investor from these systematic risks.</p>
<p>So if we imagine that the company behind Stock 1 is embroiled in a value-destroying scandal, it's clear that an investor in a diversified portfolio would have a better experience than one that owned just that one company. But in the case of broader economic issues, all of the companies might wind up being affected similarly.</p>
<h5 id="diversifications-diminishing-value"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/#diversifications-diminishing-value"><strong>Diversification's Diminishing Value</strong></a></h5>
<p>You don't need a PhD in finance to realize that diversification can only provide a certain amount of protection.</p>
<p>The chart below shows that this benefit actually declines with each incremental stock that you add. So there's a massive benefit from moving to something more diversified from a one-stock portfolio. But there's no sense in just swallowing up every stock you can get your hands on in the name of diversification.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The chart above shows that there's still significant incremental value in diversification until one's portfolio holds more than a hundred stocks. But our flagship <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">flagship strategy</a> strategy only has about twenty stocks in it.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<h5 id="diversifications-drawbacks"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/#diversifications-drawbacks">Diversification's Drawbacks</a></h5>
<p>For investment strategies like ours, which are predicated on strong <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-investment-beliefs-and-competitive-advantages/">investment beliefs</a> and require a significant amount of fundamental research, diversification can be almost synonymous with value destruction unless it is managed incredibly carefully.</p>
<p>This concept is not particularly intuitive to people who haven't spent their literal entire lives thinking about how to manage money ethically, so let me walk you through it in some depth.</p>
<p>In order to make it into our investment portfolio, a company must satisfy every step in our <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">investment process</a>. This includes a deep dive into the ethical concerns surrounding their products and conduct as well as a close examination of their financial prospects. So in effect, the composition and design of our flagship strategy is a response to practical constraints. We simply aren't able to identify and monitor 100 companies that we think our clients ought to own.</p>
<p>Again, remember that diversification is just one way to manage risk.</p>
<p>The careful research we do also serves to significantly mitigate investment risk. Absurd or adverse consequences could result if we were to begin buying every ethical-sounding business that's publicly traded. The extent to which this is true has really surprised me, and I wrote <a href="https://ethicic.com/how-i-became-an-active-manager/">an essay</a> a few months ago describing my intellectual evolution to this point which may be of interest to those who find this topic fascinating.</p>
<p>But I suspect the majority of our clients and community members are just trying to make a decision between a diversified portfolio and a more concentrated approach. So let's steer right into those questions.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-want-a-diversified-portfolio-or-a-concentrated-one"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/#do-you-want-a-diversified-portfolio-or-a-concentrated-one">Do You Want a Diversified Portfolio or a Concentrated one?</a></h5>
<p>There's no perfect answer, but I can definitely help you peer inside of the way we manage portfolios here to identify what's most important to you.</p>
<p>In the table below, I've enumerated several considerations that are relevant to clients choosing between our <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">Global Opportunities</a> strategy and the <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/core-portfolio-collection/">more diversified portfolios</a> that we customize for their specific needs.</p>
<p>To do this, we add external ETFs and mutual funds with aligned oversight practices. This allows us to broaden a client's portfolio without diluting our other strategies, and can create a more balanced portfolio.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks, so here is a table that can help you compare the two on three high-level criteria.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">Global Opportunities</a></th>
<th><a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/core-portfolio-collection/">Core Portfolio Collection</a></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ethics</td>
<td>All research and oversight are directly overseen by me, meaning we can manage ethical concerns with unusual precision.</td>
<td>A portion of portfolios are managed by research teams at other firms. All of them have strong processes that align with our own, but we have significantly less control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Predictability</td>
<td>Month-to-month performance will be more volatile, and may diverge from popular stock indices for long periods of time.</td>
<td>Performance is still inherently volatile (it's the stock market, after all) but is likely to be more similar to popular stock indices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>All research and portfolio management is included in our standard fee.</td>
<td>Additional fund-level costs (which vary) are imposed by the Mutual Funds and ETFs selected to add diversification. We do not receive any of these fees.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>With all this said, I'd be a silly goose if I didn't mention that there's no reason to navigate this alone.</p>
<p>If you've read this far and still aren't sure which path is more appealing, you should probably <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">reach out</a>. We love helping kind people design investment strategies that help them maximize the probability of realizing their financial goals, so please don't hesitate to use us as a resource.</p>

<h2 id="our-investment-beliefs"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/05/30/our-investment-beliefs/">Our Investment Beliefs</a></h2>
<p>Our investment beliefs spring straight from our mission, pervade our process, and help us pursue safe passage through the perpetually uncertain investment landscape.</p>
<p>In that sense, they serve as a foundation for our long-term investment goals while ensuring that we make consistent investment decisions that mitigate risk, manifest impact, and maximize the long-term stability of our portfolios.</p>
<p>We believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Active management is the only way to effectively fulfil an ethics-first investment mandate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses associated with preventable harm to living things are identifiable, avoidable, and likely to underachieve over long time horizons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creative synthesis of ethical and fundamental data uncovers opportunities to align capital with companies as they compound their contributions to society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embedded controls to promote long-term thinking and analysis are a necessary precondition for delivering acceptable results over multiple economic cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focused, high-conviction portfolios are superior to more diversified alternatives for long-term investors with an ability to deeply understand each underlying asset. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be difficult to avoid delivering differentiated results to our clients over time if we stay true to these beliefs.</p>
<p>Our unique approach to long-term investing, ethical screening, and integration of diverse viewpoints places <a href="https://investvegan.org/our-process/">our research process</a> significantly outside the norm.</p>
<p>We see this fundamental strangeness as a sustainable competitive advantage, and have found that the individuals and institutions that are best suited to working with us tend to agree.</p>
<p>In addition to that, our principal competitive advantages come from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ethical alignment we share with our clients, which allows us to stay firm in our moral convictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our unique process, which embeds significant risk controls into our regular course of business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our long-term outlook, which allows us to look past day-to-day volatility with patience and confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our relationships with the investment community, which allow us to regularly access the skill and experience of collaborators outside our organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relentless focus on total portfolio outcomes, which allows us to remain focused on what actually matters to clients.</p>
</li>
