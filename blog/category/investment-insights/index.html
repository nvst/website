<p>We work hard to identify and invest in companies that generate positive real-world impact in the same way they generate revenue.</p>
<p>This isn't just about feeling good. For one thing, we consider companies with a positive, well-established role in a broader system to be more resilient than their competitors. They tend to be good stewards of their corporate assets, with well-established governance procedures and clear processes to mitigate conflicts with shareholders.</p>
<p>With that said, companies are social organisms with living, breathing components. Which makes it difficult to capture what makes them special with mere statistics. Fortunately, concentration is one of the hallmarks of our investment style. Which means it's possible for us to pull together brief narratives about our holdings which you can read through at your leisure.</p>
<p>This approach differs significantly from the way investment firms typically talk about impact.</p>
<p>The tendency is to produce reports which focus on a handful of issues like climate, waste, and water usage. But unfortunately, this can prevent clients and other stakeholders from developing a holistic view of how the portfolio's holdings interact with the world around them. This conventional approach can also focus your attention on data that is easily comparable and readily available, which overlooks much of the nuance of a deeper analysis.</p>
<p>Our approach has downsides too. It's more unwieldy than a slick infographic, short on portfolio-level statistics, and long on my own exposition. We are always looking to refine and improve our approach to this, so I hope you'll <a href="https://app.precisefp.com/w/ixj9du">share your thoughts</a> with us on how we can do better.</p>
<h3 id="whats-in-this-strategy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#whats-in-this-strategy">What's In This Strategy?</a></h3>
<p>We think of the holdings in our flagship <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">Global Opportunity</a> strategy as belonging to one of four verticals: Infrastructure, Innovation, Lending, and Real Estate.</p>
<p>The criteria for each is relatively straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real Estate companies generate revenue through the sale and rental of real estate,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure holdings generate revenue directly from a fixed physical asset or by selling goods and services to the operators of those assets,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation holdings generate revenue through novel products or business practices, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lending companies generate revenue by charging interest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Relative to our benchmark (The MSCI ACWI), we remain significantly underweight non-us companies at the moment, with roughly 78% of our overall holdings domiciled in the United States.</p>
<p>We are also significantly overweight Real Estate, Industrials, and Financial Services stocks, and have no current positions in the Basic Materials, Energy, Healthcare or Utilities Sectors, which are roughly 22% of our index.</p>
<p>The strategy's historical performance is shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/CleanShot-2024-06-03-at-12.28.22@2x-1-1024x515.png"/></p>
<h3 id="inside-the-verticals"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#inside-the-verticals">Inside the Verticals</a></h3>
<p>Breaking our portfolio down by industry verticals is helpful when analyzing our strategy. The table below shows some summary statistics for each of these four components, as well as their weight within the strategy overall.</p>
<p>Our focus on companies with solid business models that generate free cash flow is immediately evident from this comparison. Our strategy has more than three times the ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of its benchmark, which indicates that our holdings are extremely well-placed to make strategic investments or return capital to shareholders over the coming years.</p>
<p>Trading at roughly 60 times earnings, our Real Estate vertical might seem richly valued at first glance. We believe that current accounting earnings are not the best indicator of value for these asset-based businesses, especially in the midst of structural headwinds for the real estate industry. Our holdings are extremely well-positioned with high occupancy rates, deeply integrated into their local communities, and have been weathering the industry's recent stresses with aplomb.</p>
<p>We continue to see opportunity in each of our verticals, and our due diligence pipeline is full of high-impact lenders, innovative companies with misunderstood opportunity sets, and infrastructure investments that should benefit from significant secular tailwinds.</p>

| Vertical | Weighting | **Dividend Yield** | **PE Ratio** | **5 Year Revenue CAGR** | **FCF/Market Cap** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

<h3 id="top-5-holdings"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#top-5-holdings">Top 5 Holdings</a></h3>
<p>The following five companies were the largest positions. These five positions comprised 42% of our overall holdings in this strategy as of June 3rd, 2024.</p>
<h4 id="agricultural-mortgage-corporation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#agricultural-mortgage-corporation">Agricultural Mortgage Corporation</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Lending</p>
<p>Known as Farmer Mac, this Washington D.C. based lender is a remarkable example of impact in action. Its core purpose is to increase the availability of long-term credit at stable interest rates for America's rural communities.</p>
<p>The company estimates that farmers and ranchers invest $2 locally for every dollar they save on interest expenses, which means the company's impact reaches deep into areas of the country that are just plain difficult to access.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the company is focused on growing its portfolio of loans to rural electricity cooperatives, which is a profound opportunity to compound their impact over time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Farmer Mac's core financial equation is a thing of beauty. They have delivered consistent returns on equity in the high teens, and more than 90% of their revenue is recurring. On top of that, the company is well placed to serve growth markets in renewable energy, fund investments that will be necessary to increase agricultural sustainability and productivity, and deepen the resilience of our agricultural system.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="alexandria-real-estate"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#alexandria-real-estate">Alexandria Real Estate</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Real Estate</p>
<p>This Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is focused on creating and maintaining the mission-critical lab space that innovative biotechnology companies require to develop life-changing therapies.</p>
<p>It was the first REIT to adopt this focus, and roughly three-quarters of its annual revenue comes from "clusters" of market-leading lab space in key centers of pharmaceutical R&amp;D like Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, and North Carolina's Research Triangle.</p>
<p>The company's tenants were responsible for 50% of novel FDA-approved therapies in the ten years ending 2023, which is nothing if not profound impact. And to our nerdy delight, the company has won numerous awards for the quality of its disclosures and financial reports in that period as well.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-2-1024x336.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Office real estate is in the doldrums at the moment, but lab space is uniquely insulated from the industry's high-level challenges because the work that happens inside of them can't generally be done from home. The company's revenues and cash flows are growing at healthy double-digit margins, but we have been able to purchase stock at valuations unseen since the financial crisis while other investors have been fleeing the industry.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="duolingo"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#duolingo">Duolingo</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>Duolingo's mission is to provide a private tutor experience to everyone on the planet through technology. Initially focused on just language learning, they have expanded their focus to include math and music in recent years.</p>
<p>Each of these areas unlocks significant economic opportunity for the learners that participate in them. Learning a new language is arguably the single most effective way to enable an individual to improve their economic situation since communication is necessary for most forms of high value work.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the company has used its power in the language learning market to introduce a new, lower cost, and more accessible language assessment test which is displacing the legacy Test of English as a Foreign Language, or TOEFL, which is a profound additional benefit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-6-1024x576.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Duolingo is a longstanding market leader in commercializing AI for public benefit, but it has recently come under assault from short sellers after supposedly competing translation products were unveiled by OpenAI and others. We think the threats are overblown: the company's learning system is extremely difficult to replicate, has significant growth opportunities ahead of it, and has been consistently growing revenues at more than 40% a year.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="lemonade"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#lemonade">Lemonade</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>Lemonade is a public benefit corporation organized "to harness novel business models, technologies, and private-nonprofiit partnerships to deliver insurance products where charitable giving is a core feature."</p>
<p>That alone is profoundly innovative. But the company's management team has been incredibly creative in the way that they fund their growth plans, which adds another layer of wonderfulness to an already-exciting proposition.</p>
<p>The company's insurance products have industry-leading net promoter scores around 70, and operate closer to breakeven than most insurance industry analysts tend to recognize. As their core demographic ages, we expect they will come back to Lemonade again and again.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/122-1225602_image-lemonade-insurance-logo-hd-png-download.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Lemonade is well capitalized with narrowing operating losses and annual revenue growth in excess of 40%. The next two years of growth should have remarkable implications for its bottom line as the company expands past breakeven, and we were able to buy in at a fifth of their IPO price.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="crocs"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-right-now-and-why/#crocs">Crocs</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>This manufacturer of comfy clogs has been dismissed as a fad every year since they IPO'd back in 2006. But a look past the surface reveals an immensely innovative company that has consistently iterated on their core design to create something that is somehow both trendy and timeless.</p>
<p>The company is also well on the way towards replacing the plastic in its shoes with renewable materials, and aims to reach 50% bio-based materials by 2030. They have also rolled out a recycling program that offers discounts on new shoes to those who participate.</p>
<p>On its own, that's not so impressive. But the company has made huge strides towards enshrining comfort and utility in our popular culture, which is a significant form of impact on its own.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-9-1024x687.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> The company took on a significant debt load after acquiring Heydude, a complementary footwear brand, in 2022. Though concerning, this hasn't hurt the company's solid global growth trajectory, with both brands exceeding estimates as of the most recent report. As they pay down debt and continue on their growth trajectory, we expect free cash flow to continue growing by 25% or more over the coming years.</p>

<h2 id="where-returns-came-from-in-2023"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/">Where Returns Came from in 2023</a></h2>
<p>Where are the returns coming from?</p>
<p>If I teach you nothing else, remember that question. It's one of the most important things you can ask as an investor. And if you keep asking it until you're blue in the face, you're all but guaranteed to learn something.</p>
<p>So let's look past our <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">flagship strategy's</a> handsome headline performance figure of 33.51% together.</p>
<p>The chart below shows all of the companies that we owned at one point in 2023 and their contributions to overall performance. We've used their ticker symbols in place of their names to save space. Companies that we don't own anymore as of 1/1/2024 are denoted with an asterix (*).</p>
<p>One more note before we get into this: I'm mostly talking about financial returns in this piece. A supplemental piece where we talk about the real-world impact each company generates will follow shortly.</p>
<p><img alt="Image showing the return contribution by stock of the Global Opportunities strategy in 2023" src="images/2023-Return-Attribution-Global-Opportunities-1024x466.png"/></p>
<p>I'll briefly discuss the top five contributors and detractors from performance before comparing our performance with our index.</p>
<h4 id="top-5-detractors-from-2023-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#top-5-detractors-from-2023-performance">Top 5 Detractors from 2023 Performance</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enphase (ENPH)</strong> was our single largest detractor from performance, which you might expect from a stock that was down roughly 50% in 2023. The solar power industry as a whole was a poor performer in 2023 thanks to changes in California's net metering laws that substantially reduced the industry's sales momentum. But we believe great businesses are built in downturns like these, and as long-term investors we have complete confidence in the management team led by the indefatigable Badri Kothandraraman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crocs (CROX)</strong> was the second-largest detractor from performance after momentum slowed at Heydude, a footwear brand it acquired in early 2022. This has produced a degree of financial indigestion as markets struggled to make sense of what to expect from the newly combined entity. We reduced our position during the year and cannot profess blind faith in the management team. With that said, we believe shares offer compelling value at the moment, with a ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of roughly 15%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alexandria Real Estate (ARE)</strong> was the third-largest detractor from performance as the slowing commercial real estate market affected valuations of all companies included in commercial real estate indices. But Alexandria's hyper-specialized business of providing lab space to innovative biotechnology companies can hardly be thought of as similar to mainstream commercial office buildings. We are willing to wait until the market recognizes this firm's value, and expect to be paid handsomely in the form of dividends, reinvested cash flow, and price appreciation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>American Tower Corporation (AMT)</strong> We exited this position on concerns that liabilities associated with the lead cables used to connect their cellular towers to their networks were not fully contained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HDFC Bank</strong> <strong>(HDB)</strong> This bellwether bank has significantly lagged behind the rest of the Indian stock market as it digests a complex merger process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="top-5-contributors-to-2023-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#top-5-contributors-to-2023-performance">Top 5 Contributors to 2023 Performance</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Farmer Mac (AGM)</strong> It's appropriate that our single largest position since inception would be the single greatest contributor to our portfolio's performance. Much of the reasoning <a href="https://investvegan.org/why-we-own-farmer-mac/">we shared back in January 2022</a> remains unchanged, and we have grown the position since that post to almost 15% of our ethical growth strategy. As a portfolio manager, one of my largest fears is that the market will come to recognize the value of this unique company before I can buy even more of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Duolingo (DUOL)</strong> The market afforded us the opportunity to buy into this remarkably impactful firm at a discount to its IPO price, and we did so in size. In the ensuing months, an old-school bubble in everything and anything vaguely linked to AI took hold, and the price appreciated significantly. We're no longer holding quite as many shares of this firm. But we challenge anyone to watch CEO <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration">Luis Von Ahn's 2011 TED talk</a> on the thesis for Duolingo and walk away anything but inspired and excited. Today, shares are only about 70% above their summer 2021 IPO price, and the company continues to grow revenues at a remarkably stable 40% a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TopBuild (BLD)</strong> I can't help but smile every time I think of this position, which we've held since the strategy's inception. In 2022, market prognosticators were calling for a recession, which cut the price of this insulation distributor down to half the current level because sales of insulation products are broadly seen as tied to the housing cycle. But the compelling operational footprint that this company has carefully assembled over decades combined with the real-world cost savings that good insulation offers building owners to create a wonderful financial equation as they thoughtfully consolidate their industry over the coming decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E.L.F. Beauty (ELF)</strong> This company needs no introduction for any makeup users reading this piece. They produce cruelty-free competitors to costly beauty staples at a remarkable clip, and are experiencing accelerating revenue growth as they penetrate deeper into traditional sales channels while retaining an ironclad hold on gen-z and cost-conscious consumers. The only reason it's not a larger position in our portfolios is that <a href="https://investvegan.org/our-process/">our process</a> requires us to be mindful of valuation, and the company is regularly in the most expensive decile across a range of metrics. With that said, we're likely to be shareholders for many years to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quanta Services (PWR)</strong> This company has a commanding position in infrastructure services, which includes renewable energy, communications, pipeline maintenance, and almost everything related to the electrical grid. Their approach to safety has long captivated me, and the company has been a prime beneficiary of the federal government's infrastructure spending. With a sales backlog that may be larger than their $30 billion market capitalization by now, this company is profoundly well prepared for whatever future may come.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="comparison-with-our-index"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#comparison-with-our-index">Comparison with our Index</a></h4>
<p>On the face of things, we substantially outperformed our index last year.</p>
<p>That's relatively simple to establish: The Ethical Growth strategy's 33.51% return was larger than the MSCI ACWI's 22.27% return.</p>
<p>But it's also not the most complete analysis, since many of the largest contributors to the index's returns are excluded from all of our strategies for ethical reasons. These are companies like Amazon, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nestle, Exxon, and McDonald's that generate profits for their shareholders at great cost to the rest of us.</p>
<p>To facilitate a better comparison, I cross-referenced my attribution of the MSCI ACWI's returns with our proprietary ethical exclusions library to produce the chart below. It shows that applying the same ethical exclusions to our index would have reduced the index's return to less than 15%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/2023-Benchmark-Comparison-Global-Opportunities.png"/></p>
<p>This mostly serves as a reminder that there's more to portfolio management than just removing companies with sketchy practices from your portfolio.</p>
<p>Many investment firms will represent that they are able to take your ethical criteria and apply them to portfolio management, but it's not enough to simply eliminate the companies that act badly. For best results, you need a team that is willing to truly inhabit the restricted universe that your ethics imply.</p>
<p>I'm grateful that many of you have chosen us to perform that work for you, and look forward to doing it for many years to come.</p>

<p>I feel for the many corporate directors and executives that are trying to chart a credible path towards net zero.</p>
<p>Best intentions, board-level buy in, and a big budget aren't enough to do the kind of deep decarbonization work that's necessary. And I'll eat a shoe if anyone can prove to me that all three of those conditions are present at even a plurality of corporations.</p>
<p>So what's a well-meaning manager to do?</p>
<p>In the conversations I've had with executives at the companies in our portfolio over the past year, I get the sense that there's a lack of useful guidance about what moving towards net zero actually looks like. As a practical matter, almost all of them probably assume that they need to start by hiring consultants to build a detailed estimate of their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.</p>
<p>And like, sure. That's a step.</p>
<p><strong>But it's the opposite of a functional understanding.</strong> Think about it: there's nothing wrong with hiring consultants, but it's a literal cry for help. And there are real limits to the contributions that third parties can make to something as central to long-term strategy as decarbonization.</p>
<p>So I've decided to clarify how we understand the problem, the sorts of corporate actions that matter to us, and where we see the biggest opportunities for near-term progress.</p>
<p>Whether you're considering investing in one of our strategies, wondering how to get your company on the right path, or just hoping to get your hands around the problem, I hope you'll let us know how we can make this more useful to you by leaving a public comment or sending us a private note.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-you-learned-recently"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-have-you-learned-recently">What Have You Learned Recently?</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/#overview-section-2">fifth National Climate Assessment</a> that was recently delivered to congress estimates that extreme weather events already cost the United States $150 Billion each year. That figure doesn't account for loss of life, healthcare costs, damages to ecosystem services, or what's happening in the other 194 countries on the planet.</p>
<p>Our black, brown, and indigenous siblings will doubtless experience the worst of this. But I also expect the direct costs of climate change to permanently kill the vibes in more than a handful of boardrooms. Uneven, extreme, and unpredictable changes always seem to catch at least a handful of companies unprepared.</p>
<p>The traditional corporate playbook has been to claim that such risks are well controlled.</p>
<p><strong>I categorically reject such claims</strong>. What I want instead (and consider to be table stakes) is a publicly available discussion of how a company has improved their understanding and control of these risks at least once a year for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>My favorite leaders already approach this conversation with humility, vulnerability, and candor. In the coming years, I hope they'll start to feel comfortable doing that in public.</p>
<p>And I'll never need another Christmas present if they start to normalize practices like sharing new words they've learned, exposing things they've gotten wrong, and asking for help or insight from their stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="what-capacity-can-you-build-in-the-next-three-years"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-capacity-can-you-build-in-the-next-three-years">What Capacity Can You Build in the Next Three Years?</a></h3>
<p>It might not be entirely clear how to go about capacity-building, so here are a few things leaders ought to contemplate charging their teams with in roughly ascending order of ambition, complexity, and career risk.</p>
<h4 id="source-carbon-removals1"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#source-carbon-removals1"><strong>Source Carbon Removals</strong><a href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#8662e7de-0fbc-41b0-94f9-61b89d7d60d8">1</a></a></h4>
<p>If you're still doing the spewing, it's time to get started undoing.</p>
<p>The carbon removal market barely exists today, but every single one of the roughly 2,600 organizations with a <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/">science-based net zero target</a> is wholly reliant on it to actually reach their net zero goal. Why? Because it's not particularly likely that any complex organization can truly reach zero carbon emissions by just decarbonizing their operations.</p>
<p>What are Carbon Removals?</p>
<p>Carbon Removals refer to processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere and demonstrably keep it from being re-emitted for extremely long periods of time.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/p/SBTi-purchases-analysis">only 32 companies</a> with these commitments had actually bought carbon removals as of September 2023. And according to <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/">cdr.fyi</a>, only about 120,000 tonnes of carbon removal have ever been delivered.</p>
<p>If your company plans to eventually purchase carbon removals at some scale in order to meet your net zero goal, you should begin immediately. And if you do not plan to participate in the market, say so.</p>
<p>Many corporate executives will feel that if they participate in this market, they will be expected to cover each and every ton of carbon they emit immediately. This can turn a well-intentioned climate plan into a weird spreadsheet game that's more about scoring arbitrary carbon points than manifesting impact.</p>
<p>Save us all some trouble and skip that step for now.</p>
<p>Instead, acknowledge that this is a multi-decade process that will require new internal sourcing capacity, supplier relationships, and strategic planning. Focus on quality over quantity, and remember that you're entering a new market that you will likely participate in for a long time. This is a rare circumstance where bravely taking baby steps will count as leadership.</p>
<h4 id="strengthen-industry-standards"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#strengthen-industry-standards"><strong>Strengthen Industry Standards</strong></a></h4>
<p>Evaluate any professional associations that may be relevant to your industry, and ask whether they're currently issuing guidance on how members should adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>Is that guidance good enough? If not, why not?</p>
<p>Remember that there is power in networks. In uncertain times, strengthening the soft infrastructure that surrounds you and your colleagues can be hugely clarifying.</p>
<p>The intended goal isn't just to elevate the status of your own company but to influence industry standards on decarbonization as a whole. This can actually enrich the quality of your own strategy by sourcing incremental inputs from a larger professional network and decrease the career risk of climate action by building momentum and broader buy-in.</p>
<p>It may also be possible and appropriate to create industry-facing resources that discuss your company's environmental processes, failures, and successes. In time, this could create a shared repository of knowledge that other companies can refer to when bolstering their own practices.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting you spill any trade secrets here. Take a page from the software industry, where it's common practice for engineering organizations to write about how they approach complex problems. In many cases, firms will even create open-source infrastructure that others can use to tackle these same issues. Do the folks thinking about decarbonizing your fleets feel like they can publish their analysis of the current trade-offs? If not, why not?</p>
<p>Lastly, take a long hard look at your lobbying activity. Are you advocating for stricter environmental regulations? I think you should be. This probably seems short-sighted, idealistic, and insane to some readers, but consider that it will also concretize the costs of credible climate action and build them into the cost projections of every major actor in your industry.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-your-stakeholders-saying"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-are-your-stakeholders-saying">What Are Your Stakeholders Saying?</a></h3>
<p>Credible plans are intrinsically unique. Every business has its own ethos, targets, and constraints, and so should every climate action plan.</p>
<p>Done right, this won't create conflict between your company's idiosyncratic approach and the reporting required by the folks who oversee the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/">science-based targets</a> initiative. Instead, it will help translate the long-term ambitions you've committed to into shorter-term steps and tangible decarbonization progress.</p>
<p>Effective climate action will unfold in a dynamic process that responds to changes in technology, regulation, community needs, and your company's practical circumstances. Don't make the mistake of carving your approach in stone. Instead, celebrate what you've learned by sharing how and why your approach has evolved.</p>
<p>I love it when managers directly cite stakeholder feedback as the root cause for these sorts of updates.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It's straightforward: mainstream investors have been conditioned to care about ESG disclosures because they contain useful hints about whether a company is capable of considering and controlling risk holistically. The quality, diversity, and frequency of your stakeholder communications are the main mechanism that such considerations manifest through.</p>
<p>So instead of spending all of your time on the outlook for next quarter or next year, think about ways to give us direct visibility into how you manage those relationships.</p>
<p>It might be uncomfortable in the short term, but that's something we'll all have to get used to. Because even though there's material uncertainty in the path climate change will take, there is no reasonable projection that could be described as "comfortable."</p>

<h2 id="why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/">Why ESG Investing Has Been Such a Letdown</a></h2>
<p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing has gotten a lot of attention in recent years, as the promise of aligning portfolios with ethical values gained mainstream recognition.</p>
<p>But it's long past time to wonder whether it deserves all the hype.</p>
<p>Despite the promises of real-world impact, glossy brochures with pictures of solar panels on them, and a substantial weight of evidence indicating that these data can help mitigate financial risk if properly applied, the truth is that ESG investing often fails to deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>To help our clients, their friends, and the broader world make sense of this, we decided to explore some of the limitations of ESG data and discuss why it falls short of what individual investors tend to expect from it.</p>
<h3 id="the-illusion-created-by-esg-ratings"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#the-illusion-created-by-esg-ratings"><strong>The Illusion Created By ESG Ratings</strong></a></h3>
<p>One of the troubling aspects of ESG investing is the high ratings given to extractive businesses that are known for their negative impact on the environment and society.</p>
<p>Take Nestle, for example, a company that is almost synonymous with corporate greed to many of our clients and readers. Surprisingly, many ESG rating firms rate Nestle near-perfect, raising serious questions for me and many others about the validity and reliability of these ratings.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean the whole practice is worthless. Investment professionals are supposed to act with independence and objectivity for good reason: there are countless examples throughout history of rating agencies failing to properly perform their duties. One of the most notable is extremely recent: the "great recession" of 2008-9 was in part precipitated by rating agencies issuing inflated assessments of low-quality mortgage assets.</p>
<p>In reality, any investor worth entrusting your hard-earned dollars to ought to understand that it's unrealistic to wholly outsource investment decisionmaking to some scoring rubric or process.</p>
<h3 id="the-inherent-limitations-of-esg-data-and-all-data-for-that-matter"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#the-inherent-limitations-of-esg-data-and-all-data-for-that-matter"><strong>The Inherent Limitations of ESG Data... and all Data for that Matter.</strong></a></h3>
<p>Investment decision-making is fundamentally about making do with incomplete information.</p>
<p>Even if we were able to use these data to create accurate assessments of corporate alignment with social good, other data gaps would inevitably emerge in a thorough analysis.</p>
<p>At a certain level, there are just natural limits to what can be known.</p>
<p>Here's a somewhat personal example: I'm a transgender woman. And even though we pick the management teams and companies that we invest in with extremely carefully, I still assume that at least one (and likely more) of the super-sustainable companies in our portfolio is led by someone who believes I shouldn't be allowed to use an indoor bathroom.</p>
<p>That's largely why ESG data is geared towards anticipating and avoiding certain risks rather than driving impact or justice: financial risk is plain easier to estimate.</p>
<p>Think about it: If a company depletes water sources near its production facility that it relies on to create its product, it naturally follows that the firm will either pay punitive fees to source the stuff or experience a production slowdown. Both of these circumstances would result in foreseeable declines in revenue that a forward-looking investment strategy might well be able to profit from.</p>
<h3 id="disaggregating-vague-build-a-better-world-value-propositions-in-esg"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#disaggregating-vague-build-a-better-world-value-propositions-in-esg"><strong>Disaggregating Vague "Build a Better World" Value Propositions In ESG</strong></a></h3>
<p>In a recent webinar, I shared a stylized hierarchy of value propositions for sustainable investing with the assembled group. If you'd like to access that full discussion just click the image below. But give it a gander in any case, because I want to tell you a few things about it.</p>
<p><img alt='A stylized heirarchy of "better world" value propositions showing impact at the top of the pyramid, ' src="images/CleanShot-2024-05-23-at-17.13.22.png"/></p>
<p>At a high level, the premise of this chart is that the vague idea of "aligning with a more sustainable future" can be broken up into four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing externalities</strong>. This is the most basic reason that ESG (and the associated data) are important. Having access to information about the composition of a company's workforce, the carbon intensity of its operations, and the long-term planning processes it uses to prepare for a range of possible futures helps us know that their operations are not creating negative consequences for surrounding communities. Crucially, this can also help us gain confidence that the company is insulated from negative surprises, which goes a long way towards mitigating risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aligning with growth trends.</strong> Any version of "building a better world" includes building new tools, technologies, and infrastructure. And whether we're talking about safe housing for seniors, scaling renewable energy generation, or building better software for teachers, paying careful attention to what the world needs is a big help when designing investment portfolios. As analysts, we're able to work backwards from what's needed, identify large growth opportunities, and then ensure we own companies that are well-placed to meet those needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding stranded assets</strong>. As climate change unfolds and humanity reacts to it, substantial disruptions in financial markets are all but certain to emerge. These will never be entirely avoidable, but they are somewhat forseeable. Take the case of fossil fuels, which will hopefully be substantially less widely used sometime in the next couple of decades. The financial think tank Carbon Tracker estimates that <a href="https://carbontracker.org/investors-need-to-look-carefully-at-stranded-asset-risks/">$1 trillion of oil and gas assets are at serious risk of becoming worthless</a> as a result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Driving real-world impact</strong>. This is what most people think of when "sustainable investing" comes up. It's difficult to deliver and even more difficult to quantify, which has left many people with false understandings of what's possible. With that said, all of the strategies we manage seek to avoid preventable harm to living things while also contributing to positive real-world outcomes. With that said, we do our best to learn from the industry's past mistakes when discussing this with our clients, and will always seek to underpromise and over-deliver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these four components of "building a better world" is worth thinking about in isolation, but as a practical matter it's worth remembering that we pursue them is all at once. There is a substantial difference between driving positive change in the real world and protecting your hard-earned dollars, but we pursue them all at the same time as part of an integrated process.</p>
<h3 id="reasonable-expectations-the-key-to-satisfaction"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#reasonable-expectations-the-key-to-satisfaction"><strong>Reasonable Expectations: The Key to Satisfaction</strong></a></h3>
<p>We focus on making sure that our clients have reasonable expectations about what to expect from the funds they entrust to us. That work is not just about the sustainability characteristics of the portfolios we design for them, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Helping current and prospective clients reach evidence-based understandings of <a href="https://investvegan.org/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect/">what returns they should expect from their portfolios</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding <a href="https://investvegan.org/gimmewebinar">regular webinars</a> dedicated to answering any question on the minds of our clients and broader community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a disciplined approach to growth, which includes ensuring that our <a href="https://investvegan.org/support/">support</a> resources are sophisticated enough to serve as a real-time resource for client issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At a high level, the attention we've paid to all of the holistic considerations above is meant to help you understand whether it makes sense to involve this firm in your life for the long-term. We think of ourselves as your purpose-built partner for long term investing, and would love the chance to demonstrate what that means.</p>

<h2 id="seek-perfection-elsewhere"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/07/26/seek-perfection-elsewhere/">Seek Perfection Elsewhere</a></h2>
<p>In conversation with many of you over the past few weeks, I've found myself repeating the phrase "it's unrealistic to commit to ethical perfection."</p>
<p>Given that I manage an "ethical growth" strategy and an "ethics-first" investment firm, this statement bears some explanation.</p>
<p>We invest in public markets, which typically reflect the latent desires of the wealthiest folks on the planet.</p>
<p>Overseeing our investments in such circumstances requires a commitment to creative thinking, deep research, and continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Or, to put it another way... it requires one heck of a bullshit detector.</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few quick examples of things we find regularly while examining companies that have been lauded as harbingers of a happier future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boardrooms full of billionaire buddies in their "third wife" era,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's just say "Epstein ties," and saddest of all:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams with earnest commitment to driving positive impact, but extremely slim chances of doing so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It drives me crazy to see companies like this bundled together, branded as something like the "transformative climate innovation fund," and marketed to people like you.</p>
<p>This happens because once Wall Street realized that millions of kind people actually cared about participating in the construction of a better future for the planet, the marketing machine took over.</p>
<p>At that point, it became inevitable that dreck, dross, and douchebags would pervade the sustainable investing landscape in the way they do today.</p>
<p><strong>So what can we do about it?</strong></p>
<p>I know for sure that step one is simple: refuse to make stupid promises.</p>
<p>But as far as I can tell, step two never ends.</p>
<p>That's the part where we wade through all of the grey areas, moral ambiguities, and intentional misdirections that characterize modern capitalism while keeping our moral compass intact.</p>
<p>What I hope to do in the coming weeks is start doing step three alongside it, which is where we begin giving more regular, direct, and detailed downloads on the things we've learned while working through our process each lunar cycle.</p>
<p>I hope you'll join us for our first full moon webinar this coming August 1st at 1pm. If you <a href="https://investvegan.org/gimmewebinar">click here to register</a>, you can even join the conversation directly and ask whatever questions are on your mind.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could deliver ethical perfection. But in its absence, I hope that more regular doses of our honest perspectives will suffice.</p>
