<p>Many of our clients have significant charitable goals. This is a very heart-forward, mission-driven organization, so it makes a lot of sense that the people in our community are actively pushing positive change in multiple ways.</p>
<p>We're not able to offer the same depth of insight on charitable donations as we are with investment management, but thought we ought to share some resources to make this process a little less mysterious. After all, if you're in the early stages of forming your giving plan, it can be downright intimidating to get started.</p>
<p>Giving is best understood as a continuous practice, not a one-time check writing extravaganza. The most effective donors tend to view it as something they try to get better at over time, and often develop an intensely personal sense of what matters.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind as you read through these resources, and remember that perfection is an unrealistic goal. With that said, incremental improvements in the way you approach charitable giving can compound into outrageous real-world impact over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To start, <a href="https://www.cafonline.org/my-personal-giving/long-term-giving/giving-guide">this comprehensive guide</a> from Charities Aid Foundation highlights the three key considerations when embarking on your journey of charitable giving. It's followed by some excellent deeper-level articles <a href="https://www.cafonline.org/my-personal-giving/long-term-giving/evidence-vs-impact-finding-evidence">like this one</a>, which dives into measuring impact through evidence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping with the theme of general guides, <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/money/money-planning/charitable-donations-giving">this article</a> also provides some insight into the key questions that donors will need to ponder over. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington Secretary of State published an <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/corporations-charities/nonprofits-charities/info-donors/frequently-asked-questions-donors#2">informational page</a> on navigating the many organizations you can donate to - there are several thought-provoking FAQs here, contemplating ideas such as what percentage of donations a charity should actually put toward it's cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I personally love <a href="https://www.unitedway.org/our-impact/work/giving-old/guide-to-charitable-giving/">this piece from United Way</a> because it discusses the notion of viewing your donation as an investment. They also offer several "red flags" to be wary of when vetting the organizations you give to. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of examining the plethora of organizations out there, <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/">Charity Watch</a> is a hub full of resources for determining which groups are on the up-and-up (and which aren't). Here you can find a <em>ton</em> of information on specific charities A-Z. <a href="https://give.org/">Give.org</a> and <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/">Guidestar</a> can also be used alongside Charity Watch to form a comprehensive analysis and source different charities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you've dialed in on the specific charities you're interested in giving to, you can also use Charity Watch to sharpen your general knowledge, as they also share interesting bits on things like <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/charity-donating-articles/4-reasons-why-automated-charity-ratings-are-unreliable">why automated ratings are unreliable.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/08/25/can-the-financial-industry-help-save-the-environment/">In this piece</a>, our very own Sloane discusses the parallels between business and finance and solving social problems with Mark Tercek, investment banker turned CEO of Nature Conservancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/04/20/maximizing-your-philanthropic-impact/">in a conversation between Sloane and Eric Friedman, CFA</a>, we again learn about the importance of evidence in measuring impact. I found it absolutely fascinating (and relevant) how Eric drew comparisons between the amount of evidence present and the level of risk surrounding a giving opportunity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We truly hope you enjoy going through these materials, and that they provide some guidance in your journey. </p>
<p>We're always delighted to speak with you, so if you'd like to further discuss this (or whatever else may be on your mind), <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">please feel free to book some time.</a></p>

<h2 id="do-you-need-diversification"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/">Do You Need Diversification?</a></h2>
<p>There are few financial concepts as fundamental as diversification, but most of the people I speak with can't really begin to understand what it means or why they might need it.</p>
<p>I get it! This stuff isn't exactly intuitive.</p>
<p>At a high level, diversification is a way to control the level of risk in an investment portfolio. But I want to give you a functional understanding of this concept, so let's talk through an example.</p>
<p>Imagine for a second that your portfolio is composed of just a single stock. When that stock goes up, so does the value of your portfolio. But that dynamic also works in the other direction, which is not particularly desirable.</p>
<h5 id="diversifications-definite-benefit"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/#diversifications-definite-benefit"><strong>Diversification's Definite Benefit</strong></a></h5>
<p>We can clearly see the benefits of diversification when we add a second stock to the portfolio.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Stock 1</strong></th>
<th><strong>Stock 2</strong></th>
<th><strong>Portfolio</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>+1%</td>
<td>-1%</td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The first stock is up and the other is down, which means the value of the overall portfolio remains unchanged.</p>
<p>In practice, we rarely come across examples like this, because even though the two stocks may have fundamentally different characteristics, most of them perform similarly over short time periods. Diversification is excellent at ensuring that aberrant performance from any one stock - sometimes referred to as "idiosyncratic risk" - doesn't detract too much from the performance of the overall portfolio.</p>
<p>But this protection has a limit.</p>
<p>That's because some of the risk of investing in stocks is "systematic," which is a fancy way of saying that it's related more to financial conditions in the broad economy than the details of any particular company. Increasing the number of holdings in a portfolio cannot protect an investor from these systematic risks.</p>
<p>So if we imagine that the company behind Stock 1 is embroiled in a value-destroying scandal, it's clear that an investor in a diversified portfolio would have a better experience than one that owned just that one company. But in the case of broader economic issues, all of the companies might wind up being affected similarly.</p>
<h5 id="diversifications-diminishing-value"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/#diversifications-diminishing-value"><strong>Diversification's Diminishing Value</strong></a></h5>
<p>You don't need a PhD in finance to realize that diversification can only provide a certain amount of protection.</p>
<p>The chart below shows that this benefit actually declines with each incremental stock that you add. So there's a massive benefit from moving to something more diversified from a one-stock portfolio. But there's no sense in just swallowing up every stock you can get your hands on in the name of diversification.</p>

<p>The chart above shows that there's still significant incremental value in diversification until one's portfolio holds more than a hundred stocks. But our flagship <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">flagship strategy</a> strategy only has about twenty stocks in it.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<h5 id="diversifications-drawbacks"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/#diversifications-drawbacks">Diversification's Drawbacks</a></h5>
<p>For investment strategies like ours, which are predicated on strong <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-investment-beliefs-and-competitive-advantages/">investment beliefs</a> and require a significant amount of fundamental research, diversification can be almost synonymous with value destruction unless it is managed incredibly carefully.</p>
<p>This concept is not particularly intuitive to people who haven't spent their literal entire lives thinking about how to manage money ethically, so let me walk you through it in some depth.</p>
<p>In order to make it into our investment portfolio, a company must satisfy every step in our <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">investment process</a>. This includes a deep dive into the ethical concerns surrounding their products and conduct as well as a close examination of their financial prospects. So in effect, the composition and design of our flagship strategy is a response to practical constraints. We simply aren't able to identify and monitor 100 companies that we think our clients ought to own.</p>
<p>Again, remember that diversification is just one way to manage risk.</p>
<p>The careful research we do also serves to significantly mitigate investment risk. Absurd or adverse consequences could result if we were to begin buying every ethical-sounding business that's publicly traded. The extent to which this is true has really surprised me, and I wrote <a href="https://ethicic.com/how-i-became-an-active-manager/">an essay</a> a few months ago describing my intellectual evolution to this point which may be of interest to those who find this topic fascinating.</p>
<p>But I suspect the majority of our clients and community members are just trying to make a decision between a diversified portfolio and a more concentrated approach. So let's steer right into those questions.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-want-a-diversified-portfolio-or-a-concentrated-one"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/06/14/do-you-need-diversification/#do-you-want-a-diversified-portfolio-or-a-concentrated-one">Do You Want a Diversified Portfolio or a Concentrated one?</a></h5>
<p>There's no perfect answer, but I can definitely help you peer inside of the way we manage portfolios here to identify what's most important to you.</p>
<p>In the table below, I've enumerated several considerations that are relevant to clients choosing between our <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">Global Opportunities</a> strategy and the <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/core-portfolio-collection/">more diversified portfolios</a> that we customize for their specific needs.</p>
<p>To do this, we add external ETFs and mutual funds with aligned oversight practices. This allows us to broaden a client's portfolio without diluting our other strategies, and can create a more balanced portfolio.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks, so here is a table that can help you compare the two on three high-level criteria.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">Global Opportunities</a></th>
<th><a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/core-portfolio-collection/">Core Portfolio Collection</a></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ethics</td>
<td>All research and oversight are directly overseen by me, meaning we can manage ethical concerns with unusual precision.</td>
<td>A portion of portfolios are managed by research teams at other firms. All of them have strong processes that align with our own, but we have significantly less control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Predictability</td>
<td>Month-to-month performance will be more volatile, and may diverge from popular stock indices for long periods of time.</td>
<td>Performance is still inherently volatile (it's the stock market, after all) but is likely to be more similar to popular stock indices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>All research and portfolio management is included in our standard fee.</td>
<td>Additional fund-level costs (which vary) are imposed by the Mutual Funds and ETFs selected to add diversification. We do not receive any of these fees.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>With all this said, I'd be a silly goose if I didn't mention that there's no reason to navigate this alone.</p>
<p>If you've read this far and still aren't sure which path is more appealing, you should probably <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">reach out</a>. We love helping kind people design investment strategies that help them maximize the probability of realizing their financial goals, so please don't hesitate to use us as a resource.</p>

<h2 id="our-investment-beliefs"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/05/30/our-investment-beliefs/">Our Investment Beliefs</a></h2>
<p>Our investment beliefs spring straight from our mission, pervade our process, and help us pursue safe passage through the perpetually uncertain investment landscape.</p>
<p>In that sense, they serve as a foundation for our long-term investment goals while ensuring that we make consistent investment decisions that mitigate risk, manifest impact, and maximize the long-term stability of our portfolios.</p>
<p>We believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Active management is the only way to effectively fulfil an ethics-first investment mandate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses associated with preventable harm to living things are identifiable, avoidable, and likely to underachieve over long time horizons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creative synthesis of ethical and fundamental data uncovers opportunities to align capital with companies as they compound their contributions to society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embedded controls to promote long-term thinking and analysis are a necessary precondition for delivering acceptable results over multiple economic cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focused, high-conviction portfolios are superior to more diversified alternatives for long-term investors with an ability to deeply understand each underlying asset. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be difficult to avoid delivering differentiated results to our clients over time if we stay true to these beliefs.</p>
<p>Our unique approach to long-term investing, ethical screening, and integration of diverse viewpoints places <a href="https://investvegan.org/our-process/">our research process</a> significantly outside the norm.</p>
<p>We see this fundamental strangeness as a sustainable competitive advantage, and have found that the individuals and institutions that are best suited to working with us tend to agree.</p>
<p>In addition to that, our principal competitive advantages come from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ethical alignment we share with our clients, which allows us to stay firm in our moral convictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our unique process, which embeds significant risk controls into our regular course of business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our long-term outlook, which allows us to look past day-to-day volatility with patience and confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our relationships with the investment community, which allow us to regularly access the skill and experience of collaborators outside our organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relentless focus on total portfolio outcomes, which allows us to remain focused on what actually matters to clients.</p>

<p>The stock market is... complicated.</p>
<p>But despite that, it is possible to construct useful understandings of how it behaves through careful study of its long-term performance.</p>
<p>Before we get into that though, let's make sure we share a functional understanding of what we're talking about. Feel free to skip ahead if things get a little too basic for you, but we want to make sure that everyone's able to follow along.</p>
<p>So let's start at the very beginning.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-stock"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#what-is-a-stock"><strong>What is a stock?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Happily, we have a euphonic case study that should help you understand this!</p>
<p>Consider Crocs, the rubber clog company.</p>
<p>At some point in their history, the founders realized that they needed more money in order to manufacture their products. This is a very common situation and can happen to any company whether it's small or large.</p>
<p>Crocs' financial position is summarized by something called a balance sheet, which records all of its assets and liabilities at a given point in time. Assets are things they own, like ideas, resources, or physical inventory, while liabilities are best understood as the way those assets are paid for.</p>
<p>As you might guess from the word "balance," the general idea of these reports is that both sides should sum to the same value. The table below might be a helpful representation of this if you happen to be visually inclined.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Assets</strong></th>
<th><strong>Liabilities</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tangible (Equipment, inventory, etc)</td>
<td>Borrowed money (mortgages, loans, bonds, etc)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intangible (Designs, copyrights, etc)</td>
<td>Equity (often synonymous with "stock")</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Investors are best understood as providers of capital to companies. We have two primary ways of charging the company to use our money: lending it to them through a loan or a bond and investing alongside them as stockholders.</p>
<h3 id="how-are-stocks-and-bonds-different"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#how-are-stocks-and-bonds-different"><strong>How are Stocks and Bonds Different?</strong></a></h3>
<p>The main difference between them is that the return on stock investments is vague and uncertain while the returns that lenders like bond investors experience are generally determined (or at least well described) by a contract.</p>
<p>If the company were to encounter financial hardship or - in an extreme (but illustrative) case - enter liquidation, bondholders would be significantly better protected from financial loss than their stockholder neighbors on the balance sheet. Bondholders generally receive the interest and principal payments they are owed before stockholders get anything in these sorts of adverse situations.</p>
<p>With that said, if the fortunes of the business were to improve, a bondholder's best case would be to get paid back in full. By contrast, stockholders would participate directly and proportionally in the improving fortunes of the company.</p>
<p>These stylized examples don't capture the full spectrum of how these securities interact, but they do convey a few things that are important for long-term investors to internalize:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can use both stocks and bonds to charge companies for the use of our money,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonds have a predetemined payoff, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stocks have an uncertain payoff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-a-stock-portfolio-typically-perform"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#how-does-a-stock-portfolio-typically-perform"><strong>How does a Stock Portfolio Typically Perform?</strong></a></h3>
<p>This is where the fun really begins!</p>
<p>As a practical matter, it is very difficult to forecast the future of any particular company with much precision. We may love our crocs (and be wearing them as we write this essay) but that doesn't mean we can see the company's future clearly.</p>
<p>But when we combine individual stocks into a well-constructed portfolio, things get much easier to predict. Imagine that you purchased shares in the S&amp;P 500 index, which is among the most widely used and studied indices, back in 1980. If you were to fall asleep for the next twenty years, you would probably have been very pleasantly surprised when you woke up and checked your brokerage statement.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of how good that surprise would be, we've excerpted the chart below from an excellent review of risk management practices published by Sloane's former colleagues at the CFA Institute Research Foundation. This shows the market's returns on a logarithmic scale, which shows exponential growth much more clearly than the linear charts you might be more familiar with.</p>
<p>You don't have to worry too much about those math words though: we've included this chart to convey that there is a clear pattern of gradual ascent in long-term stock returns. Just look how the line goes from bottom left to top right!</p>

<p>So, if stock market returns are historically consistent, why is the stock market risky?</p>
<p>One could easily write a PhD thesis on this topic, and many people have. It's complicated! But our goal in this essay is to leave you with a well-grounded understanding of how stocks behave, and it's possible to get there without resorting to pursuing a graduate degree.</p>
<p>If you look at the chart above, you can see that returns oscillated between flat and negative for more than a decade after the year 2000. The 1970s were similarly non-wonderful times to own stocks. These things have happened, and likely will happen again!</p>
<p>But the important thing to remember is that they also usually stop happening eventually. And when they do, stocks' long-term tendency to appreciate has historically returned in force. So there are significant practical rewards to adopting a patient posture that embraces this reality.</p>
<p>That's true in triplicate when you zoom in to consider what might happen in any given year. The chart below shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index - the same one we examined above - has declined an average of 14.3% at some point in each of the last 43 years.</p>
<p>Those declines are shown in red on the chart below, but they're only half of the story. The grey bars on the same chart show the returns for each full year. And despite some sort of decline occurring like clockwork every single year, the stock market managed to notch a positive performance almost three quarters of the time.</p>

<p>At this point, it's probably beginning to make a lot of sense why stocks are usually seen of the cornerstone of a long-term investment portfolio: if you can ignore, indulge, or otherwise plan for their volatility, they have an extremely well-documented tendency to turn money into more money.</p>
<p>We'll get back to bonds in a second, but before we go there, let's just lay out what we learned in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stocks go down at some point every single year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They still managed to finish the year up about 75% of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To capture these returns, stay invested!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But is this really all that different from the way bonds behave? After all, many people we talk to aren't particularly motivated by extracting every last iota of investment return from the market. They just want to live their lives with a reasonable sense that when they need money sometime in the future, there will be enough of it.</p>

<p>The book <em><a href="https://wsp.wharton.upenn.edu/book/stocks-for-the-long-run/">Stocks for the Long Run</a></em> by Wharton professor Jeremy J. Siegel is perhaps the most widely referenced study of long-term investment returns. It's worth a read for anyone serious about learning the craft of investing, but we bring it up here mostly because it also contains the excellent chart below.</p>

<p>This chart shows something remarkable in stark clarity: <strong>increasing our holding period decreases our range of outcomes.</strong></p>
<p>Over the period Siegel studied - which begins in 1802 - stock performance was extremely variable in the short term. An investor who held a diversified stock portfolio for one year at any point during those centuries might have experienced a gain as large as 67%, a decline as stark as 39%, or anything in between those two values.</p>
<p>But as we move our eyes across the chart to the right and examine a longer holding period, the difference between the best and worst return narrows significantly.</p>
<p>After thirty years, the difference between the best and worst annualized return was only about 8%. So even if you were to pick the literal worst time in the past two centuries to put money into the stock market, there is a strong statistical argument that you would come out ahead with enough patience, planning, and preparedness.</p>

<p>We hate to conclude a fact-laden exploration like this with uncertainty, but it bears mentioning that <strong>the way we invest is nothing if not unusual</strong>.</p>
<p>We are proud of this, and <strong>it's not going to change</strong>.</p>
<p>The people who are best suited to working with us are generally unsettled by the thought of investing in an index like the S&amp;P 500, which contains (among other things) many prolific carbon emitters, weapons manufacturers, and organizers of industrial-scale animal slaughter.</p>
<p>We'd rather be punched in the face than have any involvement with those activities.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, a lot of our time is spent trying to insulate the portfolios we manage from an ever-growing list of product and conduct-based issues. In our view, this is likely to mitigate risk and promote adherence to <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">our process</a>, which has remained remarkably consistent since Sloane founded this firm in 2021.</p>
<p>But again, <strong>we do things differently around here.</strong> If the thought of your portfolio behaving differently from your neighbor's is scary to you, it's likely you will be better off working with a different firm. If that thought makes you queasy, it's probably worth evaluating <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/">our strategies</a> or <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">reaching out to our team</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-inflation-mean-to-you"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/">What Does Inflation Mean to You?</a></h2>
<p>Inflation has been an obscure economic phenomenon for most of my life. There has been plenty of academic discussion, but it hasn't crossed over into mainstream economic and political discourse.</p>
<p>Until recently.</p>
<p>Pandemic-induced supply chain shocks have coupled with Russia's war of aggression and the associated volatility in world energy markets to put it front and center in "kitchen table" economic discussions.</p>
<p>Which is a polite way of saying that people are worried about it.</p>
<p>I can see why.</p>
<p>Traditionally, analysts ignore inflation in energy and food prices (which are quite volatile) and focus on "core inflation" which is designed to measure the other stuff in our day to day life. Things like medical care, apparel, education, and services.</p>
<p>As the chart below from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm">United States Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> shows, those prices have spiked after almost two decades of stability.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/12-month-percentage-chan-1024x761.png"/></p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>And more importantly, how can we expect it to manifest in the broader economy?</p>
<p>There is no shortage of scary stories about the ravages of inflation. Countries like Zimbabwe, Argentina, and Turkey have been indelibly shaped by it for most of the period shown in the chart above. We've heard of people who make a habit of going to the grocery store first thing in the morning because prices increase every afternoon and princes made into paupers by the mass devaluation of currency.</p>
<p>Is that what we have to look forward to?</p>
<p>At a high level, <strong>I don't think so.</strong></p>
<p>And I think that the general discussion about inflation in our economy has obscured some basic questions of fairness that should be of interest to anyone with a progressive political bent. But I want to make sure that we're all on the same page. So let's clarify some terms before we dive into what we can reasonably expect in the future.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#what-is-inflation">What is inflation?</a></h3>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines inflation as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not so complex! Prices up, value of money down. But a declining value of money doesn't exactly create warm and fuzzy feelings in anyone's hearts. Instead, it tends to create panic, since most people aren't used to thinking of the dollars in their wallet as something that fluctuates in value.</p>
<p>That's because unless you're sending money overseas, traveling, or making a big-ticket purchase from another country, fluctuations in the value of the dollar don't mean very much to you. They show up in the price of things you buy day-to-day, but generally speaking the fluctuations outside of food and energy prices are digested by the time they reach you that you barely perceive them.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-inflation-measured"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#how-is-inflation-measured">How is inflation measured?</a></h3>
<p>In the United States, the benchmark measure of inflation is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They've created a metric called the <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong>, which is designed to measure the prices that consumers pay for certain goods and services.</p>
<p>It's important to underline that we're talking about consumers as a whole here, not you in particular. For instance, vegans have generally been insulated by recent rises in the price of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. So our personal experiences of inflation may be quite different from what's described in the CPI.</p>
<p>That's doubly true for folks who live outside of big cities. The CPI is designed to measure price changes for urban consumers, and doesn't generally do a good job tracking the experiences of people in Rural America who often have lower incomes, greater day-to-day reliance on oil and gas, and labor markets that are slower to adjust for rising wages.</p>
<h3 id="is-inflation-good-or-bad"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#is-inflation-good-or-bad">Is inflation good or bad?</a></h3>
<p>Inflation is just one component of our economic ecosystem, which makes it difficult to analyze in isolation. With that said, many economic commentators have not hesitated to characterize it as a scourge. That's because it reduces the value of certain assets, like cash held in bank accounts, in a way that's quite scary to seniors and other folks who live on fixed incomes.</p>
<p>But it also creates jobs. It's not a coincidence that inflation is flaring up at the same time as the US unemployment rate is drawing closer to pre-pandemic levels. This relationship is so central to our economy that the US Federal Reserve's mandate is to promote both "maximum employment" and "stable prices."</p>
<p>This effectively acknowledges a direct link between the recent "great resignation" which has featured all sorts of employees leaving their jobs for better pay, more flexibility, or long-term career opportunities and the rise we've seen in inflation rates. One begets the other. So it would be quite difficult to issue an accurate blanket characterization of it as good or bad because at some level, it's both.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem to stop people.</p>
<p>There seems to be an army of right-wing zealots ready to pounce on every inflation-related datapoint in an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the long-term stability of our economy. In many cases, these pundits have been making the same case for years without regard to the evidence. And in my judgment, you would be well served by ignoring them. A well-diversified portfolio of stocks (such as the sort that we build for our clients) is widely seen as the best way to preserve the value of your wealth over long time horizons.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-relationship-between-debt-and-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#whats-the-relationship-between-debt-and-inflation">What's the relationship between debt and inflation?</a></h3>
<p>The mainstream discussion about inflation tends to overlook something crucial: many Americans are in significant amounts of debt. I'm talking less about mortgages here than credit cards, student loans, and medical debts that often come with high interest rates and target some of our poorest populations.</p>
<p>This probably doesn't come as news, since at this point almost everyone has a friend or loved one that has been touched by this personally. A recent <em>Liberty Street Economics</em> <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/11/uneven-distribution-of-household-debt-by-gender-race-and-education/">analysis</a> published by the New York Federal Reserve found that Black, Hispanic, and Female college graduates were much more likely than other graduates to still be carrying student loan debt at age thirty.</p>
<p>This means that those graduates effectively had their earnings reduced by the cost of carrying their student loan debt. And because inflation reduces the cost of paying back those debts, its recent rise may wind up reducing the burden that these borrowers are set to bear in the coming years.</p>
<p>Of course, it's nothing compared to just cancelling the loans outright or enacting broader-scale economic justice reforms. But we'll have to leave those topics for another time. Feel free to reach out to us if you don't feel like waiting, though.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-best-way-to-protect-my-assets-from-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#whats-the-best-way-to-protect-my-assets-from-inflation"><strong>What's the best way to protect my assets from inflation?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Most well-diversified portfolios are designed to protect the value of your assets over time, but some do a better job of that than others. As a general rule, companies with strong pricing power are the best situated to navigate an extended inflationary environment. Investments in tangible assets, like real estate and infrastructure, should also be expected to hold up well.</p>
<p>The strategies we manage here are designed with this in mind, and tend to hold larger-than-average concentrations of real estate and electric utilities. Our due diligence <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">process</a> also evaluates a company's degree of pricing power, which is a fancy way of saying that we take inflation extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Anyone concerned with inflation should also consider owning some I Bonds. Issued by the US Treasury, these are special savings bonds that automatically adjust their interest rates to account for inflation. That means that whether inflation rises or falls, you can rest assured that your I bond holdings will retain their purchasing power.</p>
<p>The primary drawback with I Bonds is that you can only purchase $15,000 worth of them in each calendar year. They also withhold a few months of interest if you sell the bonds within five years of purchase, but the yields are so much better than most other savings products that they are still a compelling option for many use cases.
