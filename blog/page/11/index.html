<h2 id="who-owns-the-assets-under-management"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/02/20/who-owns-the-assets-under-management/">Who Owns the Assets Under Management?</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this post for CFA Institute with my friend and colleague</em> <a href="https://www.thomasbrigandi.com/"><em>Thomas Brigandi</em></a><em>. It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Say whatever you want about the world, but there’s never been a better time to be an end investor.</p>
<p>Many things investment professionals fear — fee compression, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain — benefit clients through higher account balances and lower fees.</p>
<p>Asset owners are the largest of those clients. Though they are frequently lumped together as “institutional investors,” they can be as different from each other as any two individuals. The only characteristic they reliably share is size, which means their goals shape the market.</p>
<p>But what exactly are those goals? What do these organizations want?</p>
<p>Thomas Brigandi and his team of more than 400 volunteers began organizing the <a href="https://www.cfany.org/cfany-asset-owner-series/">Asset Owner Series</a> at CFA Society New York in 2015 with these questions at heart. Since then, they have hosted discussions among senior investors representing over $38 trillion in assets under management (AUM) or advisory (AUA). These candid, off-the-record conversations are open only to investment professionals. They will be increasingly available to CFA Institute members <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/07/11/1042700/0/en/CFA-Society-NY-The-Hong-Kong-Society-of-Financial-Analysts-Work-Jointly-to-Expand-Asset-Owner-Series-Globally.html">globally</a> at little to no cost, but only in person.</p>
<p>Institutional investors are characterized as “big fish” and “smart money,” but what else are they? Though Asset Owner Series commentary is not for attribution, the perspectives offered in these forums have removed some of the mystery surrounding these institutions, particularly the seven major types of asset owners and the motivations that are driving them.</p>
<p>Here are these “big fish” in roughly descending order of their AUM:</p>
<p><strong>1. Pensions</strong></p>
<p>Pension funds are the largest asset owners, with $36.4 trillion in AUM in 2016, according to Willis Towers Watson’s “<a href="https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/insights/2017/01/global-pensions-asset-study-2017">2017 Global Pension Asset Study</a>.” They fall into four primary categories:
  - "ESG Research"
  - "Sustainable Business"
- "ESG Research"
- <strong>Corporate pensions</strong> are sponsored by a single employer or several related employers within a corporate group. Many are “defined-contribution” (DC) plans, which means the plan sponsor does not bear the investment risk. The largest corporate pension plans include those of IBM, AT&amp;T, and United Technologies. Edmund A. Mennis, CFA, and Chester D. Clark’s <em><a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rf.v1983.n2.4716">Understanding Corporate Pension Plans</a></em> offers a thorough overview.
- <strong>Public pensions</strong> traditionally provide public employees in the United States and Canada with defined benefits after they retire. These benefits are based on a formula, not the investment returns of the beneficiary’s contributions. Mark Harrison, CFA, provided a helpful <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/05/17/lessons-from-the-canadian-public-pension-fund-model/">primer on the closely watched and widely emulated Canadian public pension fund model.</a>
- <strong>Union pensions</strong>, called Taft-Hartley plans in the United States, are operated by groups of companies together with officials of the unions that represent their workers. They are common in the building trades, trucking, retail, and mining industries. Some of the largest and most influential are the 1199SEIU Pension and Retirement Funds, Broadway League, National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT), and National Electrical Benefit Fund.</p>
<p>Pensions tend to be conservative and often rely on <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/11/21/beyond-modern-portfolio-theory-liability-driven-investment-strategies/">liability-driven investment strategies</a> to ensure that funds will be available to pay benefits when they are due. <a href="https://vimeo.com/97883297">Some have raised concerns that these funds will not be able to fulfill their responsibilities.</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Insurance Company General Accounts</strong></p>
<p>Insurance companies tend to invest the premiums they are paid in order to boost their earnings. Globally, insurance company assets totaled about $23 trillion in 2015, according to the most recent insurance indicators <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=INSIND">asset data</a> from the OECD.</p>
<p>The liabilities assumed by insurers can vary considerably in their predictability and timeframe, which leads to significant divergence in how the portfolios created to offset them are managed. Differences in regulation, product mix, and competition will play a role in the ultimate composition of these portfolios, but we can lay out some high level differences.</p>
<p>The three primary types of general accounts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: Providing health insurance creates a predictable but short-term liability with high liquidity needs. Managers of these accounts will thus keep as much as 25% of their portfolio in cash to meet these demands, and will tend to have some equity exposure to allow for long-term growth. Aetna Capital Management and CIGNA Investment Management are some of the largest organizations of this kind.</li>
<li><strong>Life</strong>: These long-term liabilities are often offset through long-term fixed income instruments, like Treasuries and corporate bonds. Managers tend to be prohibited from holding large equity allocations, so will diversify into mortgages and other assets while holding proportionally small cash balances. New York Life Insurance and MetLife are examples of large life insurance general accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Property and casualty</strong>: These insurers face “lumpy” liability streams that they offset by keeping as much as 10% of their assets in cash and 70% in bonds. They will typically blend equities and other assets in the balance of the portfolio to provide for some long-term growth. Among the large property and casualty insurance general accounts are Chubb and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Warren Buffett is perhaps the most widely known investor on the planet and <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/09/11/chasing-warren-buffett-alpha/">has built his impressive track record</a> in part by shrewdly managing the portfolios of insurance companies. John L. Maginn, CFA, <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/cp.v1994.n8.3">explored how these entities operated in the mid-1990s</a> in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong></p>
<p>Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are state-owned investment funds whose investable asset base is derived from a country’s reserves and has been set aside for intergenerational savings, reserve management, fiscal stabilization, retirement benefits, or development. Taken together, they <a href="https://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund-rankings/">manage just over $7.5 trillion in assets</a>.</p>
<p>Most SWF funding comes from budget and trade surpluses or revenue generated from the exports of natural resources. They are generally not liability-driven investors, and as such, can adopt a long time horizon in their investment activities. Some funds have pursued innovative strategies to exploit the <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cfm.v27.n1.10">“huge advantage”</a> their unique nature affords them, while others have <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/dig.v43.n4.30">fallen prey to political pressures</a> and underperformed.</p>
<p>The roughly $900-billion <a href="http://www.china-inv.cn/wps/portal/!ut/p/a0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOL9DMwMDJ2DDbwMfB3dDBwtDFx9_Y29PL3dTPQLsh0VAbe5RsU!/pw/Z7_N0601CS0J0MAF0A80EMO3JIC03/ren/p=WCM_PI=1/p=ns_Z7_N0601CS0J0MAF0A80EMO3JIC03_WCM_Page.37c7bb2f-53b1-4742-b47e-38d857981f67=2/p=CTX=QCPchina-invQCAportalQCPhome_enQCPMEDIA_enQCPPress_Releases_en/=/">China Investment Corporation</a> is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds, and also provides an interesting case study on the mechanics of operating such a fund. The fund’s chief representative, Felix P. Chee, discussed <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cp.v28.n4.1">how the fund approaches portfolio construction and risk management</a> in 2011.</p>
<p>A more detailed case study can be found in <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/op.v2018.n1.1"><em>Multi Asset Strategies: The Future of Investment Management</em>,</a> edited by my colleague. Larry Cao, CFA. The sixth chapter details the evolution of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. The closely watched fund does not reveal its AUM, but the US State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/investmentclimatestatements/index.htm#wrapper">estimated</a> they were in excess of $300 billion in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>4. Investment Consultant Outsourced CIOs</strong></p>
<p>The majority of large investment consultants have outsourced CIO practices. <a href="http://www.pionline.com/article/20170626/ONLINE/170629919/complex-portfolios-spur-increased-use-of-outsourced-cios"><em>Pensions &amp; Investments</em>‘ database</a> shows total OCIO assets reached $1.69 trillion as of 31 March 2017.</p>
<p>An OCIO will often manage all or a portion of the asset owner’s investment portfolio with discretion to make and monitor changes. The OCIO divisions of investment consultants differ from the core investment consulting business, which is to provide asset allocation and asset manager selection advice to asset owners. Collectively, investment consultants advise on trillions of dollars in asset owner assets under a nondiscretionary, advisory-only framework. Mercer, Russell Investments, and Aon Hewitt Investment Consultants are among the largest of these organizations.</p>
<p>Hiring one of these firms can “present significant advantages for a small fund,” as they bring significant expertise in investment management and manager selection, according to Jeffrey V. Bailey, CFA, and Thomas M. Richards, CFA, in their <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rf.v2017.n3.1">primer for investment trustees.</a> Though they also warn that the model comes with drawbacks, most notably that “the natural checks and balances of standard solutions” are somewhat lacking.</p>
<p><strong>5. Single Family Offices</strong></p>
<p>A single family office (SFO) is a private company that manages investments and trusts for one family. The number of family offices in the United States has grown to more than 3,000 with total AUM between $1 trillion and $1.2 trillion, according to Capgemini’s <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf">“Global State of Family Offices Report</a>.” These organizations can cost more than $1 million a year to operate and thus are mostly used by the wealthiest of the wealthy.</p>
<p>The SFO’s sole function is to centralize the management of a family fortune. SFO staff manage investments, taxes, philanthropic activities, trusts, and legal matters. SFOs are privately owned by high-net-worth families, so not much information on them is available to the public. Prominent SFOs include Willett Advisors, which invests the personal and philanthropic assets of Michael Bloomberg; the Heinz Family Office; and SAFO (Shari Arison Family Office) Investment Company.</p>
<p><strong>6. Endowments and Foundations</strong></p>
<p>Endowments and foundations (E&amp;Fs) are large pools of money that benefit a specific charitable cause. Endowments tend to serve educational institutions while foundations write grants for a wide range of causes.</p>
<p>In the United States, 805 college and university endowments and affiliated foundations collectively had over $515 billion in endowment assets, according to the <a href="http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/EndowmentFiles/2016-NCSE-Press-Release.pdf">2016 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments</a>. A further $865 billion is held by foundations, according to the <a href="http://data.foundationcenter.org/#/foundations/all/nationwide/top:assets/list/2014">Foundation Center’s database</a>. E&amp;Fs pay out on average 4%–5% of AUM each year to their specific cause.</p>
<p>No asset owner has a longer time horizon or is able to assume greater risk. E&amp;Fs have a perpetual life and no defined liability stream, which led to the evolution of the alternatives-heavy “Endowment Model” popularized by Yale University’s David Swensen. David Chambers and Elroy Dimson explored the origins and evolution of this model in a <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v71.n2.7">recent article for the CFA Institute <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>®</a>. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is the world’s largest foundation, while Harvard University has the largest endowment.</p>
<p><strong>7. Multi-Family Offices</strong></p>
<p>There are an estimated 150 multi-family offices (MFOs) in the United States with about $400 to $450 billion in AUM, according to Capgemini’s <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf" title="Link: https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf">“Global State of Family Offices Report</a>.” They provide a range of services similar to an SFO, but work with more than one family group. These services are available to wealthy clients with as “little” as $20 million in investable assets.</p>
<p>A MFO typically offers comprehensive investment solutions to affluent individuals and families, with some also handling other financial matters, including budgeting, insurance, wealth transfer, and tax services. Some notable MFOs are Bessemer Trust and Rockefeller &amp; Co.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>
<p>Many aspects of the investment landscape are set to change, but these asset owners are likely to remain at the center of the market for many years to come. So if you still have questions, Owen Concannon, CFA’s <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/ind.v2015.n1.1">exploration of the asset management industry</a> may be the next place to look.</p>
<p>There’s no substitute for primary sources, though, so we hope you’ll <a href="https://www.cfany.org/cfany-asset-owner-series/">come meet us in person</a> at your local CFA Society to find out why.</p>

<p>The Hon. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/joshua-gotbaum/" title="Link: https://www.brookings.edu/experts/joshua-gotbaum/">Joshua Gotbaum</a> is a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution in Economic Studies and a former director of the <a href="https://www.pbgc.gov/">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</a>. That's the government-run insurer which covers private pension plans in the United States, effectively backstopping about 40 million retirees. </p>
<p>It's not unusual to see dire projections associated with the PBGC. This chart is from their most recent <a href="https://www.pbgc.gov/about/projections-report">projections report</a>, and shows the probability that its multi-employer program will go insolvent. Things don't look good in 15 years or so. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/2016mep-insolvencyrisks.jpg"/></p>
<p>That scary tidbit is a common headline, but there's much more to the story. Josh and I spoke last week before his keynote address at the CFA Society of New York's <a href="https://www.cfany.org/event/unfunded-entitlement-liabilities-and-national-debt-symposium/">US Retirement and Entitlement Crisis conference</a>, and managed to cover a lot of nuance in just a few minutes.  </p>

<p><em>I wrote this for CFA Institute with the peripatetic and wonderful</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameersomal/" title="Link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameersomal/"><em>Sameer Somal, CFA</em></a><em>. It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>To many investors, India seems incredible but not necessarily investable.</p>
<p>Indeed, the challenges of <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/03/10/weekend-reads-adapting-to-india/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/03/10/weekend-reads-adapting-to-india/">adapting to India</a> as an investor go beyond not knowing what you don’t know: You won’t even be able to say most of it. Hindi and English are the most widely used languages, but the country has 22 official languages and many more are spoken, taught in schools, and printed in newspapers.</p>
<p>So there is little chance you’ll be mistaken for a local, but neither would either of us.</p>
<p>Sloane Ortel first visited India in 2009 and returned earlier this year for a three-month stint working out of the CFA Institute office in Mumbai. Sameer S. Somal, CFA, spends about a third of the year there. Though he is “Indian-American,” in India they just call him “American.”</p>
<p>Here are seven reasons why we’re planning to keep going back.</p>
<p><strong>1. Real returns are available.</strong></p>
<p>Investors once assumed their rupees would depreciate at a nearly constant rate. Why? Because of experience: From 2006 to 2013, inflation averaged over 9%, according to the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16166.pdf" title="Link: https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16166.pdf">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a>.</p>
<p>A lot has changed. In the summer of 2017, the <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi">Indian CPI</a> was rising more slowly than <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi">the United Kingdom’s</a>.</p>
<p>So investors might benefit by resetting their return expectations to the Indian context. <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/insights/portfolio-design/capital-market-assumptions">A recent set of capital market assumptions</a> from BlackRock forecasts nominal returns below 4% for every fixed-income asset class.</p>
<p>Indian citizens have a realistic prospect of earning 5% after inflation with a simple and widely available <a href="https://www.bankbazaar.com/fixed-deposit-rate.html">fixed deposit</a>.</p>
<p>And Indians remain criminally under-allocated in their domestic stock market, as this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/160ABFX1P-OkQXF7fprBLP9oatE5yHP1foYCP3LrlANQ/edit?zx=9ncjdxe0g5qv#gid=1542165677">spreadsheet demonstrates</a>. Just 0.17% of all wealth held by urban households is invested in equities, compared to 4.35% in fixed deposits. Land and gold are the most widely held assets, and though <a href="http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/interviews/hnis-shifting-investment-from-physical-assets-to-financial-assets-vidhu-shekhar-country-head-india-cfa-institute/story/259084.html">investors have shifted from physical to financial assets</a>, the rate of change has room to accelerate, especially if India’s becomes the world’s <a href="https://latest.13d.com/could-india-become-the-best-performing-stock-market-of-the-next-ten-years-d2b139bf1b69">best-performing stock market</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. A demographic dividend is due.</strong></p>
<p>India’s youth is one of its most promising economic features: Census data indicates that about 41% of its population is under 20.</p>
<p>By 2026, <a href="http://blog.euromonitor.com/2017/04/spotlight-india-consumers.html">India is projected to have</a> the world’s largest working-age population, and by 2030, 28% of the global workforce will live in India. India’s labor force <a href="https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/">will stay young</a> for many decades to come. That’s an epic opportunity to create the next generation of global leaders.</p>
<p>But every dividend is also a liability. India’s youth want work and meaningful careers. There just aren’t enough jobs. The <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Money/JYalqNRTOtaQCIU4EuXGRO/More-than-30-of-Indias-youth-not-in-employment-shows-OECD.html">OECD found more than 30% of the country’s young people</a> are out of work and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34671961">only about 5% of India’s labor force has any formal training</a>.</p>
<p>The government hopes to address this deficit through <a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=123296">the Skill India</a> and the <a href="http://www.makeinindia.com/about">Make in India initiatives</a>, among other projects. While there are not enough jobs in India, the demographics of many developed market economies are aging. The global appetite for Indian human capital in the form of skilled actuaries, programmers, researchers, doctors and engineers from India continues to expand.</p>
<p><strong>3. The middle class is booming.</strong></p>
<p>India’s “Urban Mass” cohort, composed of 129 million people earning over $3,200 on average, will drive the country’s growth, according to a <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/macroeconomic-insights-folder/rise-of-the-india-consumer/report.pdf">Goldman Sachs report</a>.</p>
<p>There is more room to expand: Median household income in China was <a href="http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/pressrelease/201702/t20170228_1467503.html">around the same level</a> in 2016. But an equivalent income in <a href="https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm">India buys quite a bit more than it does in China</a>. Rural wages have also <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-017-0052-9">grown rapidly over the last decade</a>.</p>
<p>Banks want access to this growing consumer population, and there are plenty of opportunities. Morgan Stanley estimates that India’s 9% mortgage-to-GDP ratio in 2016 <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/india-urban-real-estate-property-market">could rise to about 17% by 2026</a>. Broader capital access comes with side effects: India’s property sales are expected to compound at 14% a year from 2016 to 2020 and at 18% from 2020 to 2025.</p>
<p>This growth is not easy to leverage without significant adaptation, as <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/03/10/weekend-reads-adapting-to-india/">Ortel observed earlier this year</a>:</p>
<p>“A who’s who of firms have tried and failed to expand here: <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/pf/high-costs-and-losses-force-fidelity-to-exit-112032800066_1.html">Fidelity</a>, <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Industry/rjGIAVZg1wFVBPKuVrlDzJ/Wall-Street-is-giving-up-on-India-mutual-funds-as-JPMorgan-j.html">JPMorgan</a>, <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/goldman-sachs-mf-to-exit-india-sells-biz-to-reliance-mf-for-rs-243-cr/">Goldman Sachs</a>, and <a href="http://www.morningstar.in/posts/36650/nomura-exits.aspx">Nomura</a>. <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/multinational-foreign-banks-exiting-india-to-protect-profitability/articleshow/51520645.cms">The list of exits grows</a>. The better part of wisdom as a new entrant to the market is not to discount these efforts.”</p>
<p>But those who surmount the challenges of doing business here will earn the rewards. If India’s aggregate consumer spending reaches $13 trillion by 2030 as forecast, the country will be the world’s largest consumer market. The <a href="http://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/12579/why-this-4000-renault-is-as-disruptive-as-the-tesla-model-3?xid=twittershare">recent launch of Renault’s $4,000 Kwid</a> is a case study in how global firms can adapt their products to local tastes.</p>
<p><strong>4. A digital revolution is brewing.</strong></p>
<p>India is now the world’s second largest internet market, with a smartphone user base of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/26/technology/india-mobile-congress-market-numbers/index.html">over 300 million people</a>. The digital revolution is expected to double the country’s internet users by 2021, when an estimated 829 million Indians — or <a href="https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/internet-users-in-india-to-double-by-2021-cisco-vni/59066697">59% of the total population</a> — will be online, up from 373 million, or 28% of the population, in 2016.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/buzztop/buzztop-technology/the-panchayat-connection-technology-industry-bharatnet-project/story/245742.html">massive national fiber-optic network</a> is being built to power this growth. Much of that network will be constructed in villages and public spaces, with <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/30/technology/india-free-wifi-villages/index.html?sr=twCNN013017india-free-wifi-villages0912AMStoryLink&amp;linkId=33912413">free WiFi coming to 1,050 villages</a> as well as many railway stations. This will continue to cross-pollinate other verticals, including eCommerce. <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/">Flipkart</a>, India’s domestic competition for Amazon, already employs 30,000 people.</p>
<p>There are already more broadband users in India than there are people in the United States. <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/india-facebook-users-surpass-u-s-is-it-apple-demonetization-1499982716">India also has more Facebook users than any other country, having surpassed the United States this year</a>. Mobile video IP traffic will accelerate from 57% of usage in 2016 to 76% in 2021, when India will be consuming 84 billion internet video minutes per month.</p>
<p>The digital revolution will improve the delivery of government services. There is a thoughtful argument that <a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/01/24/2182612/vertical-integration-in-indias-crime-politics-nexus/?mhq5j=e2">criminal and political systems are vertically integrated</a> in India, and so leveraging technology to eliminate intermediaries is about more than just efficiency. The <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Companies/f7FBKuPT6EZsF8DrSyBYaK/Will-Indias-jump-in-ease-of-doing-business-rankings-foster.html">ease of doing business index</a> is already jumping as a result.</p>
<p><strong>5. The India Stack is growing.</strong></p>
<p>The India Stack is <a href="https://www.worldfinance.com/banking/inside-indias-data-fortress">as exciting as it is terrifying</a>. What is it? A national biometric identity database with 1.2 billion entries that link to medical records, bank accounts, government services, and more. It is an <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2017/02/20/why-is-india-letting-app-developers-use-its-biometric-database-the-short-answer/">open invitation for app developers</a> to build on a subcontinental scale.</p>
<p>It begins with Aadhaar, which means “foundation” in English. This is the national biometric database that <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blink/cover/the-aadhaar-of-all-things/article9609603.ece">started in 2008</a> and now covers around 82% of Indians.</p>
<p>The system is far from perfect: The <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lord-hanuman-gets-aadhaar-card/article6401288.ece">Hindu god Hanuman received an Aadhaar card in 2014</a>, so there are concerns about data quality as well as <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/02/14/india-aadhaar-uidai-privacy-security-debate/#skBP1qBZCOq4">security and privacy issues</a>. There have <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/aadhaar-data-leak-exposes-cyber-security-flaws/article9677360.ece">already been significant leaks</a>, and Jayanth Varma compares its transaction authorization to “<a href="https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2017/07/19/why-aadhaar-transaction-authentication-is-like-signing-a-blank-paper/">signing a blank piece of paper</a>.”</p>
<p>But there’s a reason Wharton’s fintech group calls it “<a href="https://medium.com/wharton-fintech/the-bedrock-of-a-digital-india-3e96240b3718">the bedrock of a digital India</a>.”</p>
<p>A significant plank of the India Stack, <a href="https://medium.com/wharton-fintech/your-guide-to-upi-the-worlds-most-advanced-payments-system-b4e0b372bf0b">the Unified Payments Interface</a>, will allow Indians to move money freely without negotiating various “walled garden” e-wallet networks. <a href="https://www.vccircle.com/mobile-wallets-losing-momentum-upi-soars-as-note-ban-impact-wanes/">More</a> and <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/upi-use-rises-100x-since-launch/articleshow/59046073.cms">more</a> people are opting in.</p>
<p>In a country with hundreds of spoken languages and widely varying educational levels, something along the lines of India Stack is the only way for digital payments to take hold.</p>
<p><strong>6. India’s fintech opportunity is here.</strong></p>
<p>Fintech partnerships in India are an area of extraordinary potential.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.startupbootcamp.org/blog/2017/07/fintech-india-trends-report-2017/">PwC and Startupbootcamp</a>, 95% of incumbent financial services firms in India are interested in fintech partnerships.</p>
<p>Payments stand out as a hotbed of activity and innovation. The Unified Payments Interface is a case in point: Its monthly transactions rose to almost 77 million in October. It’s not a coincidence that PayTm, a payments company, <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Companies/xEADXPNausn2DqUqcs1a6K/Paytm-raises-14-billion-from-SoftBank.html">recently attracted</a> the largest funding round by a single investor in an Indian start-up.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer lending (P2P) is also a hot area. The Reserve Bank of India has just announced <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11137&amp;Mode=0">regulations</a> for the sector to help move it out of the shadows and into the mainstream. But the next wave of financial services innovation is coming from unexpected places. Apps that provide telematics are helping to understand driving behavior and underwrite risk in motor insurance, and e-commerce marketplaces like Flipkart are <a href="https://www.vccircle.com/flipkart-will-soon-offer-customers-financial-products-and-services/">launching financial services offerings</a>.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. According to a report by Tracxn, there were 750 registered fintech companies in India in 2015, of which 174 launched that year alone. The opportunities for growth are vast: Even after demonetization, <a href="https://qz.com/1020384/cash-may-have-returned-in-the-economy-but-digital-transaction-have-surged-too-mastercard-india/">95% of financial transactions in India involve cash</a>. Fintech can provide India’s high-earning youth with investor education and direct access to the tools to help them make the most informed decisions. And as access to broadband and smartphones increases, these firms could offer inclusive financial services to the whole country.</p>
<p><strong>7. Institutions are strengthening.</strong></p>
<p>There are many forms of infrastructure. The traditional kind — bridges, roads, and ports — is still much needed in India. But the intellectual and relational infrastructure necessary for development is growing ever more robust. A few years ago, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/12/03/indias-importance-abroad-the-rise-of-the-indian-diaspora/">Ortel spoke with</a> author Anita Raghavan about the breadth of the Indian diaspora, which is <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/india-has-largest-diaspora-population-in-world-un-report/articleshow/50572565.cms">the world’s largest</a>.</p>
<p>Those are familial and geopolitical ties, but India is making remarkable strides on other fronts. Last year, U.K. Sinha, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, said that <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/business/india-s-minority-shareholders-have-stronger-rights-than-in-the-us-sebi/story-58Q4NTwwGNgBX6kTgNcraI.html">minority shareholders have better rights</a> in India than they do in the United States. While saying it doesn’t make it so, India’s soft infrastructure has made great strides.</p>
<p>A whopping 70% of the Indian population pays out of their own pocket for medical expenses. This typically strengthens the financial mechanism of the insurance sector. In the United States, the out-of-pocket expenditure is much lower, around 10% to 12%.</p>
<p>Hard infrastructure has made advances as well. <a href="http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/finance_budget/Budget_2015-16/White_Paper-_English.pdf" title="Link: http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/finance_budget/Budget_2015-16/White_Paper-_English.pdf">India’s rail network moves 23 million people every day</a>, and will soon feature <a href="https://qz.com/1030696/india-is-rolling-out-trains-with-solar-powered-coaches-thatll-save-thousands-of-litres-of-diesel/">solar-powered coaches</a>. This is progress, but <a href="https://outlook.gihub.org/countries/India">more rails and roads will be needed</a> to close India’s <a href="https://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=17435" title="Link: https://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=17435">output gap</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Growth comes next.</strong></p>
<p>The domestic investment industry is a hub for business process outsourcing, but banks are shipping highly skilled work to India to support a variety of global businesses. For example, Goldman Sachs spent $30 million to establish a center in Bangalore back in 2004. Now <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c1481ea-185d-11e7-9c35-0dd2cb31823a">it is building</a> a $200-million campus there with enough space to accommodate 9,000 people, more than a quarter of its 34,000 global staff.</p>
<p>But India is still a tiny position in the global market portfolio. At 8.64% of the <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/c0db0a48-01f2-4ba9-ad01-226fd5678111">MSCI emerging markets index</a>, India is weighted less than Taiwan (11.42%) and South Korea (15.63%). Increased attention <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/indias-weight-in-msci-em-index-to-rise-in-coming-years-morgan/article9821054.ece">should change that</a>.</p>
<p>All we can say for sure is that we’ll keep going back. The next decade of growth in India will bring millions out of poverty, into the formal economy, and toward better lives. It will be remarkable to watch and rewarding to participate in.</p>
<p>Perhaps we’ll see you over there?</p>

<h2 id="how-to-see-the-hidden-risks-of-etfs"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/01/18/how-to-see-the-hidden-risks-of-etfs/">How to See the Hidden Risks of ETFs</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this with my CFA Institute colleagues Paul Kovarsky, CFA, and Antonella Puca, CFA, CIPM, CPA. It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted <a href="https://etfstore.com/bloombergs-eric-balchunas-recaps-year-in-etfs/">more flows than “any structure ever”</a> in 2017, according to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas.</p>
<p>Is that bad? Steven Bregman, CFA, of Horizon Kinetics says the herd behavior ETFs inspire will be the “<a href="http://www.grantspub.com/files/presentations/Grant%27s%20Conference_Oct%204%202016_Steven%20Bregman_Final%5B2%5D.pdf">Delivery Agent of the Great Bubble</a>.” Mohamed El-Erian believes that the instruments “<a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/el-erian-warns-of-etf-contagion-risks-20170928">over-promote</a>” the liquidity of their underlying securities, which is in line with <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/literature/whitepaper/viewpoint-bond-etfs-benefits-challenges-opportunities-july-2015.pdf">findings from BlackRock in 2015</a> that fixed-income ETFs trade much more often than the bonds that comprise them.</p>
<p>Such sins, both real and imagined, mean ETFs are now described as “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-27/etfs-are-weapons-of-mass-destruction-fpa-capital-managers-say" title="Link: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-27/etfs-are-weapons-of-mass-destruction-fpa-capital-managers-say">weapons of mass destruction</a>” with disconcerting regularity. Mark Weidman, the global head of iShares, has said “<a href="https://www.bnn.ca/etfs/video/etf-apocalypse-concerns-way-overdone-blackrock~1112940">ETF apocalypse concerns are way overdone</a>” at least once. And yet <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-etf-risk-global-financial-crisis-2017-10">the murmurs continue</a>.</p>
<p>There is no doubt <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/04/12/keep-etfs-weird/">ETFs are weird</a>, but managing the risks they pose on behalf of clients doesn’t require a high-definition vision of the future. It just takes a simple question:</p>
<p><strong>What can’t the client see?</strong></p>
<p>ETFs are a great way to fulfill client objectives, but they also create a handful of opportunities to miss the mark. So advisers need to be vigilant.</p>
<p>A primary risk is that the fund will fail to appropriately track its benchmark. This can happen because of market conditions, despite the best intentions of the fund sponsors. So rather than adopting a “set it and forget it” mindset, advisers need to be diligent and monitor the ETFs in which they invest.</p>
<p>A straightforward example of this comes from the world of high-yield ETFs. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-08-18/an-extra-fee-may-be-hiding-in-that-junk-bond-etf-cost">Lisa Abramowicz noted this summer</a> that the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, trading under the ticker JNK, underperformed its benchmark by an average of 1.69% for the three years preceding her 18 August 2017 column. Rival fund BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG)’s three-year average underperformance of 0.79% seems like alpha by comparison.</p>
<p>It’s understandable that there would be a difference between the performance of an index and the vehicles designed to track it. Even when their objective is just to replicate an index, investment vehicles come with costs that are not always explicit. <a href="http://media.morningstar.com/uk/MEDIA/Research_Paper/Morningstar_Report_Measuring_Tracking_Efficiency_in_ETFs_February_2013.pdf">A 2013 exploration</a> of these issues from Morningstar found that funds generally did a good job limiting tracking error, but also pointed to interesting issues. The weekly error for ETFs tracking the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, for instance, ranged from 0.04% to 1.5%.</p>
<p><strong>A Defining Challenge</strong></p>
<p>If the performance of ETFs that track specific indices can be that variable, what about the funds with more idiosyncratic objectives?</p>
<p>Take the iShares MSCI BRIC ETF (BKF) and the Guggenheim BRIC ETF (EEB) as cases in point. Both seek to provide diversified exposure to Brazil, Russia, India, and China, but how much of each? The iShares offering <a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239614/ishares-msci-bric-etf">had 61.5% invested in China and 7% in Russia</a> at the time of this writing, while Guggenheim’s fund had <a href="https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/etf/fund/eeb-guggenheim-bric-etf/holdings">20.2% in China, 13.9% in Hong Kong, and 18.1% in Russia</a>.</p>
<p>You would think targeting just four countries would make the innate challenge of <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/02/09/whats-the-difference-between-emerging-and-frontier-markets/">defining emerging markets</a> simpler, but that’s just not the case. Fund structures can only mask the intrinsic complexity of markets, not eliminate it.</p>
<p>A vignette about ExxonMobil that Bregman <a href="http://horizonkinetics.com/wp-content/uploads/Grants_On-The-ETF-Divide.pdf" title="Link: http://horizonkinetics.com/wp-content/uploads/Grants_On-The-ETF-Divide.pdf">offered to <em>Grant’s Interest Rate Observer</em></a> illustrates this well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Aside from being 25% of the iShares U.S. Energy ETF, 22% of the Vanguard Energy ETF, and so forth, Exxon is simultaneously a Dividend Growth stock and a Deep Value stock. It is in the USA Quality Factor ETF and in the Weak Dollar U.S. Equity ETF. Get this: It’s both a Momentum Tilt stock and a Low Volatility stock. It sounds like a vaudeville act.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be the case that 138 years after John D. Rockefeller et al. formed the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, the shares of its corporate successor are indeed a tidy fit for such a broad diversity of investment objectives. But if that’s true, it also means that the risk of confusing activity and progress in managing ETF portfolios is real.</p>
<p><strong>Ask the Right Questions</strong></p>
<p>Determined curiosity is the primary asset you have to address these risks. <em><a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/rf/Pages/rf.v2015.n3.1.aspx" title="Link: https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/rf/Pages/rf.v2015.n3.1.aspx">A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</a></em> is likely to be helpful, but there is no substitute for your own analysis.</p>
<p>So ask questions. How liquid is this fund compared to the securities that compose it? Does it trade at a premium or a discount to its net asset value? Is there leverage built into the structure, and if so, is that leverage constant or variable? How closely does it track its benchmark?</p>
<p>But don’t forget the most important question: Does this asset fulfill a useful purpose in this portfolio? The recent wave of ETF offerings comes with a substantial risk of distraction: Diligencing structures are not necessarily indicative of progress towards fulfilling an investment objective.</p>
<p>It is critical to advance the state of practice in this area, and that’s why we will be joining industry leaders at the <a href="https://finance.knect365.com/insideetfs/">Inside ETFs Conference</a> next week to listen, learn, and teach. What’s clear already is that most practitioners have plenty to learn about the structures that will likely continue to grow in prominence for the rest of our careers.</p>
<p>As cutting edge becomes commonplace, we’re hopeful that discussion will turn away from apocalyptic predictions and towards the mechanics of diligence.</p>

<h2 id="4-charts-global-currency-crisis-count-and-implications-for-crypto"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/12/15/4-charts-global-currency-crisis-count-and-implications-for-crypto/">4 Charts: Global Currency Crisis Count and Implications for Crypto</a></h2>
<p>What's a currency crisis? The most straightforward definition I can find is this: if a currency's nominal exchange rate depreciates by 10% or more in one year and then 25% or more in the following year, it's a currency crisis. </p>
<p>This definition originated (as far as I can tell) from a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1996/534/ifdp534.pdfhttp://">1996 paper</a> by Jeffrey Frankel and Andrew Rose, and has also been used in <a href="http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/w17252/Online%20appendix%20C.pdfhttp://" title="Link: http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/w17252/Online%20appendix%20C.pdfhttp://">NBER materials</a>. The numbers appear to have been picked somewhat out of thin air, but it's a useful rule of thumb.</p>
<p>The recent run up in cryptocurrency prices has led me to wonder how many people have had their lives shaped by these sorts of events. If I'd lived through one, I think I'd be more likely to see the volatility, opacity, and other risks associated with crypto-assets as acceptable. They might even seem typical of currency in general.</p>
<p>The links above list a number of crises, but are only updated through 2007. I pulled <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neer.asp">Nominal Effective Exchange Rate</a> (NEER) data for 112 countries from the World Bank's <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/global-economic-monitorhttp://">Global Economic Monitor</a> to do a quick-and-dirty update. Only 85 countries had data available in 1988, but by 1995 all 112 were included. </p>
<p>Here's the number of countries in crisis each year. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/chart.png"/></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XFxfTsqu6QWUo4iydzySmRIpl5fi5SZltqMtaIM2gok/edit#gid=1439504162http://" title="Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XFxfTsqu6QWUo4iydzySmRIpl5fi5SZltqMtaIM2gok/edit#gid=1439504162http://">Here's the spreadsheet with the data</a>. </p>
<p>Using this sort of rule is imperfect, since depreciations need to align with the 12 month calendar in order to register. For instance, Indonesia's 69% depreciation in 1998 doesn't count because it happened fast. </p>
<p>But with that said, roughly 1.3 billion people live in countries that have experienced this sort of currency crisis in my lifetime, many of them more than once. Here's a table of all of the countries that have. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2017-12-15_at_8.42.07_AM.png"/></p>
<p>It would be difficult to establish a hard link between these events and openness to crypto-assets, because they have occurred much less frequently in recent years. That comes across in the first chart, but here is the YoY change in all of the currencies in the dataset. It's amazing how much things have calmed down. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/chart__5_.png"/></p>
<p>The contemporary picture is only placid compared to the chaos that surrounded the fall of the Berlin Wall, though. Since 2010, the percentage of countries in the sample that have experienced 10% or greater YoY depreciation has been rising steadily.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/chart__4_.png"/></p>
<p>There isn't a clear link between this currency volatility and demand for crypto, but I think it's helpful to understand the dispersion of human experiences with currency. Most of the world's capital is concentrated in countries that have been insulated from these sorts of wild price swings, and perhaps as a result investors forget how frequent they are. </p>
<p>Most of the bullish outlooks I've seen for crypto-assets are predicated on eventually capturing a material proportion of global market share. That seems moderately more plausible (though in no way preordained) after this exploration. And certainly it's easier to see why there might be innate global demand for a new kind of money.</p>
