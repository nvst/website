<p>It’s been 10 days since the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2015/press.html" title="Link: http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2015/press.html">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences</a> to <a href="http://scholar.princeton.edu/deaton" title="Link: http://scholar.princeton.edu/deaton">Angus Deaton</a> of Princeton University “for his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/angus-deaton-nobel-economics.html?_r=0" title="Link: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/angus-deaton-nobel-economics.html?_r=0">Press reports emphasized Deaton’s research into inequality</a> and its troubling growth in recent years. “I think inequality has gone past the point where it’s helping us all get rich, and it’s really becoming a serious threat,” Deaton said. Still, Deaton has expressed the hope that the primary legacy of his research will be his meticulous precision — his “carefulness in measurement,” as he put it.</p>
<p>Of course, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize is awarded for research in economics, not investing. That means that even though the contributions of Deaton and every other Nobelist are significant, there are material differences in how directly useful they are among the broad spectrum of investment professionals.</p>
<p>We’ve been fortunate to have a number of these distinguished figures attend CFA Institute conferences over the years, so we decided to ask <a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp" title="Link: https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a> readers to rank the contributions of these particular Nobelists.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Of the following Nobel Prize winners in economics who have spoken at CFA Institute conferences, whose work has had the biggest positive impact on the investment profession?</strong></p>

<hr/>
<p>A plurality (43%) of the 559 respondents pointed to the contributions of Eugene Fama as the most influential, while Robert Shiller and Daniel Kahneman’s scholarship each attracted 26% of the vote. The work of Thomas Sargent, Vernon Smith, and George Akerlof evidently wasn’t as valuable to our readers, since they each garnered 2% or less of the vote individually.</p>
<p>I went and looked at some of the speeches, interviews, and papers that these Nobel laureates have given at CFA Institute events and elsewhere, and I’ve selected some insightful ones to share with you. To increase the probability you’ll learn something new, I’ve listed them in the reverse of their ranking in the poll.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2011/sargent-facts.html">Thomas Sargent</a></strong></p>
<p>Sargent is credited with leading the (bloodless) rational expectations revolution. One of his big ideas is that the people whose actions are described by models can predict the future as well as the person who created the model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sargent discussed his work in a <a href="http://video.cfainstitute.org/services/player/bcpid3577743869001?bckey=AQ~~,AAABE5oc3_E~,Leu10fA0D1sc9Dh9wz3oyrstQJ-PkzpJ&amp;bctid=2593803962001">Take 15 interview with Ron Rimkus, CFA</a>.</li>
<li>Sargent examined <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v70.n2.6">the probability distribution function of potential future outcomes in terms of ambiguity aversion</a> at the 66th CFA Institute Annual Conference in Singapore in 2013.</li>
<li>Chetan G. Shah, CFA, reviewed Sargent’s book <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/br.v9.n1.14%40faj.2014.70.issue-6">Recursive Models of Dynamic Linear Economies</a> for the Financial Analysts Journal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2002/smith-facts.html">Vernon Smith</a></strong></p>
<p>Smith is most associated with economic experiments that put subjects in defined conditions and study their behavior. The owner of a <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2002/smith-photo.html">sweet ponytail</a>, he’s also a shoo-in for the title of “best hair” in this august company.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cynthia Harrington, CFA, interviewed Smith for <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cfm.v14.n5.2825">CFA Magazine</a>.</li>
<li>Peter Eickelberg, CFA, reviewed Smith’s paper “<a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/dig.v44.n11.12">Double Bubbles in Asset Markets with Multiple Generations</a>.“</li>
<li>Smith issued a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3179473/You-pretty-good-bubble-Sydney-Melbourne-Nobel-prize-winning-economist-Vernon-Smith-warns-property-buyers-AMP-Bank-cracks-investment-loans.html">warning about an Australian real estate bubble</a> in the Daily Mail.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2001/akerlof-facts.html">George Akerlof</a></strong></p>
<p>Initially gaining fame for the study of markets for lemons (cars that are broken), Akerlof has a made a number of wide-ranging contributions, spanning the fields of identity economics, bankruptcies, and the phenomenon of reproductive technology shock.</p>
<ul>
<li>James Surowiecki examined Akerlof’s research into <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/later">procrastination</a>.</li>
<li>Akerlof proposed <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/09/nobels.htm">a uniform tax on global carbon emissions</a>.</li>
<li>Cass Sunstein reviewed <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/oct/22/why-free-markets-make-fools-us/">Why Free Markets Make Fools of Us</a>, which Akerlof co-wrote with fellow Nobelist Robert Shiller.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2002/kahneman-facts.html">Daniel Kahneman</a></strong></p>
<p>The best quote I can find on Kahneman comes from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/16/daniel-kahneman-thinking-fast-and-slow-tributes" title="Link: http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/16/daniel-kahneman-thinking-fast-and-slow-tributes">Richard Layard</a>: “He made happiness respectable as a goal for society.” I won’t say anything more: That should induce you to at least watch the video interview.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kahneman discussed his work in a <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/08/09/take-15-daniel-kahneman-discusses-the-past-and-future-of-behavioral-finance-research-video/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/08/09/take-15-daniel-kahneman-discusses-the-past-and-future-of-behavioral-finance-research-video/">Take 15 interview with Ashvin B. Chhabra</a>.</li>

<li>Jason Voss, CFA, recounted a <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/02/06/nassim-taleb-and-daniel-kahneman-black-swan-shows-fragility-under-heavy-weight-of-anchoring/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/02/06/nassim-taleb-and-daniel-kahneman-black-swan-shows-fragility-under-heavy-weight-of-anchoring/">conversation between Kahneman and Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>.</li>

<p><em><strong>I extremely do not believe this anymore and retracted it in 2017.</strong> This site is meant as an archive, so I've included it here. More current stuff on financial journalism is available</em> <a href="http://srvo.org/tag/Financial%20Journalism"><em>here</em></a><em>. I've since written a lot about the attention economy, which this was an ineloquent stab at describing. This post was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/09/18/dear-apple-i-may-rob-your-store/">Apple and the news media are not on good terms right now</a>. The company’s newly released iOS 9 contains an ad-blocking feature that many journalists see as a potential death knell for the industry.</p>
<p>It’s rational to be worried. Journalists exist in a competitive sphere that is in many ways the worst of all worlds. The professionals in the field are constantly on the hook for creating content, and it’s not enough to just turn out one good story and then milk it for a long time. Content needs to be fresh every day, and reporting is a labor intensive endeavor, particularly when it comes to breaking news. So the amount of work that needs to be done just to stay relevant is daunting.</p>
<p>And almost nobody wants to pay for that work. The clearing price for information has dropped to “free,” which presents some business model challenges. It turns out one of the requirements for doing the work above is a live human being, and keeping one of them alive takes money.</p>
<p>Historically, that money has come from a mix of newsstand sales, subscriptions, and advertising. The first two have been gutted by the transition from print to digital, while the third has long been under threat. Is Apple’s move to include ad blocking by default a harbinger of things to come? Will it undermine one of the news media’s remaining financial foundations and spell the end of journalism? Are the ranks of the unemployed about to become drastically more literate?</p>
<p>**I’m Not Worried
**
If you take a step back from the discussion about revenue models and monetization to focus on the core function that journalism and journalists provide society, you arrive at a short but important list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transmitting information</li>
<li>Uncovering new information</li>
</ol>
<p>For some segments of journalistic activity, there is an excellent argument that this is a form of public service. Certainly it is critically important that the public is kept informed about what’s occurring in the halls of power and crises that could affect our daily lives. It’s obvious why many hear that journalism is under threat and connect that immediately to a significant risk to civil society.</p>
<p>But it’s not going to happen. Here’s why: A side effect of fulfilling the roles outlined above is that journalists gain a significant amount of influence over time. Influence is a tough thing to buy. You can purchase a spot on my Twitter feed or inside my Economist, but the odds that I am going to ignore you or even become annoyed are significant.</p>
<p>If you just publish something good, however, I (and others) will want to read it, and it will travel around the world without anyone spending a penny on it. And your influence will grow.</p>
<p><strong>So If You Want to Grow Your Influence, Buy a Journalism Organization</strong></p>
<p>Obviously that’s not a route available to everyone, but it doesn’t need to be. Plenty of people have money and want influence. A subset of those people might be able to offer a forever home to one of the beleaguered news organizations that fear its business model is abandoning it.</p>
<p>And I’m not suggesting everything is fine because, say, Jiffy Lube would be happy to sponsor The New York Times. There’s a clear pattern that develops as people grow wealthier: They start trying to leave a lasting impression. This has given rise to a number of great things that aren’t explained by pure commercial intent: the modern museum and the giving pledge, among them.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve essentially argued here that the journalism industry doesn’t need to worry about going extinct because there exists a coterie of friendly billionaires who would be more than happy to take it in as a pet. That does not feel good. And I’m not predicting that billionaires will cascade into newspapers and buy them out.</p>
<p>But I do think that they will have a market-defining effect well into the future. In other words, I think you’d be foolish to ignore the influence they can have in the valuation of any given media company. In M&amp;A speak, they are what’s called a “strategic” buyer, which means their idiosyncratic answer to the question “does this purchase make sense?” will have as much to do with the pricing of a property as the dollars and cents it creates.</p>
<p>And the net effect of that is that there will be money around to fund journalism for a long time, even if it doesn’t come from the newsstand, subscriptions, or advertising. The allure of enhanced influence will be enough to keep capital drifting into the news media for quite some time to come.</p>
<p><strong>And Some of That Capital Won’t Be Seeking Influence Alone</strong></p>
<p>Think like an entrepreneur for a second: What happens to the value of a new revenue model when an old one comes under threat?</p>
<p>Whether or not the new model is any good in real life, it will attract attention in roughly exponential proportion to any revenue it can create. For new ventures, attention has a way of transforming into influence. That influence might translate into just the sort of tailwind that a new venture needs.</p>
<p>Now is not an objectively fantastic time to go out and start a journalism business, but ventures that have been successful in monetizing without relying on ads are likely to be viewed as suddenly more valuable.</p>
<p>New ventures with novel approaches to monetization are also likely to continue beating down the doors of Sand Hill venture capitalists. Some of them will get funded. Few of them will work. But everyone will expect that going in.</p>
<p>And journalism will stay alive. And individual journalists who have been successful at informing and provoking reaction over the years will find their content still has value that someone (even if they’re not the ultimate consumer) is willing to pay for.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, these challenges would not be such a huge factor. But even in our imperfect world, there are people willing to fund projects for reasons that aren’t purely financial, as well as people who love to fund risky projects in uncertain times. Journalism will be fine.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-the-unterest-rate"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/09/21/introducing-the-unterest-rate/">Introducing the Unterest Rate</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>There was a lot riding on the US Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates the other day. Arguably everything, in fact.</p>
<p>Last time I talked about the US Federal Reserve, I suggested that the extreme level of uncertainty about long-term interest rates effectively breaks capitalism.</p>
<p>Surely we can agree that’s kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>But with this decision, there were two things hanging in the balance that are perhaps more important than the global capitalist system.</p>
<p>The first: a nerve wracking bet between yours truly and the excellent <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/author/paulmccaffrey/">Paul McCaffrey</a>, the complexity of which we hadn’t fully anticipated. Amid a context of sharply rallying bonds and equities, we couldn’t break a $10 bill to properly settle the wager. Chaos happens when trades don’t settle. All we can hope is that somebody walks by with two $5s to avert any potential systemic implications.</p>
<p>The second: the fate of the English language itself. It has always been hard to love markets if you also love words and clear expression. Some of the jargon dreamed up by investment professionals can seem like it was designed to troll any humanities major who might be hanging around. <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=worst+finance+jargon" title="Link: https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=worst+finance+jargon">This Google search</a> amply documents the breadth of the issue up until now. The number of alphabet soup abbreviations — <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031815/what-zero-interestrate-policy-zirp.asp" title="Link: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031815/what-zero-interestrate-policy-zirp.asp">ZIRP</a>, <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3015696-the-interest-rate-on-excess-reserves-is-the-new-fed-funds-rate">IOER</a>, and <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/tdf.htm">TDF</a>, for example — has long compounded at a rate far greater than most investors will ever experience.</p>
<p>But there’s a new piece of lingo on the horizon that crosses the line:</p>
<p><strong>Negative Interest Rates</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to stop saying this. Forever. And it’s not a small or merely rhetorical point.</p>
<p>Sure, “negative interest rates” doesn’t really roll off the tongue in the same way as theta burn, convexity, or some other acceptable piece of jargon. And it’s never a good idea to use three words when two will do. But that’s not why this turn of phrase is insidious.</p>
<p>It’s insidious because it has the potential to make you think wrong. Paying somebody to use your money for a while and being paid to lend your money for a while are fundamentally different transactions to engage in. And there are at least a few folks on the Fed’s board who believe it’s possible investors are going to wind up doing the former pretty soon.</p>
<p>Just look at the dot plot:</p>
<p>See those two dots in the updated version below 0.00? They mean that there are up to two voting members of the Fed who predict banks will be paying each other -0.25% for overnight borrowings at the end of 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p><strong>That’s an Unterest Rate, Not an Interest Rate</strong></p>
<p>And it’s not just a matter of style. I’m calling it something different so that we can collectively realize it will actually be something different.</p>
<p>To illustrate that, I’ll interview myself a little bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will an unterest rate environment persist for a long time?</strong> I don’t know. It’s never happened before.</li>
<li><strong>What happens to risk appetites in an unterest rate environment?</strong> I don’t know. It’s never happened before.</li>
<li><strong>How can retirees safely generate income in an unterest rate environment?</strong> I don’t know. It’s never happened before.</li>
</ul>
<p>So stay vigilant. We may be entering new and uncharted waters.</p>

<p><em>This was first published on CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Would it surprise you to hear that one of the world’s largest charities is a lot like Goldman Sachs? Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>If you think it’s because they both <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/goldman-sachs-profit-drops-but-beats-estimates/?_r=0" title="Link: http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/goldman-sachs-profit-drops-but-beats-estimates/?_r=0">don’t put much emphasis on fixed-income trading these days</a>, you probably need to take a vacation.</p>
<p>If you’re already thinking about the way that a financial toolkit could be applied to social problems, then I like you. That’s what I did. After puzzling over it for a little bit, I called Mark Tercek, president and CEO of the Nature Conservancy and author of <a href="http://www.marktercek.com/natures-fortune/">Nature’s Fortune: How Business and Society Thrive by Investing in Nature</a>, who was kind enough to answer my questions.</p>
<p><strong>Will Ortel: Mark, you followed a path that, I guess, is conventional. You went from a career in finance to a career in nonprofits. Was it as simple as: you made money, and now you’re a philanthropist? Or is there a knowledge transfer there that people might not expect?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Mark Tercek:</strong> Thanks for asking, Will. I worked at Goldman Sachs for 24 years. I had a really positive experience as an investment banker. It was great. As an investment banker, I was always one of those people who believed business and finance can be a force for good. I know not everybody agrees with that, and the financial crash is tough to reconcile for somebody who holds that point of view. But I was one of those true believers who believe that business could be a force for good.</p>
<p>Later, maybe midway through my investment banking career, I became very interested in environmental issues, climate change in particular. And so, I got quite interested in that intersection: “OK, if business could be a force for good,” I asked myself, “could business and finance also be a force for progress in the environment and in addressing climate change?” So, those became issues that were really important to me.</p>
<p>In 2005, I decided to leave Goldman Sachs — I was a partner — and go into the environmental field. Although, I admit I didn’t have a very fully developed plan. I talked to my boss at that time, Hank Paulson, about it. He didn’t think my plan was very good, and he had a different idea. “Mark,” he said, “you should stay at Goldman Sachs and build an environmental effort for the firm.”</p>
<p>So, Hank talked me into doing that and I did it. It really accelerated my learning on environmental matters broadly and how business and finance can make a positive difference. That was the last job I had at Goldman Sachs after a very mainstream career. And my last position was building this environmental effort. I was really enthused about it.</p>
<p>When the Nature Conservancy job opened up, the headhunter called me. The headhunter was really looking for other ideas I might have, but I used the opportunity to nominate myself. And lo and behold, I ultimately got the job. And so, that’s how I got here. I arrived as a former investment banker who cares about environmental issues and believes that business and finance skills can really be instrumental.</p>
<p><strong>When you talk about Goldman Sachs playing in an environmental market, that implies that there is a spectrum of involvement. Goldman Sachs obviously is for-profit, and your experience there is relevant to your work at the Nature Conservancy, which is a mission-driven nonprofit. What’s the difference between the sorts of projects that you get involved in at the Nature Conservancy and the sorts of projects that you got involved in at Goldman Sachs?</strong> </p>
<p>It’s really been interesting and fun for me. And I always encourage people that if they’re in the position to do so, pursue a second career in the social sector. When I transitioned from Goldman to the Nature Conservancy, which we call TNC for short, in some respect, it didn’t feel like such an abrupt transition because, just like Goldman Sachs, TNC is a global organization. We’re kind of organized, structured, and staffed like a professional service firm. We hire really bright entrepreneurial, problem-solving go-getters deployed all around the world. And at the Nature Conservancy, we do deals. We buy things. We act like a merchant banker. We represent governments and companies on transactions.</p>
<p>But here, nature is our client. That’s the bottom line. That’s the big difference. And so, I think it makes our work more challenging. In hindsight, business looks easy to me because you have such clear metrics and measures — cash flow, IRR, market share — these kinds of things. So, you can really know (with some confidence) how you’re doing and which strategies work better than others.</p>
<p>In our world here in the environmental problem-solving area, it’s a bit murkier than that. At the Nature Conservancy, our mission is to save the lands and waters that life depends on. So, that almost sounds grandiose, but that’s what we’re trying to do everyday. A lot of the work we’re doing has never been done before. So, we’ve got to be smarter about how we measure our progress. We’ve got to use science in a very sophisticated way to know whether we’re deploying our resources, capital, talent, et cetera in the best way.</p>
<p>But, in a very general sense, the Nature Conservancy is not that different from a well-run Wall Street firm trying to solve problems. It’s just that nature is our client. When we think about deals and when we think about raising cash flow for deals, it’s a lot like looking at a straight up financial deal. What kinds of cash flows can one structure? What’s the risk that goes with that? What are the right sources of capital to optimally finance an opportunity?</p>
<p>**Walk us through what that looks like in evaluating an opportunity. We were exchanging emails about Morro Bay. Could you go into that?
**</p>
<p>Yes. Morro Bay is a great example. So, until very recently, the Nature Conservancy financed most of its projects with donor capital or government grants. We get some government grants but not really that much. Mostly we rely on donor capital to do our projects, and that’s great. I mean it’s extraordinary how generous our supporters are. They’re generous, passionate people. The Nature Conservancy is a really big organization, and that’s due to the generosity of our supporters.</p>
<p>But if you think about that donor capital, you could liken it to investor equity. Financial analysts, Wall Street types, know that if you’re going to be efficient from a financial perspective, you want to use that precious equity very carefully and strategically. And when possible, you want to lever that up with other capital, lower cost capital.</p>
<p>Now, the Nature Conservancy, we’re a good credit. But we’ve got to be careful about borrowing to do projects because we’re nonprofit. We shouldn’t be levering up on our own balance sheet very frequently because we’ve got to be careful about how we’ll pay that capital back.</p>
<p>And so as a result, broadly speaking, most of our projects have been equity financed or donor financed. And one is the one you mentioned, Morro Bay. It’s a great story. I wrote about it in my book, <a href="http://www.marktercek.com/natures-fortune/">Nature’s Fortune</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, the Nature Conservancy and some other really good environmental organizations had ideas about how we could improve fishing practices in the Morro Bay, which is in Central California. People have been fishing there for generations. Until recently, the technique that had been used is bottom trawling, which means dragging kind of a rake — it’s a big rake — across the seabed to gather fish. And although that does gather fish, it ruins the seabed. It ruins the fishery and pulls up a lot of other sea life that the fishermen weren’t seeking. And so, of course, to the environmentalist, that is really suboptimal.</p>
<p>So, we went to the fishing community, and we argued and cajoled and tried to talk people into doing business on a different basis. As you might imagine, environmentalists and fishermen don’t speak the same language. So, we didn’t get very far. The other environmentalists we were working with kind of concluded this wasn’t going to work, and we were all about to give up. At the last minute, the Nature Conservancy had a really cool idea. This is before my time here. So, I’m not bragging about anything I did, but I found this to be an inspiring story.</p>
<p>Rather than give up, the Nature Conservancy bought some vessels and some fishing licenses, and we joined the fishing community — and that really freaked people out. They said, “Oh, my God. Now these environmentalists are here.” But we got to know one another. And we leased our vessels to fishermen who were willing to fish on what we thought were sustainable bases, and we showed the local community that it was possible. Then it was kind of complicated. But, for example, one of the outcomes was we used hook-and-line fishing techniques rather than bottom trawling. And hook-and-line brought the fish up alive and that made them eligible for the very lucrative high-value sushi market, and it turned out that was a more lucrative practice of fishing.</p>
<p>So, anyway, fast forward, we became friends with the other fishermen. We put in place regulations, regulatory processes to protect the fishery. People have gravitated now toward much better practices, and it’s really a great story. And you could call it a complete success, really a great success.</p>
<p>From a financial perspective, though, it would be hard for us to do that often because, again, we financed those purchases, those vessels and licenses, with donor capital, our equity. And that’s a very precious financial resource, and we never have enough of it.</p>
<p>So now, fast forward to today. Our know-how and our fishing sciences have improved a lot. So, we think we know how to similarly intervene at fisheries all around the world and change practices. But again a financial intervention is required. Maybe it wouldn’t look exactly the same. Maybe we wouldn’t buy vessels. But on one basis or another, we have to induce the fishing community to fish differently, to fish less, even sometimes stop fishing for a while. Our idea today is we can pay people to do that because these fishing communities sometimes have capital costs that they need to serve; sometimes they’re very poor people and fishing is their livelihood. So, they need an alternative livelihood and we need capital to address that.</p>
<p>But our reasoning is that we could have a capital structure that has some equity, but we could also borrow funds that would pay to change the fishing practices. We believe that the fishery could recover and then reopen, and we could get our fair share of the proceeds of the reopened fishery, and in that manner, pay off our borrowed funds, earn a return to the equity investors, and now we might have a sustainable and scalable source of finance for those kinds of interventions.</p>
<p>That’s a big deal because in the old model we can only do a little bit of it, and we don’t think the pace will be fast enough to address the world fishing challenges right now. But if we should do it on a financially sustainable basis that provides returns in the way I just outlined, then we could raise a lot of capital and do it at scale, and we’re trying very hard to do that now.</p>
<p>So, that’s an example of bringing modern financial practices to the philanthropic sector — in this case, fisheries conservation — and that’s very new stuff. And it might sound kind of boring and conventional to your sophisticated financial audience, but it’s very new in our space. And it’s daring, too, because we don’t have a track record here. We have this one deal financed with all equity. So, we’d be doing something new. It’s akin to opening a new financial market. We’re very excited about this.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like you’re talking about impact investing. Am I using the right word there?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, impact capital is the word there. Impact investing, you hear a lot about it right now. It’s kind of a loose term and people mean different things by it. What I think most people would agree with, though, is that impact capital is investor-provided capital to supplement donor capital to drive the social sector, and in our conversation now, let’s limit that to the environmental and conservation sector.</p>
<p>We’re very interested, just like I described in that fishery example, in raising capital to lever those donor funds up And so, we’re interested in doing conservation deals with predictable cash flows that will allow us to build smart capital structures. Now, in some cases, the cash flows are very predictable, so that would allow for a very levered capital structure and that could be prudent. In other cases, we have some very daring ideas, so that would call for a much less levered capital structure, but it still could draw on investor capital rather than donor capital.We think this is a way to get a whole bunch of new money and new people into the game.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll add for the Nature Conservancy, we’re especially interested in investor capital that will be provided to us at below-market terms. We’ll be able to do some deals at market, but we can do even more below market. And then you say, why would someone do that? Why would a financial investor provide you dollars at better than market terms? Here’s the answer. There are a lot of folks out there who are in a financial position and interested in supporting the Nature Conservancy’s good work, but they’re not ready yet to be donors. It takes a lot of work, more than you might think, to be a donor. Hands-on financial people have made a lot money. They want to be just as hands-on when it comes to giving their capital away, and they’re right now too busy in their careers making capital. So, they’re not ready to be donors.</p>
<p>I argue to folks like that, instead of giving us money, lend us money or invest in deals. Here are the cash flows. We’ve got a real track record here, so we can reliably put together cash flows. Some are riskier than others. So, we’ll structure the capital appropriately, and it’s a way for people to get in the game, help the Nature Conservancy achieve its important mission, and get to know us better. All those folks can feel good about making the world a better place, they’ll get their capital back and the return, and later down the road, when they’re ready, they can be donors, but it can really escalate our ability to make things happen now.</p>
<p><strong>I’m thinking about something you said earlier when describing the capital you have from donors: “We never have enough.” That sounds perfectly right. But I wonder how — if you were to try to figure out how much money you need — I don’t even know if it’s possible. I guess you could buy every forest on the planet, but short of that, is there something that looks like a market cap or something like that for conservation opportunities or is trying to put that level of precision on it just kind of stupid.</strong></p>
<p>Well, no, I don’t think it’s stupid because you want prospective investors to know that this is a big market. It’s likely to be a liquid market, and therefore, it’s worth your time now in the early start-up stages to get in the game and get engaged.</p>
<p>I remember in my Wall Street career, a lot of new markets started. For example, I was around — I’m old — when the high-yield market started, and when it began, people called it the junk bond market. It wasn’t called the high-yield market then. It was small. It wasn’t very liquid. It was a risky place. But everybody — the big institutions, the banks, the investor institutions, and the capital users — mostly concluded this is likely to go forward and work.</p>
<p>So, it’s worth our while to do the work now even though it’s a small market. But it’s going to be a big market someday. And so we want people to know that’s likely to be the case for conservation impact capital too. Smart people have put together estimates, such as $250 billion. So, this could be an enormous market.</p>
<p>I have to hasten to add, though, that estimate is very speculative because just take my fishery example. There are, in fact, very few examples of what I’ve described. There’s our [Morro Bay] deal, and there are a couple of other deals. They are very small and an enormous amount of care went into them, so it’s going to be up to people like us. You could think of us as almost like the banker or the middleman. It’s going to be up to the fishing communities and the investors.</p>
<p>I think it’s very reasonable to think that one success will lead to another, and I can point to a bunch of other areas in nature conservation where that’s the scale, but it’s the very early days. But I think it’s reasonable for institutions to think this could be very, very big.</p>
<p>As a result, for example, JPMorgan is an important partner of ours right now. We have this entity called <a href="http://www.naturevesttnc.org/">NatureVest</a>. JPMorgan has been a very generous philanthropic supporter. They made a generous grant to allow us to step up. That’s a hard thing for a nonprofit to do: Raise some money to hire some people to do a new thing.</p>
<p>JPMorgan allowed us to do that. So, we hired some young versions of people who look like me, men and women who have financial skills and are interested in the environment and like to put their financial know-how to work for nature. JPMorgan is also collaborating with us, lending us people, deal people, investor people, and coverage people. What are JPMorgan motives? Well, they want to be a good corporate citizen. They care about the environment. They’d like to help us.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of philanthropic concerns, but they also anticipate that there is every reason to think this impact capital market will be big, and so that would be their additional payoff. They’re one of the early movers here. So, that’s how I think smart people are thinking about this opportunity, but it’s the early days.</p>
<p><strong>Although it may be the early days in the private market that we’re talking about, our audience of professional investors is primarily concerned with the public markets. Are there opportunities to think green and gain an edge in public markets?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I’d say this: I think — I hope — investors are paying close attention to the companies they invest in and how they’re thinking about various environmentalists. It’s always a little hard to tell. I’m always encouraging CEOs, and I pitch this right to the CEO level because you really need the CEO’s engagement. Most companies, in my view, are crazy if they’re not paying very close attention to environmental challenges because over the next five years, it’s inevitable to me that their success is going to depend in large part on how they address those challenges. A lot of them agree, and they work with us to get better at those kinds of opportunities.</p>
<p>But others often say, when we talk to our analyst in quarterly earnings calls, that no one seems to care about our environmental initiatives, and it surprises me when I hear that. I hope your audience isn’t thinking that way because if you think of — for example, off the top of my head — any beverage company that’s not paying very close attention to its sources of water, it’s crazy, right?</p>
<p>Because the climate is changing, there’s enormous stress on water. There’s enormous demand on water. And companies, whether they are beverage companies or food companies, need to be well aware of those risks and have strategies to protect themselves. So for investors, my first point would be to pay attention to these environmental issues. Obviously, you can see they’re not going away. They’re only going to become more difficult, and most businesses are going to be right at the front edge of dealing with that.</p>
<p>I think the investors who are early players in these impact capital deals are going to gain an edge. It’s like any of these in new markets. The first one — they’re not cookie cutter. You can’t just buy. It’s not going to be just like buying a public offering with a rating and you don’t have to do a lot of work. The early deals are going to require work, but that’s going to allow people to do some good deals. It’s also going to make them very, very smart about some of the most important trends the world is going to have to address over the years ahead.</p>

<h2 id="hedge-fund-fees-are-the-rorschach-test-of-investing"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/08/18/hedge-fund-fees-are-the-rorschach-test-of-investing/">Hedge Fund Fees are the Rorschach Test of Investing</a></h2>
<p>If you want to get to know an investor in an abbreviated period of time, you really only need to ask them one question:</p>
<p>“What do you think of hedge funds?”</p>
<p>There are three possible answers, all involving management fees, but only one signals an enviable degree of insight.</p>
<p>The most common answer runs along the lines of “Those guys are crooks! How could they ever justify those massive fees?” This response suggests a lack of creativity — it’s the sort of answer you get from investors who feel like they have figured everything out. The best way to continue a conversation is usually to ask probing questions about the lens they see the world through. If they’ve constructed it thoughtfully, you might be able to pick up some great nuggets of wisdom.</p>
<p>A second, less common answer is the polar opposite: “I love ’em! The haters don’t know what they’re talking about. Hedge funds must be worth the fees, or how would they stay in business?” This answer implies a lack of basic intelligence. If you can say “uncorrelated,” “research intensive,” and “unique” enough times, you might be able to continue the conversation by pitching this sort of investor on the hedge fund you’ve recently decided to start.</p>
<p>The third answer is the sort you only get at places like the CFA Institute <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/tag/cfa-institute-financial-analysts-seminar/">Financial Analysts Seminar (FAS)</a>. It’s less quotable but much more nuanced.</p>
<p>“For some sorts of strategies, I see some value,” these respondents say. “But it’s really a function of how the fund fits in the context of a portfolio.” Even better responses note that “It really depends what the client wants to achieve.” This conversation should largely take care of itself. It turns out that folks who are passionate about giving clients their preferred outcome are easy and engaging to talk to.</p>
<p>So, what does this third sort of investor really think about hedge funds?</p>
<p><strong>Relationship Status: It’s Complicated</strong></p>
<p>The short answer is simple: Hedge funds are useful if their fees relate to value. The long answer is more complicated, because ascertaining the value that active managers provide has only gotten more difficult. A morning case discussion at FAS about <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/11/17/is-calpers-a-canary-in-the-coal-mine/">CALPERS’s decision to leave hedge funds</a>, which was led by the excellent <a href="http://www.darden.virginia.edu/faculty-research/directory/george-yiorgos-allayannis/">Yiorgos Allayanis</a> of the Darden School of Business, weighed a host of issues and featured vehement (yet polite) arguments both in favor of hedge funds and against them. The case was far from decided by the time the 90-minute forum came to a close.</p>
<p>We focused on a specific situation: Was it a good decision for CALPERS to move away from alternatives? We quickly honed in on the question of whether these managers had beaten their benchmarks. If you’ve thought about <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/04/02/investment-strategy-rethinking-hedge-fund-indices/">hedge fund benchmarking</a> at all, you know there are many different aspects to consider. And the question is important! Hedge funds can be thought of as organizations that spring up to produce alpha, which is only possible to calculate in relation to a benchmark.</p>
<p>It was fitting that the FAS ended with a presentation entitled “The Decline of Alpha,” delivered by <a href="https://magnitudecapital.com/team.html">Benjamin S. Appen, CFA</a>, of Magnitude Capital and a discussion moderated by <a href="http://www.focuscgroup.com/about/michael-falk-cfa/">Michael Falk, CFA</a>, of Focus Consulting Group. Appen acknowledged that it is possible to replicate the work of some hedge funds at a much lower cost via passive approaches to investing, but he stressed a belief that I tend to agree with: Passive investing is a sub-optimal strategy for expert investors. Not everybody is resourced to pursue investment opportunities, but it’s worth it when you have the capital, aptitude, and inclination.</p>
<p><strong>How Do You Do It?</strong></p>
<p>For starters, you’ll need a benchmark — the bulk of Appen’s presentation centered on a benchmarking strategy he and his colleagues have constructed and made available to the public at <a href="http://betterbenchmarking.com/" title="Link: http://betterbenchmarking.com/">betterbenchmarking.com</a>. They see it as a streamlined approach to the exercise.</p>
<p>The intellectual thrust of Appen’s thinking is simple: Investors should evaluate an investment manager by separating returns attributable to readily available market factors (beta) from the returns that come from manager skill (alpha). But implementation is tricky. How do you get started?</p>
<p>The method Appen laid out is somewhat “quick and dirty.” He takes the beta of a manager’s track record with respect to equity, credit, and bond market risk, and then he generates a passive benchmark using those same risk exposures. This should make it clear whether a manager is adding value relative to the risks they are taking. A more detailed analysis, in which additional factors are considered, should give a substantial amount of insight into the sources of a manager’s returns — and whether they are truly worth paying a hefty “two and twenty” for.</p>
<p>The exercise left me with two big takeaways. The first is that even though it’s important to specify a manager’s benchmark at the beginning of their mandate — and to evaluate them in the context of that benchmark — it probably is not enough. Especially when a manager has a broad mandate and lots of operational flexibility, it makes more sense to deconstruct their returns, breaking them down into specific contributing factors. If most of the returns are coming from a factor that can be accessed inexpensively, then there’s little reason to pay substantial management fees to an intermediary.</p>
<p>The second takeaway is perhaps less intuitive. If these methods of analysis are more widely applied, and the subset of managers that are not providing a value-added service go out of business, what happens to the managers who remain in the game? After all, there are strategies and firms producing returns not clearly attributable to an easily accessible factor. Will their fees decrease as allocators of capital bring more scrutiny to the world of hedge funds?</p>
<p>It seems that fees on hedge funds could just as likely go up as down. In a world where there are fewer manufacturers of hedge fund products and those who stay in business are very closely observed, managers might become more confident in asserting their value.</p>
