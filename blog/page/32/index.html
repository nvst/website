<h2 id="the-social-media"><a class="toclink" href="../../2009/03/16/the-social-media/">The Social Media</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this in my second semester at the College of Idaho. It was originally untitled, but my irony-free usage of "The Social Media" in it made the right title obvious in retrospect.</em> </p>
<p>Media pundits often speak breathlessly about the ongoing democratization of our world because of the increasing involvement of the “Joe the plumbers” of the world. The phenomenon through which they have come to be involved has been referred to as “grassroots” or “citizen” journalism: a process by which citizens are actively involved in the creation and editing of online news stories through the ability to comment, filter, and create/share substantially anything they want. </p>
<p>I have participated in this phenomenon through “social media” websites like Digg.com and Reddit.com, where I have long been voting on stories in an effort to collaborate with my fellow users to bring the stories most relevant to our microcosm of society to the front page. The intersection of opinions about what news is most relevant can lead to interesting problems.</p>
<p>When I first got started using the social media, it was through digg.com, which was at that time a relatively small community of likeminded users. I found the vast majority of the news stories to be relevant because its combination of important social news and irreverent internet jokes appealed to the eighteen year old, slightly pimplier version of me.</p>
<p>Digg.com started to become less appealing to me as its user base started to grow unwieldy. Since Digg’s user structure depends on users discussing and voting on issues for one front page. There is only one front page, so the interests of the community must be quite relevant to one another in order to give a relevant experience to the whole userbase. As the site continually grew, the friendly community of eighteen year old boys laughing at funny pictures of animals and learning about the Austrian school of economics swiftly became an online red light district. With each incremental user, Digg took a step down an inexorable path to become an Obama/Ron Paul/repetitive joke machine.  I started to grow dissatisfied as Digg grew into an online times square: a big place so actively purporting to be hip that one cannot help but be repulsed.</p>
<p>As my revulsion grew, I began looking for sites which had similar functionality but a method to control the overwhelming number of users on a site. After much searching, I found reddit.com, a site which allows the user to subscribe to various news feeds in specific subject areas. The website then concatenates those various news feeds into a single feed, which effectively displays a great deal of information that is relevant to my interests, while still being edited by a small group of relatively sane individuals.</p>
<p>This forum allows for both insightful and irreverent discussion of the articles, as well as an ability to comment on Reddit rather than the underlying site in order to discuss the story in a more back-and-forth way than by simply posting a reaction on the website and seeing what happens. The reddit/digg manner of interaction also allows for the posting of “anti-news”, as in the revelation of irresponsible coverage of news reporting or the non-coverage of an event.</p>
<p>The social media has helped me not just because it steers me towards “the best” article in any particular news cycle, but also because it has the capability to bring stories to our attention that would not normally find themselves headline news on network TV: stories like a group of anonymous internet users collaborating online to catch a pedophile, or the Pope’s continuing non-action in sending condoms to Africa. The sites mix funny news with real news and real chat in the comments, in a way that makes them palatable and fun to consume.</p>

<p><em>This is an incomplete "free write" from journalism class at the College of Idaho.</em> </p>
<p>In the beginning, the internet was very much a dynamic, wild-wild-west sort of place. Online newsgroups distributed hand in hand news stories, internet pornography, and other items of interest to the few people willing to spend time in text-based browsers viewing hard to access news.</p>
<p>At that very early time (1988-1994ish), there were few enough people online that hyperspcialization of news wasn’t as easy as it is today, but there were still various newsgroups that catered to specific interests. Newsgroups like Alt.Sports.Redsox, Alt.News.Business, and Alt.Art.Baroque.</p>
<p>With the rise of the “walled garden” internet community, like AOL or Compuserve, there were many more customers to serve, but the infrastructure of the web was such that each provider would provide exclusive services for their clientele alone, meaning that the focus was much more on providing a broad amount of internet coverage rather than hyperspecializing. It took a long time for the focus of the internet to go back to being the individual’s interest, First the ‘walls’ in the walled gardens broke down as consumers began to seek out news from places other than their internet provider’s sites, allowing for more specific-interest websites to arise on the web.</p>
<p>As this process went on, we started to see the rise of the customized: News sites that knew their readers and could recommend stories about pumpkin pie to grandmothers and people with humorous phallic catastrophes to pimply teenagers.</p>

<h2 id="post-falls"><a class="toclink" href="../../2008/12/03/post-falls/">Post Falls</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this at the end of my first semester at the College of Idaho.</em></p>
<p>I land at Spokane airport. I have been throwing up almost all day. My palms are sweaty; I’m carrying a half-eaten loaf of bread (the only thing I had been able to eat). It does not feel like I’ve just gotten out of college after six exhausting weeks. It feels like I’ve been the Guinea pig in a government experiment, followed by scientists furiously taking notes.</p>
<p>My friend Matt had kindly offered to let me stay at his house over mid-semester break. I had gladly accepted – excited to see what life was like in North Idaho and anxious to spend a precious week away from the friendly confines of the College of Idaho’s Caldwell campus.</p>
<p>Now, after an unfortunately timed illness and a long plane ride punctuated by a neighbor who would not shut up about how much money he had made buying houses with subprime mortgages, I found myself about to meet matt’s girlfriend and shortly after, his family. I was not feeling entirely sociable.</p>
<p>Shortly after we had driven across the Idaho state border to his house, I was sitting on my borrowed bed, ready to go to sleep. I looked out the window on the skyline of Post Falls, Idaho and couldn’t help but compare it to the view of New Jersey from my mom’s apartment in New York. Jersey Never twinkles the same way that Post falls does at night – the flat land and lack of other light make each and every light switch a tapping foot, working in concert to form a staccato rhythm resonating out into the night sky.</p>
<p>A day later, I found myself at the helm of an ancient ford f-350 superdeisel in matt’s front yard. I was listening to Country music because (as I had learned) country music is the only thing on most radios that is still intelligible over the drone of a chainsaw in close proximity. My job was to wait until the tree’s trunk is sufficiently weakened, so that I can use the truck’s four wheel drive to pull it over. It’s a simple job, but one I manage to fail at more often than not. I learned slowly that trucks don’t like to be driven with the emergency brake on.</p>
<p>After we managed to fell the tree, I grabbed my smaller chainsaw out of the back and began to cut branches off. Wielding a chainsaw gives trees a whole new and much more impermanent presence. Matt and I relieve the tree of its branches in five short minutes before cutting up the tree’s trunk and moving on to clear out young saplings from the rear quarters of his ranch.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to make sure the trees are evenly spaced” he says as he indicates five, six, seven trees that I should cut down “this way we can protect against this whole forest going up in flames.” At first, it’s a tough sell to me that killing trees is actually beneficial to trees, but it begins to make sense once I imagine myself in the middle of a burning forest. The floor of the forest is thickly coated with dried pine needles, and would swiftly ignite with any provocation, since there is not much rain up here and the needles are almost an inch thick on the ground. It’s not hard to imagine this quickly becoming a carpet of fire.</p>
<p>As I cull the herd of its weaker members, the imagined fire is much less damaging, especially since we are also lopping off the lower branches of the trees. Likely, the gravest impact that flame will have on this ranch is to scar the trunks of several trees and expose the topsoil to the elements, since the carpet of pine needles will inevitably burn off.</p>
<p>I am beginning to see that this selective thinning is entirely necessary to protect both the forest and the family who lives in a house a short distance from the forest. Further, after bringing innumerable trees to an early doom, I am beginning to feel the hunger within my person begin to reverberate. Matt is hungry too, we drive back to the house and call that day’s chores quits.</p>
<p>Later on that night, I am told that I have chanced to arrive on the night of Matt’s older brother’s birthday. There is to be a large family dinner later that night. In the leadup to dinner, I am a curiosity. Matt’s family seems convinced that their particular brand of living – to maintain your land yourself, to ask guests to work for their supper – is so insane as to be repulsive to visitors. They principally cite the example of the last person who went up to their house for the first break of his freshman year, who did not set foot there again until Matt’s brother got married…a short four years later.</p>
<p>As it came to be close to dinnertime, it was interesting to see how people focused exactly on what they were interested. Matt’s little brother scurried about ensuring that the potatoes were hot and the napkins were well adjusted. Matt excitedly played with his little cousin (the only girl in the local unit of their family) while his mother attempted to bring a semblance of order to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Finally, we sat down to eat. I sat at the children’s table and we all joined hands for what I anticipated would be a standard grace. About twelve millionths of a second into a grace that was both nonstandard and jarringly well memorized, I realized both that I was far, far away from home and that a family which was so sure of its extreme dysfunctionality was indeed highly functional. They had successfully put together a large family gathering without conflagration; a rare feat for any family, and they were showing their support for each other in a way that is admirable in modern times. As I sat silently though their grace (which was sung in harmony), I reflected on this and wondered how I would have turned out had my family sung grace at dinner each day. As I finished that thought, a lull came in the grace which I mistook for the ending. I sat down and began to eat, while the family sang “Amen” three times and I burst out laughing. Matt’s older brother looked over at me and said “Maybe next time we’ll say Jewish grace”</p>

<h2 id="stories"><a class="toclink" href="../../2008/11/20/stories/">Stories</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this in my first semester at the College of Idaho. Be nice.</em> </p>
<p>I remember the first time that I began to think I might be a “People” person. The distinction between a “people” person and a non-people person is of course ridiculous – are there people who aren’t also people? – But commonly, one thinks of a people person as one who likes to interact with others.</p>
<p>I’m not a people person in the way that the term is often bandied about: I don’t like to meet hundreds of people for the sheer thrill of remembering how their face looks and what their name is. My favorite thing is to hear their stories. There’s something magical in a story that a stranger tells you. Your narrator is completely unreliable – but unlike literature – he or she is completely scrutable.</p>
<p>A book and a box led me to this realization. The box was a multicolored, ten human sized box operated by an outfit called storycorps in New York City’s Grand Central Station. Literally, it was a box where you would take your grandmother and talk. With the aid of a trained “helper” you would ask her questions that were recorded onto the public record. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this project is that there is no arbiter of what constitutes a valid story and what doesn’t. The stories are as frequently about how great aunt Bessie used to make the best apple pies as they are about the time that granny went to see FDR’s Inauguration when she was just a little girl. This reinforced to me that anyone can be a storyteller, and that given the opportunity, they would talk your ear off.</p>
<p>The second prompt was a book of photos and stories, called “Harvey Wang’s New York”. The book is a collection without plot, sort of a love letter to iconic New Yorkers: They had pictures of the guy who had been running the cyclone on Coney Island for forty-two years. There was this adorable old lady who sold seashells on the upper west side and a waspy woman with huge hair who tells people where to go in the New York public library. The stories of these people made up the fabric of the city I lived in at the time, and after Harvey Wang came to our classroom and explained how easy it was to write the book, I realized that almost anyone can gain access to this fabric if they just ask.</p>
<p>After I realized those two things, I got really annoying for at least a couple of years. I would ask to sit next to people at pizza joints and start talking at them, Most of the time I would get friendly stories in return, but sometimes I would just get blank New Yorker stares. I met Sol Moscot, an optician who is the son of an optician named Sol Moscot. I met Greeks who had lived in Astoria for forty years, and who would tell me how great America was through contrast with Greece excitedly using their young nieces and nephews as interpreters. They had never learned English. I met an African American hairdresser who invited me to hang out in her shop and invited my friend (a white Texan) to get cornrows. She gladly accepted.</p>
<p>I realized that I’m slowly working on my own world: the collection of people that I get to know over time and their collected stories, visages, and thoughts. I hope that the majority of the stories are the kind where immigrants tell me about their lives, rather than the kind where Texans get cornrows. She did not look good in them.</p>

<p><em>I wrote this in my first semester at the College of Idaho.</em></p>
<p>Often, the character of people who live in big cities is impugned by people from small towns. The assumption is often that those from urban areas are somehow “out of touch” with core American values, or somehow corrupted by some evil core of any big city. Similarly, people from small towns are often much maligned by urbanites because they are assumed to be simple and unintelligent.</p>
<p>Perhaps both assumptions are true, perhaps neither. We do know for sure that urban centers tend to be more liberal while rural areas tend to be more conservative. Although there are instances of urban poverty and rural wealth, we can effectively generalize about the economic character of these areas: in general, urban dwellers are much better off since they benefit from more economic exchange.</p>
<p>It is both inaccurate and unfair to generalize further about these areas, however. There are urban libertarians and rural socialists, morally bankrupt cowboys and saintly cab drivers. Perhaps the best way to tackle the question of which is “better” is to approach it from the standpoint of which one is more beneficial to the greater world.</p>
<p>Strictly from a standpoint of conservation, it is almost inarguably beneficial to have people living in large cities. The improved public transportation, recycling, and waste systems alone allow for a much lower-impact way of living. Frequent interaction between people of different races and social classes tends to lead to more tolerant citizens or at least more aware citizens. Further, cities develop a higher concentration of intellectuals, who will tend to support others and beget a culture of intellectualism. The value of this culture of intellectualism is almost incalculable.</p>
<p>Small towns, however “inefficient” will generally have a higher quality of life. Pollution is generally lower, homes more interspersed, and crime significantly less noticeable. People tend to know more people, because small and friendly communities will beget a growing web of acquaintances in a way that a harsh city will not. The issue with these small and tighter-knit communities is that their citizens can tend to be less exposed to cultural diversity and lack a broad world identity. Many people who have moved from big cities, however, have come to call small towns home.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a mix between our need to move to a big city to self educate and our desire to move to a small town to relax and feel at home that might be found. I feel perfectly happy receiving mail in both a small town in Idaho and the largest city in America (New York City). Perhaps there is some interplay between small town values and big city diversity that makes America work, some necessary ebb and flow between the megalopolis and mom-and-pop-olis that begets a more successful America and a happier citizen.</p>
