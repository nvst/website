<h2 id="13-charts-high-yield-today"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/07/09/13-charts-high-yield-today/">13 Charts: High Yield Today</a></h2>
<p><em>This post was written for CFA Institute and coauthored with</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marty-fridson-7891848/"><em>Marty Fridson</em></a><em>, who is one of the most perceptive analysts I have ever met. It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>The standard joke about high-yield bonds is that they’re not high yield any longer.</p>
<p>People started to tell that joke when the high-yield index fell below 10%. They’ve continued revising it as the index has moved steadily downward to its present 6%.</p>
<p>So let’s replace it with a much better joke: A bond manager has to appear in traffic court for a moving violation. The judge asks, “Don’t you know what ‘yield’ means?” The bond manager replies, “It’s been so long since there’s been any, I’ve forgotten.”</p>
<p>The judge begins to lecture him: “It’s every citizen’s duty in our society to understand the laws and obey them. It’s a sacred covenant.” The bond manager interjects, “I didn’t understand that last part.”</p>
<p>This joke evoked a chuckle from the audience at CFA Society New York’s 28th Annual High Yield Bond Conference. Martin Fridson, CFA, has been organizing and moderating the event for its entire history, starting back “when government bonds were yielding 9% and a respectable high yield credit could be found yielding around 14%.” Attendees have come to expect a mix of quirky humor, tactical insight, and portfolio management wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Enterprising Investor</em> and CFA Society New York hope to transmit healthy doses of each through this experimental format.</p>
<p>What follows are 13 charts interspersed with related commentary from panelists throughout the event. To be clear: These quotes are from 13 and 14 June 2018 at the CFA Society of New York. In most cases, the charts and commentary were offered at different times. Participants’ remarks have been edited for clarity, and many rich veins of discussion could not be included due to length considerations.</p>
<p>CFA Society New York has made <a href="https://www.cfany.org/28th-hyb-conference-masterclass/">videos and copies of the presentations available,</a> but the best way not to miss out next year is to attend in person. <a href="https://www.cfany.org/leadership-groups/">CFA Society New York puts on many insightful programs and offers many opportunities to get involved</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“The ability of companies to access the market [since the crisis] led to a large spike in B issuers. There are also a lot more rated issuers in total than 2009.” — <strong>Robert Schulz, CFA, managing director, corporate ratings, S&amp;P Global Ratings</strong></li>
<li>“The investment grade market has grown 40% over the last four years. The HY market has shrunk since 2015, and its overall credit quality has improved.” — <strong>Riz Hussain, director, US high-yield credit strategy, Barclays Capital</strong></li>
<li>“Usually, things are never at the average. When defaults start spiking, they spike to double digits. A ‘non-recessionary’ average default rate for bonds is 2.3%. We don’t see anything at Fitch that leads us to believe the cycle is going to turn into a spike over the next year.” (<em>Editor: <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/site/leveragedfinance/data">Fitch’s work</a> put the high-yield default rate at 1.8% in 2017.</em>) — <strong>Sharon Bonelli, managing director, Fitch Ratings</strong></li>
<li>“There’s no question [default rates] are very low. People talk about this as ‘We’re in the 13th inning of a credit cycle.'” — <strong>George Varughese, managing director, Alvarez &amp; Marsal</strong></li>
<li>“Our view is that money will be shifting from US to a more global situation over the next few years. Right now we’re getting to the unusual position where you don’t have a pickup from local EM into high yield. There’s an embedded view on the dollar, but that opportunity to swap into EM is a pretty compelling one from a total return standpoint.” — <strong>Henry Peabody, CFA, vice president, multi-sector portfolio manager, Eaton Vance Management</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Higher Beta Has Generally Outperformed over the Last 12 Months" src="images/Higher-Beta.png?resize=640%2C495"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“Almost one third of the market was expected to default during the credit crisis because of their near-term maturities. Most companies now want to extend their runways. [They] are going out five, six, seven years. When rates start rising, you wind up getting more tenders. High-yield companies withstand rising rates better than expected because of that.” — <strong>Anne Yobage, CFA, director/co-founder, SKY Harbor Capital Management</strong></li>
<li>“If you think about the financing cycle we’ve had this last few years, high-yield companies have built this incredible runway which means it will take some time for issuers to pay higher coupons. . . . I think the loan index coupon actually fell by 40 basis points this year. . . . [Rising interest rates] will certainly affect lower-quality issuers the most because they have more floating rate notes.” — <strong>Martha Metcalf, CFA, senior portfolio manager, Schroders Investment Management</strong></li>
<li>“The shift we’ve seen over the past year to the Fed not giving you a get-out-of-jail-free card, the ECB not backing down as Italy gets volatility. We’re more nervous about rates than others. We don’t see a 10-year Treasury north of 5% as crazy, and people are asking if there’s value in the front end, if a 2.5% two year is sucking attention away from other credits.” — <strong>Henry Peabody, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“If rates are going up because earnings are going up, most of the market will be just fine. From a total return basis, it gets back to bonds and what’s investable. High yield has a strong record of outperformance when interest rates are rising. Over the past 20 years, there have been 16 50 basis point hike cycles.” — <strong>Kevin Lorenz, CFA, managing director/portfolio manager, TIAA</strong></li>
<li>“This late in the cycle, you’re really down to the relative value argument. The opportunistic buyer has definitely stepped back. Fundamentals are supportive, technicals are in balance, but valuations are stretched here.” — <strong>Martha Metcalf, CFA</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="The Rates Effect" src="images/The-Rates-Effect.png?resize=640%2C491"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>What does a flattening yield curve mean? “The strongest relationship is between 2s10s and the 3yr forward default rate. So the oft-forecast crisis via rates is likely to happen in 2021.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
<li>“Right now, we have to defend the asset category. We’re at historical tights, so a lot of clients think there’s nowhere good to go from here.” — <strong>Anne Yobage, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“We like the B part of the market probably the most. Five to 6%, two- to five-year maturity is our sweet spot.” — <strong>Anne Yobage, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“We’re more focused on B and CCC, but partially offset with investment-grade exposures, because we found that we could find large-cap BBB entities with higher yields than BB. Subordinated paper from [for instance] JP Morgan has more liquidity, plus a [yield] pickup. And in contrast to what we’ve said about high yield, supply in investment grade has been quite good this year.” — <strong>Martha Metcalf, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“You don’t get paid two or three times the Treasury base rate for absolute certainty.” — <strong>Wayne Plewniak, managing director/portfolio manager, Gabelli &amp; Company.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Correlation of Credit Assets with US Treasuries" src="images/Correlation-of-Credit-Assets-with-US-Treasuries.png?resize=640%2C480"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“It used to be that credit had a very tight correlation with rates.” — <strong>Sam Derosa-Farag, market strategist</strong></li>
<li>“We’re quite positive on the credit cycle. We think it still has long legs here. We are very comfortable moving down in credit quality for that reason: We think we’ve experienced much of the major headwinds already in the high-yield market. We are looking for a 5% year for both full duration and short duration products.” — <strong>Anne Yobage, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“We are constructive on high yield overall. From a strategic vantage point, spreads are top-decile narrow, top 30% over the last 20 years. Put those two together and look at it by credit rating. If you back out credit-risk premia, historically BB has provided very strong risk-adjusted returns. We think they will continue to do so.” — <strong>Kevin Lorenz, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“It’s hard to be enthusiastic about valuations. Leverage is extended, even though backward-looking interest coverage is solid. Technicals have been very strong. We do get the sense, at least in the near term, that foreign participation is backing away.” — <strong>Henry Peabody, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“Maybe equity valuations are too high, and if they are, that’s going to be felt across all asset classes.” — <strong>Kevin Lorenz, CFA</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="High Yield New Issue Supply Constrained" src="images/High-yield-new-issue-supply-constrained.png?resize=640%2C484"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“The average high-yield new issue is worse than average because companies come to market opportunistically.” — <strong>Martin Fridson, CFA, chief investment officer, Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors</strong></li>
<li>“You should be willing to move between acting as an owner and acting as a creditor if you are buying these assets.” — <strong>George Varughese</strong></li>
<li>“We cut our forecast for new issue supply by $40B, which puts it as low as it was in 2009–10.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
<li>“We tend to think there’s a pretty good correlation between volatility spikes and slowdowns in the new issuance calendar.” — <strong>Jarrod Kaplan, director, Credit Agricole Securities CIB</strong></li>
<li>“Seventy percent or so of high-yield proceeds has been used for refinancing . . . that’s the highest since 2007.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
<li>“We have the luxury of avoiding the new issue market . . . . Generally what’s new issue today is what you want to buy in one or two years. Bankers aren’t in the business of enriching investors, they work for their clients.” — <strong>Henry Peabody, CFA</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Demand Outpacing Supply Has Meant   " src="images/Demand-Outpacing-Supply.png?resize=640%2C498"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“Seventy-seven percent of the floating-rate loan market is considered ‘covenant lite.’ Leverage through the first lien part of the capital structure is about as high as it’s ever been. Relative to high yield, there are some concerns about credit quality. We’ve seen a 20% increase in capital structures that are loan only, and 58% of loan issuers are loans only. That means a majority of loan issuers today don’t have bonds below them.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
<li>“When [abuses of covenants] happen, the company is simply doing what the documents allow them to do. And shame on us, shame on the investment community, for letting that happen.” — <strong>George Varughese</strong></li>
<li>“The recovery experience will be much different than it’s been historically.” — <strong>Martha Metcalf, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“Back in the mid 2000s, the structures got very esoteric. Each deal was unique. It still worked out in the end. Contrast that to today, where every deal is pretty much boilerplate. But the point that keeps getting made is that cov-lite is going to hurt.” — <strong>Kevin Lorenz, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“You have to really trust that management teams have your interests at heart . . . ” — <strong>Anne Yobage, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“And they don’t.” — <strong>Kevin Lorenz, CFA</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Loans vs Bonds Fair Value Index" src="images/Loans-vs-bonds-fair-value-index.png?resize=640%2C362"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“We invest across bonds and loans. In our mutual fund, loan exposure has ranged from 0 to 20%, and today it’s at 7%. Everything we buy is based on bottom-up credit views. The problem we’ve had in the loan market is one of repricing. It is just getting too rich for us.” — <strong>Kevin Lorenz, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“You’re seeing the most late-cycle behavior in the loan market. It won’t be a catalyst for defaults but it will affect the recovery experience . . . . I heard a CLO manager say that covenants don’t pay coupon, cash flow does.” — <strong>Martha Metcalf, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“Now is an excellent time to be in active management . . . you need to treat the market with caution and go in with a deep fundamental view.” — <strong>Henry Peabody, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“Dispersion is sitting at the lows. Positioning suggests caution. Dealer inventories are basically flat. High-yield CDX positioning is basically flat. Mutual fund manager performance this year is really narrowly distributed.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
<li>“We’ve seen deals in 2018 with a seven-plus year maturity, though still no longer than eight. For instance: Iron Mountain, Vista Energy, Telenet. There’s a continued loosening of terms. The market is getting more aggressive. The depth of the second lien loan market is increasing with large ‘bond-size’ placements readily achievable. Two to $5 billion enterprise value LBOs, where you would tend to need a junior piece to be a high-yield bond, [can now be funded with] first and second lien loans.” — <strong>Jarrod Kaplan</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="ETF Liquidity Enhancement in US Credit" src="images/ETF-Liquidity-Enhancement-in-US-Credit.png?resize=640%2C469"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“HYG and JNK have much higher flow volatility than what the price volatility would suggest. Managers have increasingly been using ETFs to take tactical views, but also to manage liquidity overall. That means you can’t look at ETF flows as additive to mutual fund flows.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
<li>“ETFs are 3.4% of the US HY market. All 45 high-yield ETFs trade 15.7% of 3m average daily volume in total market. The largest premium/discount to underlying was ~.3%/-~.4% on the five most stressed days.” — <strong>Bradley Kotler, vice president, SPDR Fixed Income Group, State Street Global Advisors</strong></li>
<li>“We see ETFs as enhancing the liquidity process. As a seller, you’re getting the greater of the liquidity in the underlying or the ETF.” — <strong>Sal Bruno, chief investment officer, IndexIQ</strong></li>
<li>“On Columbus Day, there was $1 billion in volume for JNK even though the bond market wasn’t open.” — <strong>Bradley Kotler</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Retail Downgrades" src="images/Retail-Downgrades-over-100-downgrades-since-Jan-2017.png?resize=640%2C483"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“We are very underweight retail. We like the telecom space a lot. Basic industries and housing are very strong areas too.” — <strong>Anne Yobage, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“Retail bankruptcies, most of the time, end up in liquidations. Most of the lending to a retail company is typically done on an asset-based basis on inventory and receivables. Because of Amazon and many other things, brick-and-mortar business models are under attack. So when a bankruptcy happens, a secured lender is best able to get a recovery by liquidating the receivables and inventory instead of assuming the business risk. Most of the time the secured creditor wins because they have a lien to the assets. Not true in all cases: Many retail companies have emerged from bankruptcy and continued to be companies afterward.” — <strong>George Varughese</strong></li>
<li>Retail is “the most active in terms of defaults these days, the total 12-month default rate for retail is about 9% on the high-yield side.” — <strong>Sharon Bonelli</strong></li>
<li>“Individual sectors have been strained, but it hasn’t spilled over to the broader market.” — <strong>George Varughese</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Tax Reform Credit Impact Takeaways" src="images/Tax-Reform-Credit-Impact-Takeaways.png?resize=640%2C449"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“I don’t believe we’ve taken many ratings actions based on tax reform.” — <strong>Robert Schulz, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“About 40% of public high-yield issuers have interest coverage below 3.3x. Tax reform means that interest above 30% of EBITDA is no longer deductible. So, some portion of their interest bill will no longer be deductible. But there will be an offsetting effect in the form of a lower tax rate, which means their tax expense will also fall.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
<li>“The most mentioned use of tax saving proceeds [on company earnings calls] was M&amp;A/asset purchases.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="CCC Focus" src="images/CCC-Focus.png?resize=640%2C496"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“There has never been a three-year period where the high-yield market has exceeded its beginning carry. Previously, when we had sub-carry years, CCC meaningfully underperformed while BB outperformed. This year, that’s inverted and CCC has outperformed.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
<li>“CCC also offers a nice premium but is the most volatile and most subject to volatility, so we are less excited about CCC given the run.” — <strong>Kevin Lorenz, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“We want to like the CCC space but you really have to look at the companies there. We find CCC attractive as a ratings category, but don’t like the names.” — <strong>Anne Yobage, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“From 1984 to 1999, CCC bonds were badly behaving citizens. Lots of institutional investors wanted indices that excluded CCC.” — <strong>Sam Derosa-Farag</strong></li>
<li>“Energy rising stars (<em>Editor’s note: that’s the opposite of a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fallenangel.asp">fallen angel</a></em>) are particularly strong. They were 60% of rising star volume in 2017.” — <strong>Riz Hussain</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="BB B and CCC and Lower-Option Spreads" src="images/BB-B-and-CCC-lower-option-spreads.png?resize=640%2C357"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“If a company goes bust, the short-term bond and the long-term bond are both going to default. Maturity does not affect recovery in a bankruptcy. So at the extreme, people will trade a short-term bond and a long-term bond at the same dollar price.” <strong>— Martin Fridson, CFA</strong></li>
<li>But in other circumstances: “do you get a bigger risk premium relative to treasurys in the short or the long end of the high yield market?” <strong>— Martin Fridson, CFA</strong></li>
<li>The first two studies came to opposite conclusions:<ul>
<li>Jerome Fons found wider spreads in short term bonds and narrower spreads in the longer end of the curve. (<a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v50.n5.25?journalCode=faj"><em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>, 1994</a>)</li>
<li>Helwege and Turner looked just at pairs of the same issuer (pari passu) issues of the same name and found that, pretty consistently, spread on shorter-dated maturity of same deal was wider (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0022-1082.00170"><em>Journal of Finance</em>, 1999</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Our study (forthcoming in the <em>Journal of Fixed Income</em>) concludes that it’s not correct to say either that it’s always negative or always positive. We can reject the idea that negatively sloped curves are an illusion based on difference in credit quality among maturity baskets.” <strong>— Martin Fridson, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“Positive spread curves indicate low concern about default risk, and are most frequent in the BB sector.” <strong>— Martin Fridson, CFA</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Average Equity Commitments in LBO Transactions" src="images/Average-Equity-Commitments-in-LBO-transactions.png?resize=640%2C460"/></p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>“There’s been a transfer from high-yield bonds, which used to be the currency to finance LBOs, to leveraged loans. Clearly it could be better, but for a sponsor to put in 40% in equity is a reasonable cushion.” — <strong>George Varughese</strong></li>
<li>“LBOs involve large-scale borrowing to fund the acquisition of the target company, with the stated intention of bringing debt down to manageable levels by the time the next recession hits. We never know when the next recession will arrive, but with each month that elapses since the last recession, we know with certainty that we’re one month closer to the next one. Logically, therefore, the multiples of debt piled on an LBO should decrease as we get closer to the next recession and there is consequently less time to bring leverage down. What we actually observe, however, is that multiples increase as the economy gets closer to the next recession. This cannot be wise corporate financial policy.” — <strong>Martin Fridson, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“Are we late cycle? I’d put it in perspective to the three cycles the modern HY market has experienced. I’ve been a part of each of them. Each correction is cleaning up the excesses of a market cycle. Each time, that’s been LBOs. In 2007, the standard deal almost overnight became 10x leveraged. We’re not at that level yet. The <em>Journal</em> had an article this morning that the average deal was 6x EBITDA . . . that must be adjusted EBITDA. It’s more like 8x or 9x, and then they tell you why it’s really 6x.” — <strong>Kevin Lorenz, CFA</strong></li>
<li>“Two to 5b enterprise value LBOs, where you would tend to need a junior piece be a high-yield bond, are getting funded with first and second lien loans. The depth of the second lien loan market is increasing with large ‘bond-size’ placements readily achievable.” — <strong>Jarrod Kaplan</strong></li>

<p><em>This was coauthored with the excellent</em> <a href="https://gpc.stanford.edu/people" title="Link: https://gpc.stanford.edu/people"><em>Ashby Monk</em></a> <em>and originally published by CFA Institute on</em> <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2018/06/25/you-may-beat-an-algorithm-today-what-about-tomorrow/"><em>the</em></a> <em><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2018/06/25/you-may-beat-an-algorithm-today-what-about-tomorrow/">Enterprising Investor</a>.</em> </p>
<p>Technology will upend the way investment decisions are made.</p>
<p>How should investment decision makers respond?</p>
<p>This conversation has a tendency to assume an emotional tone even before it gets existential. For instance, you hear genuine angst over Microsoft Office’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/microsoft-gives-office-a-refreshed-look-and-feel/" title="Link: https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/microsoft-gives-office-a-refreshed-look-and-feel/">new layout</a>, and that’s just a redesigned application. Innovation has cumulative effects though, and after more than <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/moores-law-technology.html" title="Link: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/moores-law-technology.html">50 years of Moore’s law</a> and numerous other advances, algorithmic decision making fits too tightly into investment processes to be ignored.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it’s perfect. One purpose of this essay is to invite you into friendly competition with an algorithm designed by Ashby Monk and his colleagues at Stanford University. <a href="https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b47e8xhouGOfeLz">Their process can select managers with limited information and little time. You may be able to predict a team’s success more effectively</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not you feel like you beat the machine today, it’s worthwhile to have a plan for what happens next so that your organization can fully capitalize on its native strengths.</p>
<p>In our imagination, the word “algorithm” tends to evoke fast-paced and high-stakes processes.</p>
<p>The mundane truth is that the word refers only to a process or set of rules that describe how to accomplish a task. There is no naturally associated time horizon or risk appetite.</p>
<p>And that’s good, because most public pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds wouldn’t count speed or agility among their strengths.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to underscore that they don’t need to, and explore what a technological transformation looks like when its primary purpose is to reinforce risk-aware patience at institutions that may outlast many of their assets.</p>
<h4 id="know-who-you-are"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/07/03/you-may-beat-an-algorithm-today-what-about-tomorrow/#know-who-you-are"><strong>Know Who You Are</strong></a></h4>
<p>Many organizations have no formalized models or systems for characterizing data or judging data quality.</p>
<p>No matter. Ongoing competition among market participants to exploit new forms of information and data squarely qualifies as an arms race, definable as a situation in which parties are locked in perpetual efforts to outcompete one another without a defined endpoint. And it gets better: You can’t escape. It’s difficult enough to achieve most current risk and performance targets as things are, but alternative datasets and associated analytical techniques are already augmenting the pricing process in many markets.</p>
<p>Transacting in markets you don’t understand is not a recommended practice. The fear is that it may become business as usual for many investment organizations unless they develop an internal capability to assess and integrate alternative data. As we all know: Fear leads to anger and is the path to the dark side.</p>
<p>One manifestation of this is when entities “leap before looking” and obtain datasets without considering the actionability of what they’ve bought. This can lead to efforts that are poorly aligned with organizational capabilities or priorities and offer little long-term value. The wrong purchase can also drive pursuit of shorter payback periods to offset their costs, and so compress the time horizons of decisions made with them.</p>
<h4 id="seek-defensive-defensible-value"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/07/03/you-may-beat-an-algorithm-today-what-about-tomorrow/#seek-defensive-defensible-value"><strong>Seek Defensive, Defensible Value</strong></a></h4>
<p>Accessing novel data should not be a goal in its own right. The idea is to manifest the best possible version of your organization.</p>
<p>Many large investment organizations struggle with innovation for the simple fact that they lack internal agreement about what direction they should go in. The allure of working with alternative data could make it a common point of agreement in the process of building support for new initiatives internally, and the learning from efforts to integrate it can drive significant future innovation.</p>
<p>The work isn’t necessarily all that different from what you do already. For instance, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessing the strength of a potential general partner’s professional and social network with LinkedIn data and news reports of prior deals before committing to their fund. An allocator is likely to have little ex ante clarity about the specific start-up companies in which a venture capitalist will invest, and no control over how it does so once capital is pledged. The quality of the venture capitalist’s likely co-investors, however, may be easier to discern and serve as an indicator of the ultimate riskiness of its portfolio.</li>
<li>Conducting due diligence on candidate direct investments in leisure-related properties — say, hotels or casinos — by assembling online price and ratings histories of possible competitors — think Airbnb, TripAdvisor, or Yelp — or price-series of airfares to that locale.</li>
<li>Controlling reputational risk from investee companies by monitoring controversies about them that arise in social media posts or other localized/unconventional news outlets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The precise tools and techniques of executing those research operations may not yet be clear, but hopefully the practice seems less like a dark art and more like defense.</p>
<p>There’s still a place for present value, probability, and the rest of the <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfa/curriculum/cbok">body of knowledge</a> that characterizes the investment profession. Alternative data just adds new colors and textures to the mosaic of information investors have long been evaluating.</p>
<p>It also argues for a degree of operational openness.</p>
<p>Some of the most compelling implementations of alternative data strategies involve the investment organization itself. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your cost structure is not a simple function of market capitalization by continuously monitoring contracts with external asset managers. Fee structures based on assets under management (AUM) can creep into costs because growth in an account balance does not necessarily reflect manager skill.</li>
<li>Inventive collation and synthesis of documents like e-mails, investment memos, and contracts can uncover precious metadata with insight into communication, culture, negotiation, time allocation, benchmarking, and diligence.</li>
<li>Organizations can map their internal knowledge flows by tracking how internal users query and access documents in organizational databases. This also allows for examinations of typical approaches analysts use in problem solving. More granular visibility into these activities can expose not only areas for improvement, but also help better identify best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone faces technological competition.</p>
<p>Strategically, this means that investment organizations can invest in homegrown sources of technological leverage, and they ought to. If they don’t, the decision should come after a thorough analysis of long-term tradeoffs to the organization.</p>
<p>From these seats, it’s hard to imagine a winning case against it. Data is perhaps the most important input into every investment decision-making process already, and new applications for it are proliferating every day. Unforeseen (and sometimes unidentifiable) risk still hits portfolios frequently. Unrealized efficiencies abound.</p>

<p>I published an essay called <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2018/06/05/eight-charts-india-ascendant/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2018/06/05/eight-charts-india-ascendant/">India Ascendant</a> last week with Navneet Munot, Vikas Khemani, Sunil Singhania, and Saurabh Muhkerjea.</p>
<p>These gentlemen are not that well known outside of India, but are each remarkable individuals who need no introduction there. It was my privilege to welcome each of them to the CFA Society of New York last week along with Dr. Subir Gokharn of the International Monetary Fund and Dr. Punita Komar-Sinha of Pacific Paradigm Advisors. </p>
<p>My hair was a little frizzy thanks to summer in New York, but the two panels I moderated went very well otherwise. I've embedded a few action shots below, and you can view a recording of the panel <a href="https://www.cfany.org/india-2018-opportunity-calling/">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>This essay was written for CFA Institute in collaboration with four gentlemen who know the Indian investment landscape better than anyone:</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabh-mukherjea-cfa-36196b2/"><em>Saurabh Muhkerjea</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikas-khemani-08a0644/?originalSubdomain=in"><em>Vikas Khemani</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/sunilbsinghania?lang=en"><em>Sunil Singhania</em></a><em>, and</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/navneet-munot-0b62ab6/?originalSubdomain=in"><em>Navneet Munot</em></a><em>. It was first published by the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>India’s economy will experience the ordinary progress of a century over the next decade.</p>
<p>That sentence is as true now as it was in 1952 when Donald B. Macurda wrote of investment opportunities in India for <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v8.n5.29">the CFA Institute <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>The appeal was humanitarian, but also prophetic.</p>
<p>He wrote that the country “should logically become one of the world’s great steel centers,” and today it is. The prediction that “the Indian industrial ball will gather an accelerating momentum that could be enriching to all concerned” has also aged well.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is nothing if not an accelerating return. <a href="https://t.co/JaOxyUdeZ8">pic.twitter.com/JaOxyUdeZ8</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/1001851897068818434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>This is because of pro-growth policy, not political personality.</p>
<p>India’s economic liberalization was really sparked <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/staffp/2002/03/pdf/cerra.pdf">during a balance of payments crisis in 1991</a>. Ten years later, the Asian Development Bank’s chief economist <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ap2231/Policy%20Papers/OPB2.pdf">observed</a> that the need for continued work had become an item of widespread political consensus. To place the change in context, consider that the weighted average tariff on an imported product was 76% in 1990 <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TM.TAX.MANF.WM.AR.ZS?locations=IN">according to the World Bank</a>. It was 29% a decade later, and 6.2% in 2016.</p>
<p>That’s more a rebirth than a liberalization.</p>
<p>These compounding efforts have a straightforward result: India isn’t playing catch-up anymore. It’s the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/the-worlds-biggest-economies-in-2018/">world’s seventh-largest economy</a>, and in some ways it’s already well ahead of “developed” places.</p>
<p>In early 2017, <a href="http://srvo.org/1328800">Sloane Ortel estimated</a> that a minimum wage earner in New York City spends 1.5% to 2.5% of their discretionary income on banking fees. In India, anything above 0% is an outlier. The <a href="https://www.pmjdy.gov.in/">Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY, Scheme for People’s Wealth)</a> provides not just free bank accounts to all citizens, but also free overdraft insurance. That makes capital formation easier, and it’s just one of a few hundred reasons why 8% GDP growth seems plausible for the next 20 years.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Indian inflation has bottomed, and looks likely to rise further. <a href="https://t.co/LabNtgQMqi">pic.twitter.com/LabNtgQMqi</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/1001852848131407872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>So don’t be surprised if the economy starts running a little hot.</p>
<p><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi">India’s inflation rate</a> printed below 2% in the summer of 2017, but has since risen significantly. The <a href="http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/press_release/CPI_PR_14may18.pdf">most recent release</a> puts consumer prices up 4.58% from a year ago, and the year-on-year change has been well above the RBI’s target of 4% since November of last year.</p>
<p>The 1 July 2017 introduction of the national Goods and Services Tax (GST) is not least among its drivers. The 18% tax it collects on services is a significant hike from the 14.5% duty that was previously imposed on 28% of the CPI basket.</p>
<p>Fiscal policy is also likely to be accommodative until elections to India’s lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, in spring 2019. Local and national government social and infrastructure spending tends to spike in these pre-election periods.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">India's manufacturers face a crude reality. <a href="https://t.co/JwiWxVHTTT">pic.twitter.com/JwiWxVHTTT</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/1001853792516820992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>And of course, there are commodity prices.</p>
<p>India imports 86% of its crude oil requirement: about 1.5 billion barrels each year. That means rising crude prices have nearly a one-on-one impact on India’s import bill.</p>
<p>It’s less stark than it seems at first. <a href="https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/hs92/2710/">Refined petroleum is India’s largest single export</a>. The country sent 207 million barrels abroad in 2016, making it the world’s fifth-largest supplier behind the Netherlands and netting $29.5 billion, 9% of the country’s total export trade.</p>
<p>For the Indian consumer, oil prices never fell. The government responded to the 2015 selloff by raising taxes on diesel and petrol. This increases reserves and can always be cut in the future. It’s also a footnote compared to some of the government’s other policy reforms.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is what an economic transformation looks like. <a href="https://t.co/a3RtgqrcTa">pic.twitter.com/a3RtgqrcTa</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/1001867867552436224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>The informal sector accounts for roughly 40% of India’s 2017 output and employs almost 80% of its labor force.</p>
<p>The government seems determined to get rid of it.</p>
<p>India has digitized its financial plumbing, cracked down on cash, and issued a new national tax scheme largely to tamp out “black” money, or untaxed earnings on the black market. Many of these businesses are relatively low quality, and can be expected to lose share or cease operating without the ability to flout wage laws and avoid taxes.</p>
<p>This is a tailwind for listed companies. Market leading franchises have long been gaining share from these informal operators. Soon they will operate in a uniform national market with much less illicit competition.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Indians are starting to discover their domestic capital markets.<br/><br/>Chart via <a href="https://twitter.com/SunilBSinghania?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SunilBSinghania</a> <a href="https://t.co/o5OHkdVjzR">pic.twitter.com/o5OHkdVjzR</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/1001868983694495744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>The money habits of individual Indians are also headed for a significant change.</p>
<p>About 95% of India’s wealth is invested in physical assets: 77% in real estate with the balance in durable goods (7%), and gold (11%).</p>
<p>The remaining 5% is invested in financial assets. This share is already growing and looks set to go further. Households put 45% of their income into financial assets in 2012. The proportion is now around 58% and looks poised for more expanision.</p>
<p>This will materially strengthen India’s capital account if it continues.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Not all borrowers pay their bills. <a href="https://t.co/2fXRs1KUSX">pic.twitter.com/2fXRs1KUSX</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/1001874341565517826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>There are risks to the rosy outlook, of course.</p>
<p>A primary one is the sometimes lackluster credit discipline of Indian lenders. “India’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ada8f680-f32e-11e6-8758-6876151821a6">bad loan</a>/<a href="http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2016-17/echap04.pdf">twin balance-sheet problem</a> is widely known and so far intractable,” <a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/03/03/2185444/the-beginning-of-a-blueprint-for-a-bad-bank-in-india/">David Keohane wrote</a> last year.</p>
<p>Historically, Indian companies have been weighed down by debt-laden balance sheets and the public sector banks that have financed them have been saddled with non-performing assets. In large part, this is because India’s bankruptcy code did not make it easy for creditors to reach economically viable arrangements. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016 has materially strengthened the insolvency framework with an efficient legal structure to enforce debt service obligations.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to overstate the importance of this. The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) <a href="http://www.asifma.org/uploadedFiles/Resources/ASIFMA%20-%20India%E2%80%99s%20Debt%20Markets%20The%20Way%20Forward(1).pdf">estimated</a> that India’s corporate bond market was worth about 15% of  GDP in 2017. That’s tripled from 5% five years earlier, but is still much lower than neighboring Malaysia, where outstanding corporate bonds were worth 40% of GDP. Deepening this market will help to finance much-needed infrastructure projects and also provide banks with a bit more breathing room.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to hope it works, but it may be a process. About two weeks ago, a Reuters headline blared, “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/24/reuters-america-analysis-india-state-banks-bailout-stumbles-as-losses-mount.html">India State Banks’ Bailout Stumbles as Losses Mount</a>.” And Moody’s <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/moodys-cuts-indias-gdp-forecast-to-7-3-from-7-5/articleshow/64383255.cms">just cut</a> their estimate for India’s 2018 GDP, citing a combination of higher oil prices and tighter financial conditions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Accounting quality drives investment performance in India. <a href="https://t.co/GZyRubg2qr">pic.twitter.com/GZyRubg2qr</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/1001876815361822722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>And then there’s the same old risk: Investing is hard.</p>
<p>Finding multibagger investments in India is a tricky affair because accounting quality and corporate governance standards vary wildly across companies and over 60% of the market cap of the frontline index, the NIFTY, is in highly regulated sectors like banks, telecoms, metals, power, infrastructure, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>However, India had 5,615 listed companies in 2017, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LDOM.NO?year_high_desc=false">according to the World Bank</a>. That’s more than any other market on the planet: The United States had just 4,336. The top decile of these firms has historically delivered 10-times returns over 10-year horizons.</p>
<p>That’s a 25% compound annual growth rate. Foreign investors have participated in this growth story enthusiastically, which has kept India among the most expensive emerging markets based on trailing price/earnings multiples.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There's plenty of room for India's corporate profits to grow.<br/><br/>Chart via <a href="https://twitter.com/SunilBSinghania?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SunilBSinghania</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZlzvR8kbRr">pic.twitter.com/ZlzvR8kbRr</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/1001879854311145473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>The standard question to ponder towards the conclusion of an article like this is: What inning are we in?</p>
<p>In India, though, the game is cricket, not baseball. One inning can last as long as four baseball games, and there are either two or four of them. The <a href="http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/longest-cricket-test-match-history-played-between-south-africa-and-england-durban">longest game in history</a> lasted nine days. And that’s really the point. An allocator encountering India today faces an unusual and alluring confluence of factors. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/c0db0a48-01f2-4ba9-ad01-226fd5678111">has only an 8.5%</a> weighting to this fast-growing, cyclically attractive, and tailwind-laden economy.</p>
<p>The outlook is strong enough that we’ve gotten almost to the end before mentioning India’s <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2018/01/11/nine-reasons-india-is-heading-for-a-lifetime-of-growth/">outrageously favorable demographics, swift digital rebirth, and booming middle class</a>.</p>
<p>That’s because we’re not done talking yet.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you ought to check out the panel discussion convened by CFA Society New York one week after we published this essay. We were joined by Dr. Punita-Singh Kumar of Pacfic Paradigm Advisors and Dr. Subir Gokharn of the International Monetary Fund.

<h2 id="billions-of-reasons-to-be-yourself"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/05/04/billions-of-reasons-to-be-yourself/">Billions of Reasons to Be Yourself</a></h2>
<p>Showtime’s <a href="http://www.sho.com/billions"><em>Billions</em></a> is one of the best shows on television.</p>
<p>It blends excellent storytelling, great acting and writing, and a keen sense for its focal point, Axe Capital, a Connecticut hedge fund.</p>
<p>We don’t often see fund management on the small screen. But <em>Billions</em> has also brought something else unusual: Asia Kate Dillon’s portrayal of Taylor Mason.</p>
<p>Both the character and the person who plays them is non-binary, meaning they don’t identify as either male or female. What’s striking about this is not just the <a href="http://variety.com/2017/tv/awards/asia-kate-dillon-billions-acting-non-binary-choices-showtime-1202454977/#!">boundary-busting</a> they’ve done, but also the speed with which their colleagues accept their identity, pronouns, and personhood. When Taylor comes out to their boss, the reaction is “<a href="http://variety.com/2017/tv/awards/asia-kate-dillon-billions-acting-non-binary-choices-showtime-1202454977/">You know, the difference in you is actually your advantage</a>.”</p>
<p>So where is the real-life Taylor? I’d wager the answer is simple: hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>There is tremendous pressure to keep what makes us different a secret in the workplace. NYU School of Law and Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/about-deloitte/us-inclusion-uncovering-talent-paper.pdf">surveyed</a> 3,129 professionals and found that 61% take action to cover up at least one element of their personality, whether that means straightening their hair to de-emphasize race, avoiding discussions about motherhood to appear more committed at work, or refraining from bringing a same-sex partner to a work function.</p>
<p>The authors also found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“45 percent of straight White men — who have not been the focus of most inclusion efforts — reported covering. This finding seems particularly promising, given that a model of inclusion should, almost by definition, be one in which all individuals can see themselves.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’ll take more than saying it to make it so, but it’s a start. Why does that problem seem so hard, though? Being effective takes empathy no matter who you work with. But too often human beings are met with raised eyebrows instead of open arms when they find the courage to stop covering.</p>
<p>That’s too bad, and not just for the people left to go it alone. Monocultural firms can only scale so far. And when co-workers see a colleague separate from their employer because of a characteristic, the best-case scenario is that they just feel a little uneasy as a result. The worst is that such action allows bias to calcify into blindness or even bigotry.</p>
<p>When I <a href="http://srvo.org/out">came out</a> to my colleagues as a transgender woman in October of last year, one of the things I said was, “If you can respect me as a human, seeing me as a woman is a matter of time.”</p>
<p>That time has come quickly, and my boldest hope is that it will come for you if you’d like it to. I know what it’s like to feel my dignity is contingent on keeping my immutable characteristics secret. It hurt the whole time I was trying, and I’ve never been gladder to give something up.</p>
<p>Everyone ought to be so lucky no matter what they don’t feel able to say. But how to help them out? For a start, here are five great links about diversity and inclusion in investment management:</p>

<p>I also think these five pieces are worth your time:</p>
