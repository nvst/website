<h2 id="economic-thinking-thats-ready-for-retirement"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/05/26/economic-thinking-thats-ready-for-retirement/">Economic Thinking That's Ready for Retirement</a></h2>
<p>If I win, you lose.</p>
<p>It’s an insight that anybody who’s spent time on a playground has had at some point or another. And for a broad spectrum of human activity, it’s completely correct. Most games have winners and losers. And usually, wanting to win promotes good behavior.</p>
<p>I’ve been both a player and a coach, and I have never found a better approach than <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/building-better-athletes-with-more-sleep/382019/">getting enough sleep</a>, <a href="http://www.olympic.org/documents/reports/en/en_report_833.pdf">eating right</a>, and showing up ready to work hard. If you’re having fun, the rest is detail. And healthy competition tends to encourage exactly this sort of good behavior.</p>
<p>But there is only so much you can learn from the playground, and unfortunately, there is an all-too-common tendency to apply schoolyard logic in places where it has no bearing, such as international trade.</p>
<p>So, I was glad to see that when we asked <em>CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</em> readers which of four economic ideas is most ready for retirement, a plurality (42%) of 675 respondents chose the notion that one country’s growth is another country’s lost opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>That is not how things work.</strong></p>
<p>For one, considering economic trends in the context of countries winning and losing is about as cutting-edge as mercantilism, which institutionalized such analysis.</p>
<p>As the fall in oil prices reminded us over the past two years, sometimes it really is the case that nobody is in control. Winds blow, and some countries are better placed to harness them than others. Indeed, too much focus on winning can cause the analyst to believe a sovereign is at its strongest <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/twilight-the-petrostate-16235">just as the weather shifts</a>.</p>
<p>It can also give rise to protectionism, a force today’s leaders seem unable to resist despite repeated (and increasingly humiliating) protestations to the contrary. Following a November 2008 G–20 summit in Washington, D.C., world leaders released a <a href="http://www.cfr.org/financial-crises/statement-g-20-summit-november-2008/p17778">statement</a> underscoring “the critical importance of rejecting protectionism and not turning inward in times of financial uncertainty.”</p>
<p>This was reiterated again by the same group in 2009, with a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2009/pdf/g20_040209.pdf">communique</a> that read, “We will not repeat the historic mistakes of protectionism of previous eras”.</p>
<p>That sentiment lasted for about a minute. A 2012 report titled “<a href="http://www.globaltradealert.org/11th_GTA_report">Débâcle</a>,” by <a href="http://www.globaltradealert.org/">Global Trade Alert</a>, provides a good summary of how what was done differed from what was said.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert: It did, a lot.</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/549028/EXPO_STU(2015)549028_EN.pdf">2015 report</a> for the European parliament’s think tank, authors Roberta Barone and Roberto Bendini laid to rest any hope that world leaders had actually stayed true to their word, writing: “Unfortunately, this pledge to refrain from adopting new trade-restrictive measures — and to roll-back those in place — has not been honored. For the sixth year, the global institutions monitoring protectionism in the G–20 have confirmed the accumulation of new trade-restrictions and few efforts to liberalise trade.”</p>
<p>Now stop for a second and think. How did the preceding couple of paragraphs read to you: like good news? Bad? You’re wrong in either case. In particular if you’re a die-hard free-trader, I would encourage you to examine <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w21906">what happens to labor markets as business adapts</a> to the sorts of sudden trade shocks that come from low-priced foreign competition.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that a good long-term plan to nurture a domestic industry might involve some tariffs or trade restrictions at some point. The excellent (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silent-War-Business-Battles-Americas/dp/0679728279/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464203058&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=silent+war+business">and now basically free</a>) book <em>The Silent War: Inside the Global Business Battles Shaping America’s Future</em> details some cases in which governments have deployed restrictive policies to develop the groundwork for future economic miracles.</p>

<p><strong>Which economic idea is most ready for retirement?</strong>
<img alt="Which economic idea is most ready for retirement" src="images/Which-economic-idea-is-most-ready-for-retirement.png?resize=640%2C335"/></p>
<hr/>
<p>The second-place finisher in our poll, with 28% of the vote, was the premise that free market competition always creates positive outcomes. I’ve got a little statue of a bull on my desk right next to my nameplate, and am generally inclined to be in favor of markets  — but they can be shortsighted sometimes. Some current examples of objectionable activity we can thank free market competition for: <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/e-cigarette-ads-target-millions-kids-cdc-says-n490601">marketing e-cigarettes to children</a>, <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-05-peru-declares-mercury-poison-emergency.html">unregulated gold mines dumping mercury into Amazon rivers</a>, and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/babyview-ultrasound-clinic-pickering-provincial-regulation-1.3589897" title="Link: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/babyview-ultrasound-clinic-pickering-provincial-regulation-1.3589897">ultrasound clinics in Ontario that show you stock photos instead of your baby</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these each seem like open-and-shut cases where regulatory attention is warranted. But it’s important to remember that something is lost every time something is regulated, and it’s deeply tricky to effectively police what should not be done without stamping out activity that could have been productive. I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to suggest that a child could needlessly die because these fly-by-night ultrasound clinics prevented parents from recognizing that a pregnancy is in trouble. And their presence erodes trust in generally hardworking medical professionals. But it’s not trivial to eliminate them (or any of these other practices) without creating bottlenecks. Unfortunately, “prudent regulation” does not have the curb appeal of “free markets.”</p>
<p><strong>Emergent themes.</strong></p>
<p>The last two responses nearly split the balance of the vote, with the premise that individuals need paid employment to contribute to society receiving 15% and the thought that GDP is the best measure of a country’s economic activity getting 15%.</p>
<p>This makes sense: they are quite related. Both augur in one way or another for some means of evaluating activity that is not denominated in currency. The shortcomings of GDP are documented well enough that the European Commission has a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/key_quotes_en.html" title="Link: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/key_quotes_en.html">page dedicated to quotes enumerating them</a> as part of their “<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/index_en.html">Beyond GDP</a>” initiative.</p>
<p>It also may surprise you to note that it’s not a measure as deeply baked into history as, say, profitability or revenue. <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=GDP&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2CGDP%3B%2Cc0">A quick search of published books</a> shows that GDP experienced a sharp upswing in usage during the 1990s, rather than the sustained level of interest that you might expect.</p>
<p>The premise that we should detach a job from the notion of one’s economic value is also gaining significant steam, with interest in a so-called “basic income” even reaching <a href="https://www.janus.com/bill-gross-investment-outlook" title="Link: https://www.janus.com/bill-gross-investment-outlook">Bill Gross’s latest investment outlook</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/wiki/index" title="Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/wiki/index">Here</a> is a great summary of what that entails.</p>

<h2 id="think-different-but-be-right"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/05/13/think-different-but-be-right/">Think Different, But Be Right</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>Here’s a crazy idea: If you want to perform better than everyone else, start by doing something different from them.</p>
<p>This should be intuitive, but it’s not exactly easy. If clients are asking what you’ve done for them lately and your competitors are turning in great performances, it takes serious fortitude to stick to your special difference.</p>
<p>But the promise of such a strategy is significant, according to <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/rupal-j-bhansali/" title="Link: https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/rupal-j-bhansali/">Rupal J. Bhansali</a>, executive vice president and chief investment officer for global equities at Ariel Investments. While she says implementing such a process promises a stroll down the “path of most resistance,” I would be a little bit disappointed if that turned you off to the approach.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is simple: If you’re a professional investor, your job is to turn effort into alpha.</p>
<p>So you better work.</p>
<p>But there are things you can do to make your life easier. For starters, don’t waste time on looking into businesses that don’t meet one of your core criteria. Bhansali uses a process of elimination, screening out companies with unattractive characteristics so that an attractive opportunity set “rises to the top like cream over milk.”</p>
<p>Bhansali works to avoid investments that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are only optically cheap. This makes sense. As Bhansali says, “Markets don’t reward trading on information that everybody else has,” and headline metrics like P/E ratio are the poster children for information that everyone else has access to. Instead, derive a solid estimate for value based on the business itself.</li>
<li>Employ creative accounting. This doesn’t mean fraud. Bhansali focuses on avoiding “accounting chicanery,” which boils down to a business getting ahead of itself in its financial statements.</li>
<li>Derive returns from a low-quality business. We’ve all seen companies that are making money through a byzantine mix of macro tailwinds, cheap leverage, and dumb luck. Life is too short to try and make money there. As Bhansali says, “low quality businesses will compound your problems, not your returns.”</li>
<li>Have a weak balance sheet. Why take the risk? “Don’t forget, we are equity investors,” Bhansali says. “We are at the bottom of the cap structure. We have an option value in the business only if there’s something left over. If there’s nothing left over and debt holders claim a lot of the value of the company, then that option is worthless.”</li>
<li>Are likely to revert to the mean. Lots of businesses are cyclical, and at the top of the cycle there is always a hope that they’ve managed to change their fundamental nature.</li>
<li>Mules do not change into thoroughbreds. Channeling Henry Kissinger, Bhansali notes that “hope is not a strategy.”</li>
<li>Are about to be disrupted. Ignoring the competitive threat from a new potential entrant is a bit like hoping for a return to the flat world. Bhansali reminds us that “Amazon nixed brick and mortar. Shale fracking broke the nexus between oil and gas.” Don’t be casual about the risk that the world changes and leaves your favorite investment in the dust.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>All of this is great advice, and the sort of thing that you might expect to hear about from a CFA Institute staffer. I like to think folks would be a little weirded out if we were suggesting paying attention to only headline P/E multiples and investing in companies that were about to be disrupted.</p>
<p>The crux of pulling off this process is the contrarian bit. As Bhansali notes, there is no payoff in seeing something that everybody else saw too. So instead, look for situations where the “bad news is priced in, but the good news is not.” This is easier said than done. Not only is it a hard problem for you, the analyst, to actually come up with a set of compelling ideas, it’s tough to get your clients to stick with you long enough to find out that your research was good.</p>
<p>On this, Bhansali had a really useful suggestion: “You need to tell people that what you are serving is fine dining, not fast food.” Remind them not to measure your performance after five minutes, since the meal won’t even be cooked yet.</p>
<p>And while you’re at it, you might remind them that eating nothing but fast food is a terrible long-term strategy.</p>

<p>If you’re on social media just trying to get famous, stop.</p>
<p>Many investment professionals are naturally competitive people, myself included. Accustomed to being benchmarked and trained to quantify impact, we run an unusual risk of thinking that social media is a contest.</p>
<p>But applying that perspective is counterproductive. It’s a bit like going to a dinner party and trying to keep score. People might be into it if you have strange friends, but there’s a better chance that you will alienate everyone there.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>During a panel conversation, “How Social Media Is Changing Financial Services (and How to Adapt),” at the <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/">69th CFA Institute Annual Conference</a>, <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/marissa-pick/">Marissa Pick</a>, director of social media at CFA Institute; <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/michael-batnick-cfa/">Michael Batnick, CFA,</a> director of research at <a href="http://www.ritholtzwealth.com/">Ritholtz Wealth Management</a>; and <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/tadas-viskanta/">Tadas Viskanta</a>, founder and editor of <em><a href="http://abnormalreturns.com/">Abnormal Returns</a></em>, gave their perspectives on social media’s value proposition and how to best leverage the technology. It turns out it’s not rocket science.</p>
<p><strong>Show Up Looking to Learn</strong></p>
<p>Only 29% of respondents to an audience poll said that they use social media as part of their research process. That came as a surprise. Social media can be a critical information-gathering tool. Research from MIT Sloan indicates that <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-twitter-users-can-generate-better-ideas/">users who follow a diverse network of experts on Twitter come up with measurably better ideas</a>.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that starting a Twitter account is a magic bullet. Following a given Kardashian won’t do much for you, and the behaviors discussed in the paper are good ideas in general: Pay attention to a wide range of informed views.</p>
<p>And I don’t mean views on which direction stocks are going to move. Both Viskanta and Batnick agreed that reading forecasts and stock picks is the least interesting part of using Twitter. There are plenty of other things to share! For instance, <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1970/01/00/hedge_fund/pdf.html">here’s an article</a> Batnick highlighted detailing the struggles of the hedge fund industry . . . in 1969.</p>
<p>Isn’t that more interesting than 140 characters about somebody’s favorite trade? One of the things that is hard to understand for people who are new to social media is that it’s important to always keep your audience in mind. A given trade recommendation will only be compelling to a small number of people who share your time frame and investment beliefs. Information is much more interesting than recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>But Don’t Forget Conversations!</strong></p>
<p>Viskanta also made an important point: Social media is certainly a broadcast medium, but it is more than just that. Remember the analogy about the dinner party? It’s considered bad manners to remain completely silent during dinner, and for good reason: It’s kind of a weird thing to do.</p>
<p>Part of the magic of social media, Viskanta noted, is that it really is a conversation. This is a truism that cynics often ignore. There are lots of silly things being said about social media. Look no further than AOL’s  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_AODNLJDEI">“Digital Prophet” Shingy</a>. And though <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/17/crystal-ball-3">it’s fun to read</a> about an over-the-top evangelist of a trend you don’t understand and dismiss it, it is far from productive.</p>
<p>Instead, think about what it means that these tools exist. At minimum, it means that you can ask that question that popped into your head. It also means that you probably should. When you respond on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, whatever, it may feel like you are responding to words. But really you are responding to a person. People react well when you respond thoughtfully to something that they wrote or said. I know it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.</p>
<p>But a lot can come from a conversation, so it’s worth remembering that you can do more with your interaction than just make someone feel good. For instance, Viskanta played a big role in my own professional development just by doing his thing. In the early days of my investment career, I relied immensely on his curation to get a handle on who and what was interesting. And years later, I was able to tell him that to his face over dinner.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn’t know that until I told him, and there was a 9- or 10-year lag between when I started reading <em>Abnormal Returns</em> and when I was finally able to thank Tadas in person for the early career solid he did for me. Over that time, he’s evolved his offering considerably, but he’s stayed consistent and true to himself.</p>
<p><strong>If You Do One Thing, Make It That</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the platform or platform combination that you choose to adopt or the content that you choose to engage with, it bears repeating that you won’t create much value for yourself if you’re not doing something you actually find valuable. There is no sense trying to score internet points by getting LinkedIn likes or Twitter hearts. Concentrate instead on trying to learn things from others that will elevate your ability to serve your clients.</p>
<p>Batnick <a href="https://twitter.com/willortel/status/729373648566419457">recommended</a> a few Twitter accounts to follow, and I agree with all of his recommendations. Simply going in and reading a few tweets from each of these handles is a good start. Keeping up with <a href="http://abnormalreturns.com/" title="Link: http://abnormalreturns.com/">Viskanta’s work</a> is also a great way to see longer-form commentary from all kinds of different sources to get a better sense of what most interests you.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools and plenty of social networks, but if you’re just getting started and primarily looking to learn, there really is nowhere better than Twitter. It may be ironic that a network that emphasizes brevity and immediacy has evolved into tremendously useful tool for long-term investors. But that doesn’t make it untrue.</p>

<h2 id="confused-yet-convinced-the-market-view-of-financial-technology"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/05/07/confused-yet-convinced-the-market-view-of-financial-technology/">Confused, Yet Convinced: The Market View of Financial Technology</a></h2>
<p><em>This was written for (and first published by) CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>If you want to test yourself as an analyst, decide that technology is going to change the investment business, and then set out to understand exactly how.</p>
<p>There are a number of trends that cross over from technology. AirBnB, now effectively one of the world’s largest hotels, owns none of the real estate it offers. Uber has gained immense market share by streamlining the annoying process of getting a cab… and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/16/uber-worlds-biggest-ride-sharing-company-no-drivers">by the way, they don’t employ any drivers</a>.</p>
<p>Will the investment services of the future use no money? It’s not a crazy question. Some of the highest profile financial technology companies operate on precisely that premise. So-called “marketplace” lenders, like Lending Club and On Deck Capital, aim to bring suppliers and consumers of capital together on the same platform, set appropriate interest rates based on risk, and service the loans throughout their lives.</p>
<p>These companies have grown immensely, but to critics they still have a lot to prove. Today <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/lc">Lending Club</a> and <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ondk">On Deck Capital</a> change hands for less than 35% of their IPO prices, and there is a reason for that. The institutional investors who were funding the loans made by these platforms have gotten less enthusiastic about supplying capital. And that means the lenders’ business models will need to evolve. As Fitch Ratings puts it, the firms are confronting “<a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/site/fitch-home/pressrelease?id=1002352">market realities</a>.”</p>
<p>Optimism was once at a fever pitch. About eighteen months ago, I spoke with four different funds in a single week who all had more than a quarter of their portfolios invested in Lending Club loans. This was surprising, since they were as different as one could imagine, and hadn’t done much else in credit until finding the platform. But it was easy to use, and offered them an exposure that was hard to find elsewhere without going through scores of intermediaries.</p>
<p>So we have two realities that apply to the same companies: passionate users with good reasons to like the product, and stock charts that go from top left to bottom right. What the heck is going on? Should we be worried about the future of this category?</p>
<p><a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/ashby-monk/">Ashby Monk</a>, executive and research director of the Stanford Global Projects Center, considered this question a few weeks ago in <em>Institutional Investor</em>. His answer: “<a href="http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/blogarticle/3544456/peer-pressure-p2p-lending-poised-to-shake-up-credit/banking-and-capital-markets-banking.html">Nah</a>.” The thinking is that what we’re seeing is really growing pains as marketplace lenders evolve to find more stable pools of capital to support themselves. As many have learned over time, counting on continued favor from the hedge fund community is a great way to be disappointed.</p>
<p>In contrast, large institutional investors can be slow slow to embrace change, but think in decades and centuries. They are also continuously looking to deploy capital and increasingly attentive to the fees their intermediaries feast upon.</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that pension funds looking to invest in loans would seek out ways to invest in them directly. The experience of the firms that have come to market so far may not actually tell us much about the validity of that premise, since a sufficiently large fund might even set up their (fully vertically integrated) program with its own constraints and objectives. Success then becomes somewhat personal, and difficult to judge from the comfort of your keyboard.</p>
<p>It’s not without irony that this version of the financial future is rather apart from the one brought to us by Uber and AirBNB. For one thing, what we are contemplating is a world where technology services employ a tremendous amount of their own capital. For another, this is just one possible future.</p>

<p>When you read up on philanthropy, you hear one word an awful lot: impact.</p>
<p>Obviously that makes sense. If you just want to make someone’s life better, buy me a Jet Ski. If you want to have as big a positive impact on the world as possible, you are starting down an interesting, under-traveled, and complicated road.</p>
<p>There is a spectrum of causes you can support, ranging from the sublime and spiritual to the frivolous. You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad/description" title="Link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad/description">help a guy make potato salad</a>, <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">support a local museum</a>, or <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">save somebody’s life</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, one of these things is not like the other. And that should serve to clarify the stakes. But even charities with the same objectives can differ widely in terms of their effectiveness. Last month, Eric Friedman, CFA, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/03/15/a-greater-misuse-of-charitable-donations-than-fraud/">made the point</a> that some charities can make life-saving interventions for a fraction of the cost of other organizations.</p>
<p>So, by using the right approach, you can save more than 600 lives for the cost of one. Conservatively.</p>
<p>That sort of gap in performance denotes opportunity for investors, both in optimizing personal giving and in helping clients achieve the same efficiency. Friedman and I connected over email to take the discussion a bit further, but certainly the hope is that it does not end here. We would both appreciate it if you would share your own questions in the comments section below.</p>
<p><strong>Will Ortel: One of the most influential concepts in investing is the idea of “efficient” markets, which basically states that it is difficult to beat the market because the best investment opportunities are spotted quickly and buyers bid up the price to fair value. Does this same principle apply in charitable giving?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eric Friedman, CFA:</strong> Somewhat, but not as much as in investments. A lot of donor money goes to the nonprofits that are best at fundraising, not necessarily those with the best programs.</p>
<p>Fundraising success is more correlated with being able to tell compelling stories rather than being charities with evidence-based programs demonstrated to have a strong impact. Further, donors often constrain their giving to areas that they relate to, so causes that are not personally appealing to upper-middle-class and wealthy donors tend to be neglected.</p>
<p>As a result, there are broad swaths of extremely effective charities that have huge funding gaps.</p>
<p>There are some very savvy donors trying to close these gaps, but they are small relative to the total amounts donated. For example, grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is one of the most sophisticated donors and <a href="http://foundationcenter.org/findfunders/topfunders/top100assets.html">the largest foundation by far</a>, are only about 1% of the size of <a href="http://givingusa.org/">what Americans donate annually</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investors frequently complain about not having access to enough information in making investment decisions. The same complaint is probably relevant for charities, but can you compare the information that decision makers use in both contexts?</strong></p>
<p>A key difference between information available to investors and donors is that the regulatory environment for information-sharing is much stricter for investments. For example, mutual funds have to disclose many things about their strategies, and their marketing material is tightly controlled to minimize their ability to over-promise or mislead. Investment firms typically can’t highlight a single winning position without disclosing their whole portfolio performance.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said about charities. While that might make donors cautious, there are also reasons to be more optimistic about the quality of information available.</p>
<p>In the for-profit sector, participants protect their trade secrets and competitive advantages. In contrast, participants in the not-for-profit sector have aligned interests — making the world better — so there is greater potential for sharing information.</p>
<p>In both investing and donating, there are experts who are professionally skilled at identifying the best places to allocate capital. One of the biggest differences is that in the investment world, those experts often guard that information as trade secrets, while experts in the charitable sector more frequently share it publicly.</p>
<p><strong>We are all familiar with portfolios where risk and return are balanced. Can the idea of optimizing risk and return be applied to charitable giving?</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important questions when considering a giving opportunity is the level of evidence that it will be effective. This can be thought of as tied to the level of risk. Some interventions have a lot of evidence, sometimes even being tested with similar scientific practices to what pharmaceutical companies are required to use to get new medicines approved. Other giving opportunities are not conducive to such hard evidence, such as with policy advocacy or research.</p>
<p>As with investing, the lowest risk approach isn’t necessarily the best, but taking risk is only desirable if it has the possibility for an outsized return — or impact.</p>
<p>Charitable giving doesn’t have a quantitative “efficient frontier” in the same sense as exists in investing, but risk and return are still important ideas.</p>
<p><strong>If I give without using this framework or a similar one, what are the risks?</strong></p>
<p>In the investing world, an adviser who is unconcerned about risk and return would undoubtedly be breaching fiduciary duties. With charitable giving, if you’re not focused on the evidence behind your approach and the potential outcomes, then you’re flying blind with respect to impact.</p>
<p><strong>The impact of a charity is fundamentally tricky to understand. Can you talk about that?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes donors only take a surface look at the evidence for impact, which can lead them in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>For example, many people who want to support education donate to college scholarships without thinking through how much the scholarships actually increase education versus facilitate people graduating with less debt.</p>
<p>Or worse, scholarships may enable universities to get away without controlling costs. It isn’t clear without a fairly deep understanding of the dynamics, but it is very possible that the impact of this type of donation is less than a donor might initially expect.</p>
<p>In contrast, giving to some causes might be greater than what one might assume on initial consideration. For example, research indicates that treating parasitic intestinal worms in developing world countries actually increases educational and economic outcomes in addition to health, possibly by the flow-through effects of improved nutrition.</p>
<p>This is an important reason why using intuition alone is often not a good strategy to maximize charitable impact.</p>
<p><strong>How does this compare to some of the key ways donors have historically evaluated charities?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of donors emphasize financial efficiency, such as evaluating charities based on the percentage they spend on overhead. The problem is that there can be very lean organizations that are not especially effective. In fact, “overhead” costs can often be critical for the success of a nonprofit, such as program evaluations and competitive salaries for quality staff.</p>
<p>To create an analogy to the investing world, don’t you want the companies you invest in to spend money on marketing, R&amp;D, and technology? Similarly, a certain level of overhead is critical for charities.</p>
<p>Of course, donors can rest assured that a wasteful organization is unlikely to have a high impact by any legitimate measure. I think the nonprofit community as a whole now recognizes that it is better to evaluate the program impact of a charity. This is a more difficult task than computing a few ratios from a charity’s IRS filings, but well worth the added effort.</p>
<p><strong>Many advisers shy away from talking about charitable giving with their clients because they view it as too complex or not their specialty. Is there something that simplifies the research process and gives donors access to a broadly diversified, rigorously constructed basket of charities?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. There are several charity evaluators that do very robust research and share their results publicly. The really good ones only give their top ratings to a handful of the most deserving charities.</p>
<p>The group I work with, <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a>, aggregates research from several reliable sources to provide a broader list of recommendations than any one source individually. Importantly, we try hard to present the information in a way that is easy to digest for both financial advisers and donors.</p>
