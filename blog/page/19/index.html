<p>I bet you’ve been thinking about China more often than usual over the past few months.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>Why focus there? The Shanghai Composite sits right around 3,000 today, which is quite a long way down from the 5,000 it was at three quarters ago. There are big questions to ponder. Think like a Chinese policymaker. With a slowing domestic economy and significant evidence of capital flight, do you focus on a <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/03/22/chinas-dilemma-stabilize-monetary-policy-or-the-renminbi/">stable currency or a stable monetary policy</a>?</p>
<p>That question has, to put it mildly, some implications for the investment community.</p>
<p>It’s also helpful to note that, on at least one quantitative basis, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/03/08/robert-engle-on-systemic-risk-in-china-and-around-the-world/">systemic risk in China is the highest of any country in the world</a>. That’s not much of a surprise to those who are paying attention. More than half of the <em><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/14/how-poorly-will-chinas-economy-perform-in-2016/">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/14/how-poorly-will-chinas-economy-perform-in-2016/">who we polled</a> think that the economy will turn in less than 6% growth this year.</p>
<p>Investors looking for additional context have been studying the most recent <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/02/03/what-makes-chinas-corporate-bond-market-different/">report to the National People’s Congress (NPC)</a>, but it is also helpful to examine the fundamental differences that China has in terms of market structure. Some things do not look at all like they do elsewhere. For instance, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/02/03/what-makes-chinas-corporate-bond-market-different/">credit analysis requires an investor to be, to some degree, an analyst of state policy</a>.</p>
<p>I was eager to get some perspective on what’s happening and what to expect, so I enlisted the help of Gordon Chang, a <a href="http://www.gordonchang.com/article.htm">peripatetic and knowledgeable observer of the region</a> and a <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/07/02/is-china-coming-off-the-rails/">return guest to the <em>Enterprising Investor</em></a>. Chang is the author of <a href="http://www.gordonchang.com/books.htm">two books</a> and also writes for <em><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/#7116599136a6">Forbes</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/users/gordon-g-chang">World Affairs</a></em>.</p>
<p>The format of what follows is relatively simple: The charts and questions come from me, and the answers come from him. Let’s jump in.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese Equity Markets Have Grown Meaningfully in Market Capitalization</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Markets.png"><img alt="Chinese Equity Markets have Grown Meaningfully" src="images/Markets.png?resize=640%2C301"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Enterprising Investor: Looking just at the growth of China’s market capitalization, it’s an impressive track record. How would the Communist Party of China like us to see this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gordon Chang:</strong> They’d like you to look at the market as really being modern. Really as a rival to New York, and in some ways it is. For instance, before the collapse of the Chinese stock market last year, the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-08/china-just-killed-the-world-s-biggest-stock-index-futures-market">Chinese stock index futures market was the largest in the world</a>. The volume there is very, very big.</p>
<p>The problem is that although you have a lot of money sloshing around China, those markets are not modern. We saw that as the Communist Party tried to rescue stock prices beginning the first week of July. They directly intervened. They criminalized a lot of forms of trading. They prevented the institutions from selling. They directly bought up stock through the so-called “<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/27/chinas-national-team-stock-market-ownership.html">National Team</a>.”</p>
<p>Despite the fact that these stock markets are now about 25 years old, they really haven’t reformed very much. There’s been relatively little progress because the government right now is just dominating the markets. China no longer has functioning equity markets.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>As GDP Growth Slows</strong>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/GDP.png"><img alt="But GDP Growth is Slowing" src="images/GDP.png?resize=640%2C321"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>We’ve all been told not to trust China’s GDP figures. Can you take us inside the statistics a little bit?</strong></p>
<p>The National Bureau of Statistics reported 6.9% growth for 2015, but very few people now actually believe that. There’s a consensus forming around 4.0%. For instance, you have the Conference Board reporting 3.7% growth for last year.</p>
<p>Capital Economics in London is saying 4.3%. Although, you can make a case for 1% or 2%, especially when you look at electricity consumption, which is still by far the most reliable indicator of Chinese economic activity, and when you look at price data. For instance, for last year, when they were reporting 6.9% real, they were also reporting 6.4% nominal.</p>
<p>China’s officially in deflationary territory. Q4 was really ugly, because Q4, nominal was 5.8% and real was 6.8%. This is a situation going downward. It doesn’t really matter what China’s growth rate is, whether it’s 6.9% or 1%. The point right now is that Chinese leaders cannot change the downward trajectory. China’s growth has been slowing fast. It’s going to continue to do that.</p>
<p>Eventually, it’s going to go into contraction, and that’s a problem because China has accumulated all this debt in order to create growth. In some way, it’s got to pay this debt back. In one way or another, it’s got to retire these obligations. This means that China’s headed towards a debt crisis.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>While Debt Grows Meaningfully</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Govt-debt.png"><img alt="While Debt Grows Meaningfully" src="images/Govt-debt.png?resize=640%2C293"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>It sounds great, 50% year-on-year growth, until you realize we’re measuring debt. And again, that’s just as reported by the government, which we’re taught to suspect fudges numbers from time to time. What could the true number be?</strong></p>
<p>Their debt, we don’t really know what it is. For instance, McKinsey Global Institute said, in the middle of 2014, that it was 282% debt to GDP. Soros, in Davos in January, said 350%. Some people are talking 400%, which I think is actually closer to the mark.</p>
<p>This is not a good story. There’s an enormous amount of debt out there. A lot has been stuffed away in corners. We don’t have a really good view of what it is. When you combine that with stalling growth, it means that there’s got to be an adjustment, and that adjustment’s probably going to look like 1929.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Are Domestic Borrowers Preparing for a Devaluation?</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/fx-loans.png"><img alt="fx Are Borrowers Getting Ready For a Devaluation" src="images/fx-loans.png?resize=640%2C302"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>It seems like Chinese borrowers are maybe anticipating a currency move. If they were caught offsides with renminbi revenues and dollar debts, that would be really bad. Is that what’s going on here?</strong></p>
<p>Last year, there was $1 trillion of net capital outflow, according to Bloomberg. Other people say a little bit less. A large part of that net capital outflow were Chinese borrowers switching out of US dollar debt into renminbi debt, because they are concerned about the exposure. They don’t want to get caught on the wrong side of a declining renminbi, which is actually happening right now.</p>
<p>Of course, the central bank is trying to support it, but eventually they’re going to have to relent. They will have to capitulate. When they capitulate, it’s going to probably be at the last moment, because they’re going to hold on for as long as they can do so. When they can no longer do so, we’re going to see a run out of this currency.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Trading Volumes and Margin Balances Have Dropped Appreciably</strong>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Trading-volume.png"><img alt="Something Changed Recently" src="images/Trading-volume.png?resize=640%2C269"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What’s going on with the plummeting volume and margin balances?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you’ve got to remember that one thing that’s happened since the first week of July, and that is the central government, through various state entities — the so‑called National Team — has been buying up stock. When the National Team buys out stock, it doesn’t trade them, so you’re going to have declining volume.</p>
<p>Also, this is a partial re-nationalization of state enterprises, so this is bad on two counts. That’s why you have volume declining. One thing that’s fascinating: Bloomberg reported that volume of the stock index futures market — which was the world’s largest prior to the mid‑June collapse — volume in the July-August-September time frame declined 99%.</p>
<p>This is an indication of how tough the central government has been, how determined it’s been to support stock prices. They’re going to do everything they possibly can to prevent the market values from tanking, but when they do that, they’re killing volume, and China no longer has a functioning stock market right now. It just doesn’t. It’s the government playing.</p>
<p>What we see in terms of changes in the Shanghai Composite, when they go up, it’s mostly the government. When they go down, it’s when the government isn’t looking.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Zooming Out, You Wonder: What Currency Volatility?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/rmb.png"><img alt="It Cant Just Be the Currency" src="images/rmb.png?resize=640%2C278"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The renminbi is this big specter that looms over any thought an investor might have regarding China. Recent currency moves have not been that big, if you look at them on a long time horizon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There has been talk about further devaluation, but what range of values are we really talking about here?</strong></p>
<p>The central bank has said that they’re not going to have a big one-time devaluation, which might make sense. They will continue to support it until they no longer have dollars and foreign currency to do so, which means that when it adjusts, it’s going to adjust sharp. It’s going to be sudden, and there’s no bottom to this market.</p>
<p>They will hold on until the very last moment. They can prevent large downward movements to the renminbi, but they really cannot, I think, do this for that much longer. There’s too much money coming out of the country.</p>
<p>One of the things that’s even worse: There was, in February, a much smaller decline in the foreign exchange reserves compared to January, when it was $99.5 billion. It declined to under $30, about $28 billion in February. That’s because basically no one’s allowed to remit money out of the country. Or, if they do so, it’s under very tight circumstances.</p>
<p>China’s essentially re-imposed very strict capital controls. A lot of these controls are off the books, so they’re not official. This works for a little while, but the problem is: Who’s going to put their money into a country when they may not be able to get it out?</p>
<p>The issue for China is going to be inward flows. Eventually those inward flows will stop, because of what they’re doing to prevent the outward flows.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Forex Reserves Seem to Have Been Spent to Support the Currency</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Forex-reserves.png"><img alt="ForEx Reserves are Being Spent to Support It" src="images/Forex-reserves.png?resize=640%2C296"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>But Are They Just Replacing Outward Capital Flows?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Capital-Flows.png"><img alt="Seemingly Directly Replacing Outward Capital Flows" src="images/Capital-Flows.png?resize=640%2C289"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>The reported declines in foreign exchange reserves I think have been minimized. They give us a number. We can back check it, but it’s hard to do that.</p>
<p>Also, the one thing they’ve been doing is they’ve been engaging in forward transactions to hide the decline in the foreign reserves. They’re going with these derivatives. This is what Brazil did in 2013. It never ends well. Yes, China has a lot of firepower, but it’s declining fast.</p>
<p>Also, some of the funds in the reserves may not be liquid, so, therefore, they may not be available for defense of the currency. There’s a big black box there, and the global financial community just relies on the numbers that China has been giving us. I don’t know if we can actually do that.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Chaos Is Becoming Consensus</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/consensus.png"><img alt="Chaos is Becoming The Consensus" src="images/consensus.png?resize=640%2C250"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>This is definitely news. We were joking at the beginning of this. We titled our last conversation, “Is China Going Off the Rails?” At the time, that was not a question many were asking.</strong> <strong>Recently <em>The New York Times</em> ran a headline saying the answer was yes: “A New Economic Era for China as They Go Off the Rails.” Are enough people talking enough about this? Are too many?</strong></p>
<p>I think that the global financial community understands that there are real problems in China, and they didn’t understand this, let’s say, eight or nine months ago.</p>
<p>For instance, you go back to August of 2015. You have relatively unimportant news coming out of the Chinese manufacturing sector causing big drops in equity markets in Asia, Europe, and the United States. For instance, we had six days in August when we lost $2.1 trillion in value because of inconsequential things happening in China.</p>
<p>Now, when you have bad news out of China, it doesn’t necessarily affect global markets. I think we’re becoming inured to that. Also, I think the global financial community, although it understands there are problems there, I don’t think they understand the dimension of the problems.</p>
<p>They see the Chinese government sort of rescuing things, but they don’t really look behind how that’s occurring and the sustainability of Beijing’s moves. Beijing’s moves: They can do this for a year or two, but the problem is that as they prevent the adjustment, the underlying imbalances are becoming bigger.</p>
<p>As the underlying imbalances become bigger, the inevitable adjustment has to be severe. Chinese leaders are continuing to do this stuff until they no longer have the ability to do that. When they no longer have the ability to do it, their economy will go into free fall. I don’t think the global financial community understands that.</p>

<p><strong>China Seems to Be Moving from One Sort of Outlier to Another</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/age-dependency.png"><img alt="Is This a Transition from One Sort of Outlier to Another" src="images/age-dependency.png?resize=640%2C341"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How much of this is just demographics?</strong>
**
At the moment, they have a massive working-age population supporting a relatively small number of retirees, but World Bank estimates have us right at the inflection point where it heads the other way. By 2050, China will have more retirees than the rest of the world and perhaps a less dynamic population and economy, by extension.**</p>
<p>**A view that’s forming is that really this is the beginning of the end for them. Is it the case that there are a couple of reforms that they can enact, burn off some bad debt, and get back to business, or are we witnessing a structural decline?
**
There are structural economic reforms that if they were implemented could save China, but the problem is that those reforms are not possible within the context of the political system that China’s president, Xi Jinping, will not change. The answer is that we’re not going to see the reforms that are necessary.</p>
<p>Indeed, at Premier Li Keqiang’s work report at the ongoing National People’s Congress meeting, it’s clear that they’re prioritizing growth over reform. They’ve basically given up on reform. Yes, they talk about it, but they’re not implementing it.</p>
<p>That means that what we’re seeing is essentially a long, slow decline. Without reform, they aren’t going to be able to make the changes that are absolutely necessary. There’s just no political will to do that.</p>
<p>In fact, if we look at the changes in the economy since Xi Jinping became China’s general party secretary in November 2012, he’s taken China backwards. He’s recombining already large-state enterprises back into monopolies.</p>
<p>We’re seeing the partial re-nationalization of the Chinese economy as more and more state ownership of state enterprises. More state money going to favored market participants. Foreign companies are losing market share, because they’re being attacked by the state.</p>
<p>These are all things that are regressive, so Deng Xiaoping’s policy of reform and opening up is over. We’re going back to a Maoist-inspired economy. That may sound a little harsh, but indeed what Xi Jinping is doing is very reminiscent of what we saw in the 1950s. This is a bad story for China.</p>
<p>Yes, they can stave off problems while they have more and more state control, but eventually this whole thing just fails, as it did before.</p>
<p>**You say the recipe is similar to Mao’s in terms of centralizing control. What are some other major points of concordance between what Xi Jinping has been doing and the 1950s period in China?
**</p>
<p>When we look at it, I think the most telling thing is the re-creation of state monopolies, which is absolutely the wrong way to go. China created growth in the 1990s when they went the other way, when they were breaking up state monopolies, allowing state enterprises to compete with each other.</p>
<p>Now, we’re about a year and a half, two years into a reversal process. That means there’s more and more of these recombinations. That means less and less competition. That can’t be good for the competitiveness of these enterprises except for competitiveness at home.</p>
<p>Of course, the bigger they get with no competitors, yes, they will be able to maximize profits. Only in China, though. Around the world, they’re going to get beaten, because they are losing those qualities of competitiveness that are absolutely necessary to compete in global markets.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Growth in Energy Consumption Has Stalled</strong>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Electricity-consumption.png"><img alt="Slowing Growth in Electricity Usage" src="images/Electricity-consumption.png?resize=640%2C291"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Analysts love to look at electricity usage in China, under a theory that you can’t really trust GDP that much.</strong></p>
<p>For 2015, electricity consumption increased by 0.5%. Generally speaking, GDP growth has been about 85% of the growth of electricity. We’re talking a pretty low GDP number.</p>
<p>Of course, electricity’s only one indicator, but there are others that corroborate, essentially, a no‑growth environment. If we go back to the last downturn at the end of the 1990s, a lot of people were saying electricity was no longer so indicative. Afterwards, after that downturn passed, people went back and realized electricity was indeed still the best indicator.</p>
<p>Now, people are saying there’s a move away from manufacturing to services, so therefore electricity is not as important as it once was. There may be a little bit of truth in that, but nonetheless, when you look at all the range of indicators that we have, electricity, I believe, is still number one.</p>
<p>We’re seeing so many other signs of minimal growth that I think electricity still is telling us what the Chinese economy is doing.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>And Rail Volume Has Fallen</strong>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Rail-volume.png"><img alt="And Theres Less Stuff Moving Around" src="images/Rail-volume.png?resize=640%2C295"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How relevant is rail freight volume?</strong></p>
<p>Rail freight was one of the three indicators that Premier Li Keqiang mentioned as the things that he looked at when he was a provincial party secretary. This is going back to 2007, when he was talking to the American ambassador.</p>
<p>This was in a WikiLeaks cable. The three things he mentioned were electricity consumption, rail freight volume, and bank lending. Rail freight volume is something we can measure. It’s something that is easy to verify, and we see it going down.</p>
<p>People say, “Well, more stuff is being moved by truck.” Maybe, but nonetheless, the decline in rail freight volume is especially troubling because it is so large, these percentage decreases. I think that, essentially, we’re looking, again, at another factor showing basically the contraction of the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>I think the manufacturing sector is contracting. It did last year, 2% or 3%, maybe a little bit more. There may be an increase in services, but not nearly enough to make up for the decline in manufacturing, especially because the central government devastated the financial services industry beginning in the middle of July, when they tried to rescue stock prices.</p>
<p>A lot of things are going in the wrong direction right now. Not everything, but a lot of them.</p>
<p><strong>We’ll get to the stuff that’s going in the right direction in a little bit.</strong></p>
<p>That’s a one‑minute discussion.</p>
<p><strong>It seemed a bit that way when I started digging through the data. What is going in the right direction?</strong></p>
<p>There are more retail sales, certainly not as much as the central government statistics indicate. The problem with the increase in consumption, I think, is that it’s basically a derivative of growth elsewhere, especially growth of investment.</p>
<p>Investment growth is completely unsustainable. It’s anti‑reform. When investment growth starts to choke even more than it is now, I think it’s going to take consumption with it. What we’re seeing from consumer products companies is some growth, but not very much.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to report, “Oh, say, well, the growth of volume over Alibaba’s platforms and JD.com, online retailers,” but they’re really taking away sales from bricks and mortar. When you start to look at companies that sell across both platforms, online and offline, there really is unimpressive growth or even some contraction in the earnings of these companies related to China.</p>
<p>There’s some positive story there, but it’s not enough to counteract the collapse of manufacturing.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The Export Picture Is Grim</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Exports.png"><img alt="A Grim Export Picture" src="images/Exports.png?resize=640%2C327"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Should we be taking the recent export numbers as an accurate signal?</strong></p>
<p>There might be a little bit of distortion related to Chinese New Year, but when you combine January and February numbers for both imports and exports, they’re both down deep in the double digits. That eliminates entirely the New Year effect.</p>
<p>Trade is just disastrous. You notice that Premier Li Keqiang, in his work report, didn’t have a target for trade this year. That’s the first time, I think, ever. For the last four years, they have not met their target.</p>
<p>Last year, their target was 6% growth in exports and imports combined. It actually came out down 8%. They missed by 14 percentage points. It’s not getting any better, as we saw from January and February.</p>
<p>This is a real indication of problems in the Chinese economy. The import number, I think, is the more important one because that reflects manufacturing demand, and it also reflects consumer demand. You have some pretty atrocious‑looking numbers coming out of imports and exports.</p>
<p>Certainly, just looking at this chart, even if you take the 12‑month average, it’s negative. There’s a very senior person on Bloomberg saying, “Oh, no, it’s not that bad. It’s only down 4% on average all year,” which seems like a spurious argument.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Aluminum Consumption Fell Sharply</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/aluminum-.png"><img alt="A Sharp Drop in Aluminum Consumption" src="images/aluminum-.png?resize=640%2C294"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Is there anything in particular to be made about of the drop-off in aluminum consumption?</strong></p>
<p>That’s a reflection of contraction of manufacturing. You’re going to see that in steel and coal statistics as well. That’s pretty much across the board in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>It Appears China Is in an Industrial Recession</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Recession.png"><img alt="Industrial Recession" src="images/Recession.png?resize=640%2C319"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The satellite index is the most negative and, presumably, the most reliable.</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to hide from space. The satellite indices have been the most negative, but even traditional ones, the one done by Markit, the London‑based research firm, it’s just been continually negative in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Even their services indices, which are still above water, they’re heading towards the contraction point. This is an economy which is slowly grinding to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>If they devalue their currency, presumably it makes their exports more competitive?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but they can’t do that. The reason is they will trigger even worse capital outflow. They’re basically prevented from doing that. Donald Trump says, “Well, they’re manipulating their currency to help their exporters.”</p>
<p>Yes, they are manipulating their currency, but they’re keeping it at an artificially high value. They have to do that to prevent capital outflow. It’s basically our exporters are being helped by China’s currency manipulation now, which is a reversal, of course.</p>
<p>Traditionally, China kept its currency below its market value in order to help exporters. Now, it’s keeping it above market value.</p>

<p><strong>Industrial Profits Aren’t Growing</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Chinese-industrial-companies.png"><img alt="Long-Lived Profit Recession" src="images/Chinese-industrial-companies.png?resize=640%2C315"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How does the government talk about the stagnation in industrial profits?</strong></p>
<p>They don’t. I think earnings, as reported out of Chinese companies can be a little bit not as reliable because of the nature of the accounting profession and other things. Nonetheless, it’s more reliable than what comes out of the Bureau of National Statistics because some of those numbers are completely made up.</p>
<p>It’s just fantasy land. At least with the accountants, they’ve got to at least have some responsibilities to the market. Therefore, it does give us a better window into what’s actually happening.</p>
<p>**This is true at the revenue level as well. If you look at the Shanghai Composite, revenues are not growing. This is also true of indices in the States. In many ways, it’s the elephant in the room for global equity markets. Is there a way out of this?
**
I don’t think there is a way out of it. I think that they’re heading to that adjustment as the Chinese economy continues to slow. Especially when it gets to that contraction point, where it’s very close already, then I think we’re going to see a lot of things happen very quickly.</p>
<p>They’re just hanging on right now, and they’re able to do that. They can slow the inevitable, but they can’t prevent it because they have not been able to repeal the laws of economics. That’s why they’ve now got this fight with Moody’s over their ratings.</p>
<p>That just shows, Moody’s said, “Look, you can’t have the impossible trinity.” China then gets outraged that Moody’s would ever say that. What China’s trying to do is say, “Well, oh, the laws of economics do not apply to China.” They do apply. They apply differently because of the degree of state control, which is becoming more and more state control, but nonetheless, they cannot prevent the inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) Are Booming</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.23.52-AM.png"><img alt="Booming NPLs" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.23.52-AM.png?resize=640%2C307"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Does this headline increase in non-performing (NPLs) capture the reality?</strong></p>
<p>The numbers have gone up, but the reported number is not nearly as high as they, in effect, are, because people are not applying international standards.</p>
<p>A lot of this stuff is being rolled over, and so, therefore, it’s being counted as good. It’s only good because banks have been ordered not to call in loans. This means we’ve seen a lot of credit growth, but we haven’t seen growth in the economy, which you would expect.</p>
<p>As interest builds up, you have to lend more and more just to roll over what exists. That’s what occurring now. If you were to actually apply international standards to the loan books of these banks, we’d be seeing NPL ratios of 20%–30%, easy.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Banking Assets Are Ballooning</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.24.11-AM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-22 at 112411 AM" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.24.11-AM.png?resize=640%2C282"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>We’ve got overall banking assets that have slowed to “just” 40% growth year on year.</strong></p>
<p>It’s crazy. It’s absolutely crazy. What they’re doing is they’re just throwing a lot of money. People say, “Well, look, they’ve got a relatively high reserve requirement ratio for the banks, and they’ve got relatively high interest rates.”</p>
<p>They say, “Therefore, they have a lot of ammunition.” No, they don’t, because you can throw more money into this economy, and it isn’t going to do any good because there’s a fundamental lack of demand for money.</p>
<p>Yes, the government will build infrastructure, and yes, technically that does create gross domestic product, but it’s only government directed. Private businesses just don’t have a need for money, unless it’s connected to some government infrastructure or other government program.</p>
<p>That means, essentially, that it isn’t going to work. You throw more money in this economy, you just have more money. You don’t have more growth.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a sad state in the world, when you think about it, if people are sitting around going, “Oh, you know, I don’t need more money.” That says a lot.</strong></p>
<p>That says a lot. China’s not the only country with that problem, but their problem is so much greater than our problem here in the States, for instance.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Did a Memo Go Out?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.25.06-AM.png"><img alt="Did a Memo Go Out" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.25.06-AM.png?resize=640%2C296"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The all‑system financing aggregate hit an all‑time high, after having been trending downward. Is this just evidence that the government is opening a spigot somewhere?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. They’ve done this before, and they say they’re not going to do it again, because Premier Wen Jiabao, who authorized the stimulus program in November 2008, he put too much money into the economy.</p>
<p>He created about as much credit in five years as the entire US banking system, even though in November 2008 the Chinese economy was less than a third the size of America’s. Everyone said, “Well, look, that’s not what we should be doing.”</p>
<p>They say, “Oh, no, no, no, no, we’ll never do that,” but of course, that’s exactly what they’re doing. A memo did go out. Everyone was told to lend, and this is what we got. We got a lot of money supply.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Real Estate: Supply Crunch?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.25.27-AM.png"><img alt="A Supply Crunch in Real Estate" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.25.27-AM.png?resize=640%2C318"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>If you look at the leading indicators of inventory, like land purchased and the actual amount of real estate that’s under construction, you see it trending down. Meanwhile, you see a 50% year-on-year increase in the price of one square meter in a Tier 1 city.</strong></p>
<p>Tier 1 cities, there is still demand for real estate. There’s no question about that. When you start going to Tier 3 cities, there’s just enormous amount of supply, and there’s very little demand, so it’s a bifurcated market.</p>
<p>If you’re in Beijing and Shanghai, you have a relatively healthy real estate market, and prices are still going up. You start to get out of China’s major cities, and there are real problems. What they did to create growth in the past was just to build, build, and build, and now they don’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Even in places like Guangdong Province, which is a relatively prosperous, modern province, you now have calls for state enterprises to buy apartments, because that’s the only way they can do this to solve their problem, use one state entity to bail out another.</p>
<p>There’s a real problem once you get out of Beijing, and Shanghai, and Guangzhou.</p>
<p><strong>Where I live in Brooklyn, a million bucks buys you a fixer‑upper, but travel 500 miles in any direction and you can have almost whatever you want for that price. Is that the analogy?</strong></p>
<p>That’s the same thing, yeah.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>A Retail-Driven Bubble?</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.00-AM.png"><img alt="A Retail-Driven Bubble" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.00-AM.png?resize=640%2C325"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>I want to ask you about retail investors and the domestic stock market. One of the things you notice when you look into it is there’s this incredible boom in the number of trading accounts that were opened in the mainland. Then, the government discontinued the statistics on it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About two or three months after they discontinued the statistics, the Shanghai Composite hit its recent high. Did we see recent inflows of retail investors who were basically gamblers? Is that what’s going on?</strong></p>
<p>There was a lot of that, especially because when you start to go back to September 2014 or so. Keqiang’s policy was to talk up the stock market. You did have a lot of retail investors start to go into it, especially when prices started to move up. That created momentum.</p>
<p>That’s why you have a sharp increase in the number of retail accounts in the first part of 2015. Then, of course, June occurs. You have the beginnings of real problems. The markets start to turn down. Then you have retail investors start to leave, because they’ve been burned, lost their money.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of it was retail driven, but also, there’s Chinese institutional money in there. Even some foreign money’s starting to flood in when they saw the markets turn up. There’s a lot of stuff going in, but the real sensitive stuff was the Chinese retail investors. When they get burned, that becomes a social stability issue.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Why Do Vehicle Sales Keep Growing?</strong>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.29-AM.png"><img alt="Why Are Vehicles Still Selling So Well" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.29-AM.png?resize=640%2C280"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Vehicle sales seem to be a bright point though.</strong></p>
<p>Vehicle sales have done really well. Vehicle sales started to tail off last summer, but they’ve recovered. Right now, they’re starting to turn down again. This has been a real pillar industry, and we have seen state enterprises go out and buy vehicles in the hundreds. They then store them. That’s called lot rot. There’s been a certain amount of that.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’s no question that vehicle sales have held up well. Either you see the wealthy in Tier 1 cities buying cars at a pretty healthy clip. I don’t think that’s going to last, but, nonetheless, it is one of the bright spots.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>So Bad It’s Good?</strong>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.48-AM.png"><img alt="So Bad Its Good" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.48-AM.png?resize=640%2C334"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>There’s some sense that we’re getting totally used to the negative economic surprises that are coming out. Our expectations are low. Maybe the news is so bad it’s good on China. I wonder how you’d react to that statement.</strong></p>
<p>Apart from what we saw in August and September last year when it was, as I mentioned, unimportant news really triggered very big falls in equity markets around the world. Now, I think people are not focused on China. They’re focused on problems closer to home.</p>
<p>I think that’s what’s really driving markets right now much more so than that. When China starts to have real troubles, then again, we’re going to see the same phenomena that we saw last August and September. Again, I don’t think that bad China news has really been discounted.</p>
<p>A lot of people still say low sixes for growth. People are saying four, which the consensus is now at. If it really is closer to one or two, then clearly they haven’t discounted all the bad news. When it gets to zero and negative one, watch out.</p>
<p><strong>Presumably there’s even a threat to the government’s ability to stay in power at that point.</strong></p>
<p>People talk about that right now. I was on a panel for a bank with Asian connections in Boston [several] weeks ago. Afterwards, a young Chinese woman came up to my wife, and she’s the type who would come to the United States, get an education, work five years, and then go back to China for their career.</p>
<p>She told my wife, “I’m not going back. None of my friends are going back. My friends in China are saying this government might not last.” Yeah, there’s a lot of talk about that right now among Chinese themselves. There is a real issue about where this is going to go.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Can the Government Keep Growing Revenues?</strong>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.27.08-AM.png"><img alt="Can The Government Keep Growing Revenues" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.27.08-AM.png?resize=640%2C295"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>One potentially reassuring thing is that the government has done a decent job at actually growing its revenues, although it’s grown debt much faster.</strong></p>
<p>Spending is growing much faster than revenue growth.</p>
<p>Yes, there was revenue growth in 2015, something on the order of, I forget exactly, like 7% or 8%. Fiscal spending last year, according to the government itself, was up 15.8%. There’s a pretty big gap there, and those are official numbers. Who knows what the real numbers are.</p>
<p>We know that a lot of central government spending is not disclosed in the central government’s budget. Military, for instance. A lot of military expenditures are not there.</p>
<p>There have been fantastic increases in fiscal spending. Last October, fiscal spending year on year up 36.1%. November it was up 15.9%. They didn’t disclose December, and I don’t blame them, probably because it was pretty bad. This is an out of control spending government.</p>
<p>While it’s good for them that they’ve got some revenues and they’re able to drive that line higher, they’re not able to drive it as fast as spending.</p>
<p>You’ve got to remember that in the work reports that we’ve been seeing at the National People’s Congress meeting, they’re increasing their deficit from 2.4% of GDP, which is what they claimed for 2015, to 3% this year.</p>
<p>Now, 3% is a psychological line, not just for the Chinese but for others. China is probably going to bust through 3% in reality, because they don’t disclose all their spending. Who knows what they’re going to be next year. This is not going in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>I realize I haven’t asked you at all about security. China’s neighbor and a critical part of the global security question is North Korea, who’s been testing their nuclear weapons . . .</strong></p>
<p>And long‑range missiles.</p>
<p><strong>. . . and threatening to use them preemptively. How should we be contextualizing that? Will China be an effective partner in working with the North, and what really can be done there?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think so, for a lot of reasons. First of all, the China and North Korea relation has eroded, especially after the execution of Jang Sung‑taek in December 2013, because Jang handled relations with Beijing.</p>
<p>The real problem is you’ve got a government in North Korea, a regime, where you have Kim Jung Un, the ruler, feuding with the military, which is still the most important institution in North Korean society. It’s unstable, and I don’t think the Chinese or anybody else can actually have much influence where you have intense infighting.</p>
<p>Plus, also, you’ve got intense infighting in Beijing. Not as bad as it looks like in Pyongyang, but, nonetheless, this is an unstable situation as well. You’ve got two governments right now that are starting to splinter, and that means that north Asia is exceedingly dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>That’s not great news, but thank you so much, Gordon, for sharing your view and for spending time with us. I’m sure Enterprising Investor readers are quite pleased to have your perspective, as well.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-troll-economy-in-seven-charts"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/03/04/the-troll-economy-in-seven-charts/">The Troll Economy in Seven Charts</a></h2>
<p>_I wrote this essay for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor. It includes one of the few mixtapes on earth that qualifies for continuing education credits.
_</p>
<p>By troll economy, I mean that of the United States of America, of course.</p>
<p>Anybody who doesn’t think the United States is a special place has never tried <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-25-best-barbecue-restaurants-in-america-2015-7">real barbecue</a> (BBQ). But BBQ’s just the beginning. Let’s start with geopolitics. As the excellent book <em><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mr-peter-zeihan/the-accidental-superpower/9781478983118/">The Accidental Superpower</a></em> notes, most Americans have no grasp of the bounty they are blessed with. Author <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/peter-zeihan/">Peter Zeihan</a>, who will be speaking at the <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/">69th CFA Institute Annual Conference</a> in May, points out that the United States just happens to have the world’s best piece of arable land — the American Midwest — located conveniently amid the world’s largest navigable network of waterways.</p>
<p>If you forget every other nice thing you know about the United States but remember that, you still walk away thinking the country is disproportionately blessed by good fortune. Add to that some simple observations about US ports — the Chesapeake Bay alone “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fareed-zakaria-americas-prospects-are-promising-indeed/2014/11/20/eb91209a-70f3-11e4-ad12-3734c461eab6_story.html">boasts longer stretches of prime port property than the entire continental coast of Asia from Vladivostok to Lahore</a>” — and you can’t help but feel pretty positive about the country’s long-term competitiveness.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The U.S. has added jobs for 65 straight months, the longest streak on record.<a href="https://t.co/whRLn9enXB">https://t.co/whRLn9enXB</a> <a href="https://t.co/VsI8jRkDUc">pic.twitter.com/VsI8jRkDUc</a></p>— Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) <a href="https://twitter.com/bencasselman/status/705822105145905152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>And that competitiveness has come again to troll those who have forecast the imminent death of US economic expansion, fueled as it may be by monetary voodoo and financial engineering. New data released on Friday add just another piece of color to a picture that is far from bleak.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Unemployment-to-Population Ratio Fell Two-Tenths of a Percent on Strong Household Survey Hiring: <a href="https://t.co/GyKHrQ6yEJ">pic.twitter.com/GyKHrQ6yEJ</a></p>— Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) <a href="https://twitter.com/M_McDonough/status/705752568278999041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>It’s also an objective reality that the workers who have been on the sidelines are re-entering the labor force, at least to some degree.</p>
<p>And though wages haven’t grown yet, there’s ample reason to believe they should (and will).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"Great quarter guys"<a href="https://t.co/9EFdPkkdrL">https://t.co/9EFdPkkdrL</a> <a href="https://t.co/HNsitX3NEN">pic.twitter.com/HNsitX3NEN</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/703306637897928705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>But the economy is not the market, and this rosy picture hasn’t (yet) translated into what matters most for investors: growth. We can talk about the gap between expectations and performance — and there are some positive stories there — but the fact remains that revenues are not growing in aggregate.</p>
<p>Take a look at the last big piece I did — <a href="http://srvo.org/34-charts-this-time-is-different">34 Charts: This Time is Different</a> — to get some more color there.</p>
<p>But let’s all close our eyes for a minute and think about what it might mean to live in a world where Americans who want jobs have them and their wages start growing.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If it quacks like a duck.... <a href="https://t.co/tnCTkJXjBN">pic.twitter.com/tnCTkJXjBN</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/705850238611931144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>And the word gets out about this thing called inflation. At just such a time, it would be convenient to remember a thing called <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PhillipsCurve.html">the Phillips Curve</a>, which suggests that wage inflation will accelerate as unemployment continues to fall.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Markets still barely pricing in one more <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fed</a> rate hike this year. <a href="https://t.co/CL8e84fugU">pic.twitter.com/CL8e84fugU</a></p>— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href="https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/705704070019940356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>In just such a circumstance, it’s likely that current projections about the path of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve will be seen as impossibly dovish, unless of course the Fed chooses to ignore its long-time targets: 5% unemployment and 2% inflation.</p>
<p>Why might it do that? Perhaps it <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/03/why-the-federal-reserve-should-be-the-worlds-central-bank">will focus on the still-tepid global economy</a>. Vice chair Stanley Fischer <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20150526a.htm">insists the Fed must look beyond its borders but also remember that it is not the world’s central bank</a>.</p>
<p>In either circumstance, America could frustrate the rest of the globe. A Fed that’s forced towards hawkishness as domestic job gains and inflation continue to materialize would be a headwind to the rest of the world unless it follows suit.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Germany?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Germany</a> beats the U.S. on real <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GDP</a> per Capita. <a href="https://t.co/cf1tRsQKVh">pic.twitter.com/cf1tRsQKVh</a></p>— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href="https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/705845362716762112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>That might happen! But we’re still a long way from any sort of conclusive directional proof. It’s also hard to imagine a Fed that ignores rapidly increasing inflation and a tightening labor market in deference to global growth risks for very long. Especially if you take a moment to consider the current domestic political climate.</p>
<p>In any case, <a href="http://fat-pitch.blogspot.com/2016/03/march-macro-update-recession-risk.html?spref=tw">an imminent recession does not seem to be in the cards for the United States</a>. No reason not to stay vigilant — these things revert quickly — but the immediate risks are elsewhere. What if the troll economy forces rates upward unexpectedly and well before the rest of the world is ready? That’s the risk I’d ponder as you head off for the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="34-charts-this-time-is-different"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/02/27/34-charts-this-time-is-different/">34 Charts: This Time is Different</a></h2>
<p><em>This was one of the more widely read pieces I ever wrote for the Enterprising Investor at CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>“This time is different” — I might include that in the title of everything I publish from now on.</p>
<p>I’ll never be wrong, which is an appealing proposition. A man can dream. And funny thing: A dream is the subject at hand.</p>
<p>In October, I asked whether the market could <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/10/26/15-charts-can-the-market-have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too/">have its cake and eat it too</a>. The hope was for persistent low interest rates and consistently appreciating securities.</p>
<p>Somebody seems to have remembered cake doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p>According to some, this buying opportunity is brought to you by the letter “C”: China, commodities, and the now questionably healthy consumer. Reaching towards risk feels sensible. It’s been nearly 10 years since it wasn’t.</p>
<p>But today, growth, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/14/weekend-reads-the-recurring-death-of-certainty/">like certainty</a>, is hard to come by. We hear the word “recession” again. There have been more <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=sell%20stocks&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5" title="Link: https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=sell%20stocks&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5">Google searches for the phrase “sell stocks”</a> this month than at any time since October 2008. And January is not over.</p>
<p>To some strategists, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rbs-the-chance-of-an-imminent-recession-is-75-2016-1">the writing</a> is on <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/albert-edwards-societe-generales-woodstock-for-bears-financial-crisis-prediction-2016-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T">the wall</a>. I wrote recently that anyone who says they know exactly what will happen is wrong, cheating, or both. I still think that. So before getting into what I see, I want to tell you what to do: your homework. Now is the time to <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/21/todays-market-is-when-you-distinguish-yourself-as-an-investor/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/21/todays-market-is-when-you-distinguish-yourself-as-an-investor/">distinguish yourself as an investor</a>. So as you read through everything below, remember: I’ll be disappointed if you wind up agreeing with everything I say.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"It was the fifteenth-straight year-over-year fall in revenues for IBM" <a href="https://t.co/uNkm0yBUPU">https://t.co/uNkm0yBUPU</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/adamsamson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adamsamson</a> <a href="https://t.co/0XTqAHkmSt">pic.twitter.com/0XTqAHkmSt</a></p>— Mamta Badkar (@mamtabadkar) <a href="https://twitter.com/mamtabadkar/status/689563756473483264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Fifteen straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines from a company that once set the world on fire. Things haven’t actually been that bad for IBM since they <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/tripping-through-ibms-astonishingly-insane-1937-corporate-songbook/">disbanded their corporate orchestra in 2001</a>.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=Linear&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1453323600000&amp;chddm=499698&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;cmpto=INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC&amp;cmptdms=0&amp;q=NYSE:IBM&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=0d2fVtCOKpL5eqfOj6AG">outperformed the NASDAQ</a> until revenue growth reversed and it transmogrified from a tech company into an object lesson.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that to be mean. Without question, IBM is still changing the world. <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/">They make incredible things</a>. But they are far from the company they used to be. In 2000, books published in the English language mentioned IBM roughly <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=IBM%2CIntel%2C+Cisco%2Cmicrosoft&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2CIBM%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CIntel%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CCisco%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmicrosoft%3B%2Cc0">twice as often as Intel, Cisco, and Microsoft combined</a>. Today, “IBM” is googled <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ibm%2C%20cisco%2C%20intel%2C%20microsoft&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5">less than any of them</a>.</p>
<p>Is it prudent to bank on a rebound? Think it over as you keep reading.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Equal Weighted <a href="https://t.co/saumOX5pJH">https://t.co/saumOX5pJH</a> <a href="https://t.co/iq7n7Kd1Am">pic.twitter.com/iq7n7Kd1Am</a></p>— zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/688053290580492289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Because IBM is not alone. Investors focused on the Shanghai Composite could be forgiven for the assumption that the bull market we’ve experienced has brought us to broad-based new highs. Consider the experience of a wide range of companies instead, and it’s transparently not so simple.</p>
<p>Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (FANG) are the poster children for an era in which <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/in-silicon-valley-now-its-almost-always-winner-takes-all">winners win by a lot and dominate the headlines</a>. Bulls on these companies <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chamath-palihapitiya-on-aws-2016-1">call them monopolies</a>. Others call them <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-01/the-war-of-amazon-apple-and-other-near-monopolies">near-monopolies</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, looking at the median daily price change of stocks is not an uplifting exercise. Companies in aggregate are mired in a multi-decade stagnation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Reminder: "The market is down" and "the market is cheap" are not equivalent statements. <a href="https://t.co/KDwdPR477B">pic.twitter.com/KDwdPR477B</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/689938431665901568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>You wouldn't think that from their valuations though. Shares of the FANG monopolies and 496 other companies fancied by the index committee at Standard &amp; Poor's change hands for a princely 1.6 times their last 12 months' revenue.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A similarly rare “profit recession” occurred in the mid-1980s on the back of dollar strength + collapsing oil prices <a href="https://t.co/BryOD1L7eZ">pic.twitter.com/BryOD1L7eZ</a></p>— Urban Carmel (@ukarlewitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/ukarlewitz/status/687867025864052736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>And when sales aren’t reliably translating into earnings, it becomes more difficult to rationally pay up for them.</p>
<p>If the sales were expected to grow substantially, it would of course make sense to some degree. But I have to wonder: to what degree? I would happily pay two-times sales for Netflix, but the price as of this writing is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=NFLX+Key+Statistics">six to seven times</a>. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=GOOG+Key+Statistics">Ditto Google</a>. Amazon is a relative bargain at less than <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=AMZN+Key+Statistics">three-times sales</a>.</p>
<p>And at <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=fb+Key+Statistics">17-times sales</a>, one is left wondering how soon investors think Facebook will be a $26-trillion dollar company.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/groditi/status/688103640767184896">https://twitter.com/groditi/status/688103640767184896</a></p>
<p>Or maybe something else is at work? Guillermo’s chart shows the returns of four different factor-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Starting from the red line at the bottom: <a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251616/ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf">Value</a>, <a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251465/ishares-msci-usa-size-factor-etf">Size</a>, <a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/products/256101/ishares-msci-usa-quality-factor-etf">Quality</a>, and <a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251614/ishares-msci-usa-momentum-factor-etf">Momentum</a>.</p>
<p>And he makes a heck of a point: It would be strange for this to persist for any length of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NickatFP/status/689916329785077760">https://twitter.com/NickatFP/status/689916329785077760</a></p>
<p>Especially in such an unusual context.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Mentions of "deflation" during earnings calls... <a href="https://t.co/cNDJc8Wdfl">pic.twitter.com/cNDJc8Wdfl</a></p>— Yield Curve (@TenYearNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/TenYearNote/status/689916179440271360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>And when we have a pretty big distraction looming on the horizon. It was <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/01/21/deflation-and-what-to-do-about-it-in-13-charts/">true last year</a> and it’s true now: Deflation is a thing.</p>
<p>Being “a thing” means that it’s more than just a topic of conversation during exchanges between managements and the analysts who love them. It means that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up just <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">0.7% in the 12 months ended December 2015</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The rent is too damn high, and that's why the CPI is staying in positive territory <a href="https://t.co/tdefGrbW9X">https://t.co/tdefGrbW9X</a> <a href="https://t.co/kZgS9pZXLV">pic.twitter.com/kZgS9pZXLV</a></p>— Real Time Economics (@WSJecon) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSJecon/status/688581523772149762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>And since the whole reason it was positive at all is consistent growth in rents, you have to wonder if deflation is already here.</p>

<p>And whether deflation will bring a recession along with it. As Andrew Levin points out in the linked note, there has not been an instance since 1970 when the industrial sector shrank as quickly without the economy following it downward, often into recession.</p>

<p>Though not cause for alarm on its own, the mood of most consumers is far from buoyant. This has come up a lot here in the United States amid the ongoing presidential race, which is likely to feature at least some degree of populism on both sides of the political spectrum — perhaps even more than most expect.</p>
<p>Over the summer, I bet a friend a nice dinner that Hillary Clinton will lose the Democratic nomination, and though it’s still a long shot, <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary">I look a lot less crazy now</a>.</p>
<p>A good rule for when investment people invoke politics is to stop listening. So I won’t blame you for rolling your eyes. I only bring it up to highlight something that I don’t think is so well understood in the global investment community: American optimism is being tested. What’s especially sad is that negative readings on this particular measure used to be quickly reverting statistical aberrations. Not any more.</p>
<p>You can kind of see why. <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/pd/SNAPsummary.pdf">Just shy of 46 million Americans are on food stamps</a>. This is not a sign of broad prosperity.</p>

<p>Neither is falling goods prices something to brush off. To me, this chart screams "declining pricing power." Remember: Investing is not about correctly forecasting economic data. It's about figuring out the degree to which reality is reflected in an asset's price. Whether it indicates a capital "R" Recession or just a lowercase really bad time for anyone in the business of selling things to consumers, this chart does not contain good news.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If US Q4 GDP lands at 0.6% qoqAR (GDPNow!), 2015 growth will be roughly in line with its average since mid-2009 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fed</a> <a href="https://t.co/brLqKZdeGb">pic.twitter.com/brLqKZdeGb</a></p>— Martin Enlund 🦆🚁 (@enlundm) <a href="https://twitter.com/enlundm/status/688802815632891904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Though it’s important to keep one quarter’s GDP print in context. Martin Enlund makes a great point: 2015 won’t look terrible on an annual basis even if the fourth quarter figures wind up at the low end of recent <a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx?panel=1">GDPNow</a> forecasts.</p>

<p>And GDPNow — the favorite forecasting model of economic hipsters — isn't infallible. We could very well get a great GDP print in the fourth quarter, and it wouldn't be out of line with the tool's recent history.</p>

<p>But there is the little matter of what happens next. Let’s consider the case of China, currently the world’s largest exporter of volatility. We polled <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers, and <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/14/how-poorly-will-chinas-economy-perform-in-2016/">53% of them think</a> the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-growth-idUSKCN0UX11Y">IMF’s 6.3% annual GDP growth forecast</a> is too high. History shows they are likely to be correct.</p>
<p>Ian Bremmer also <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/23/geopolitical-disorder-in-a-g-zero-world/">knows a thing or two about the world</a>, so his skepticism about these forecasts should be taken seriously.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Chart (GS): China's heavy dependence on investment - <a href="https://t.co/Jse3lt0A6N">pic.twitter.com/Jse3lt0A6N</a></p>— (((The Daily Shot))) (@SoberLook) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoberLook/status/689968659633197056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Especially since China hasn't quite managed to wean itself off its dependence on investment for continued growth.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Taiwan 2015 export orders in worst slide in 6 years, more rate cuts seen - <a href="https://t.co/FIbQcnZLjD">https://t.co/FIbQcnZLjD</a> <a href="https://t.co/76QgOWppVW">pic.twitter.com/76QgOWppVW</a></p>— (((The Daily Shot))) (@SoberLook) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoberLook/status/689960400331390984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>And things might still soften from here. The linked article makes two critical points: First, these are export orders, not exports. That means that this series will materialize in actual trade flows in two to three months' time.</p>
<p>Second, a lot of exports from Taiwan are sent to Chinese factories owned by Taiwanese companies to then be exported again. That means the share of GDP coming from investment in China might rise simply because exports fall. This is not a positive development.</p>

<p>But this is. Kind of. Shenzhen is the city directly adjacent to Hong Kong on the Chinese mainland, and it’s also the home of a booming technology sector. This has created a sense of promise in the city. In November, the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4ea8e320-9420-11e5-b190-291e94b77c8f.html">reported</a> that residents in Shenzhen could look forward to strong wage growth, in contrast to stagnating pay packets across the border in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The existence of growth is a good thing, but the intensity of change in the value of a square foot should make you wonder how scarce  growth really is. And what happens if that growth dissipates?</p>
<p>And zoom out for a second. If you assume <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers are right that 2016 GDP growth in China will come in below 6%, strip out the nearly 50% of growth that comes from investment and then consider how rapidly prices are changing in the economic zones where there is organic growth. It’s hard to walk away thinking that the aggregate will perform well.</p>

<p>Yet the "oil is undervalued" argument persists. Don't get me wrong: This is a fantastic chart. Isn't it remarkable how tidily the investment community's perceptions of value for oil center on $80 a barrel?</p>

<p>It's a bit surprising how infrequently oil has traded at $80 on an inflation-adjusted basis over the last 150 years though. Clearly, things have changed since the sepia-toned days when the first North American commercial oil well was <a href="http://www.canadacool.com/location/oil-springs-first-commercial-oil-well/">drilled in Oil Springs, Canada</a>. But within the last 20 years, oil has traded across nearly its entire historical price range.</p>

<p>For those who aren’t yet familiar with <a href="http://srvo.org/introducing-the-unterest-rate">unterest rates, it may be tempting to also feel that there’s not much room for central banks to accommodate further.</a> <a href="http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/magazine/summer-2014/is-fed-intervention-effective-ask-the-shadow-rate">Here’s a quick primer</a> on what that shadow rate actually is and why it’s useful. But in brief, the shadow rate is a calculation that allows you to keep using other economic models when headline rates are trapped at the zero bound. To a policymaker, this is quite a useful thing.</p>
<p>But the conclusion of the <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jing.wu/research/pdf/WX.pdf">paper introducing the shadow rate</a> is as interesting as the rate itself: “Our estimates imply that the efforts by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy since July 2009 succeeded in making the unemployment rate in December 2013 0.13% lower than it otherwise would have been.”</p>
<p>What?</p>

<p>Is the emperor wearing any clothes?</p>
<p>If I could hear the thoughts of every other investor who works in Midtown Manhattan, I imagine they’d be saying something along the lines of “the Fed is distorting asset prices.”</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve is not useless. I was around in 2008, working in the auction-rate preferred market. It was dominated by Lehman Brothers. I know what it’s like when liquidity disappears. I’m sharply skeptical of any argument that the world would have been better off without a liquidity provider of last resort at the peak of the crisis.</p>
<p>But this time is different. The problem now is not liquidity. It’s that growth is accruing to a collection of businesses that can serve the entire world with a a tiny village of employees. I’m not sure what the formal cutoff is for what constitutes a village, but I still mean that literally. Netflix <a href="http://ir.netflix.com/secfiling.cfm?FilingID=1065280-15-6">had 2,450 full- and part-time employees as of 31 December 2014</a>. Its service is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/business/media/netflix-expands-its-streaming-service-worldwide.html">available almost everywhere on earth</a>.</p>
<p>This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. On the contrary, by the time you’re reading this, I might already own their stock.</p>

<p>Because “scale begets scale” is an iron law in technology, at least within a product cycle.</p>
<p>But what happens to the infrastructure that’s been built out to serve customers the old way?</p>
<p>For instance, what happens to the auto business when self-driving cars are widely adopted? How big will the auto parts industry be? Will it have millions of customers or a handful? How many autos will have to be manufactured as car utilization rates climb from <a href="http://ark-invest.com/webx0/how-many-cars-can-one-zipcar-replace">around 4%</a> to something closer to 100%? Since (for now) it owns the button you press to summon the car, Uber will be having a nice time. AutoZone? Not so sure. The companies that sell through them? That’s even less certain.</p>
<p>I am not predicting the end of history. Monopolies end. Progress is not immediate. Remember IBM? Ever glanced at what <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/07/22/130585002/2010-isnt-what-many-futurists-of-the-past-imagined">people thought 2010 would look like</a>?</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t poke around in the public equity markets for what will replace today’s monopolies. And it’s doubtful there are 500 companies that are worth 1.6 times sales as the economy flirts with recession and pricing power evaporates. And deflation is a thing. And the rapid growth of valuations relative to realized growth contains risk. And what’s happening in emerging markets is about more than just oil. And the returns society as a whole received from an unprecedented expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet were not that great towards the latter part of the intervention. And now we’ve got at least one Japan hanging around that needs to be unwound.</p>
<p>And against that backdrop, every risk on earth is being repriced. We can still be friends if you don’t agree with me though.</p>

<p>Because I believe this too. But I’m 27 years old now, so I have a pretty good idea of how long 20–25 years is. And the pace of innovation has quickened immensely since the first top on this chart in 1929 and, indeed, since the most recent one in 2000. It’s not going to slow.</p>
<p>So really I believe a version of this: That by the time I’m 50, I’ll have lived through an era of now-unfathomable, unprecedented prosperity. But just as this recent bout of volatility was in some ways brought to us by the letter “C,” we’ll have to wait and see what gets us there. And patiently, because it’s a long road.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-smarter"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/02/26/how-to-get-smarter/">How to Get Smarter</a></h2>
<p>It’s simple: Lever yourself with technology.</p>
<p>It’s not controversial to suggest that computers (<a href="http://genius.com/Marc-andreessen-why-software-is-eating-the-world-annotated">and the software that they run</a>) have changed a lot about the way that we live. Mainstream science documentaries are <a href="http://www.discoverychannelasia.com/shows/futurescape-with-james-woods/">already discussing the eventual emergence of a human-machine meld</a> as an inevitability. Whether that presently far-fetched idea comes to pass or not, there can be no disputing that <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/07/is-artificial-intelligence-for-real/">AI is for real</a>.</p>
<p>Any observer is bound to wonder: Will I be left behind? <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf">A widely cited estimate suggests that 47% of total US employment is at risk of being replaced by technology</a>. Think like a portfolio manager: Isn’t that the sort of risk you should hedge?</p>
<p>You can, but hedging well is a function of effort not security selection. I’m putting my money where my mouth is here: The organizing premise that CFA Institute rests on is that you can always be a better analyst. So, I’m a bit biased towards continuous improvement. If you want to take this with a grain of salt, fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>Your Loss</strong></p>
<p>We polled <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers about their comfort with technology, and the plurality (62%) of the 583 participants responded, “Comfortable — I’m a skilled user, but there’s a lot I don’t know.”</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What is your comfort level with technology?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/What-Is-Your-Comfort-Level-with-Technology.png"><img alt="What is your comfort level with technology" src="images/What-Is-Your-Comfort-Level-with-Technology.png?resize=640%2C273" title="Image: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/What-Is-Your-Comfort-Level-with-Technology.png?resize=640%2C273"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>So, what steps can one take to turn “a lot” into “a little”? The first step might be as simple as learning a few keyboard shortcuts. If, like many, you’re a daily user of Microsoft Excel, there’s no excuse not to invest a little bit of time getting faster.</p>
<p>I spent a number of years as a ski racer and coach, and I can tell you with authority that the difference between an advanced and intermediate skier is whether they are able to <a href="http://youcanski.com/gallery/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/greg-shorts-1flat-1-of-1.jpg" title="Link: http://youcanski.com/gallery/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/greg-shorts-1flat-1-of-1.jpg">lean out over the fall line</a> while turning. Using Excel without a mouse is exactly the same sort of bright-line separator. Especially if you would have answered “of course” to this poll, aspiring towards mouse-free spreadsheeting is an excellent interim goal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are resources to help you. An excellent software package called <a href="http://www.veodin.com/keyrocket/">KeyRocket</a> integrates nicely into Microsoft Office on Windows computers and shows you a little notification every time you perform an operation that could have been done more quickly with a hotkey. It also has a Chrome extension. I’m not aware of a similar program for Macs, but <a href="http://www.hotkey-eve.com/">HotkeyEVE</a> gives a similar introduction to the many shortcuts that can speed your navigation through the (highly hotkey-friendly) Mac operating system. And <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-one-key-that-infuriates-bankers-so-much-theyll-pop-it-out-of-their-keyboards-2012-5">here’s a quick explanation</a> if you’re mystified by the notion that anyone would rip F1 off of their keyboard.</p>
<p>Just as leaning out over the fall line is an introduction to a world of fast turns, deep powder, and a better life in general, adding hotkeys into your routine will leave you wondering how you ever got anything done without them. You’ll also quickly realize that they’re something of a minimum. As you start performing the same operations as before more quickly, you’ll start to wonder: What about new ones?</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye, Deus Ex Appina</strong></p>
<p>It used to be the case that if you wanted your computer to do something that it couldn’t do already, you had to wait around for someone else to build an app for you.</p>
<p>That is no longer a thing.</p>
<p>The cost and difficulty of creating your own simple apps has plummeted in recent years. And we’ll get to that. But a host of new technologies bring a great deal of the power that can be harnessed by writing simple applications into the hands of the average user, no code required. Perhaps the most widely known of these is a service called If This, Then That. It’s <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for short.</p>
<p>Its integrations run the gamut from <a href="https://ifttt.com/connect/hue/ios_location" title="Link: https://ifttt.com/connect/hue/ios_location">turning the lights on when you get home</a> to triggering alerts based on <a href="https://ifttt.com/stocks">movements in the financial markets</a> and even <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/379341-mulled-wine-for-christmas">ordering mulled wine on Christmas</a>. Presumably, you could set up an automatic light switch rave whenever one of the companies in your portfolio beats earnings or rallies sharply.</p>
<p>But that’s actually pretty picayune compared to the tools you can use to get some actual analysis done. You’re doubtless aware that data from services like Bloomberg and Reuters can be pulled easily into Excel. The <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred-addin/install_windows.html">St. Louis Fed even has its own tool</a> to pipe in the data from its excellent <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">FRED service</a> alongside the other data streams.</p>
<p><strong>But You Can Go Further</strong></p>
<p>A new service called <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/" title="Link: https://www.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a> allows you to pull in data from a substantial and growing number of web services. So, you can <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/bs/news-and-content-search-diffbot" title="Link: https://open.blockspring.com/bs/news-and-content-search-diffbot">build custom news searches</a>, overlay a <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/bs/sentiment-analysis-with-aylien">sentiment analysis</a>, and <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/pkpp1233/send-twilio-message" title="Link: https://open.blockspring.com/pkpp1233/send-twilio-message">have your spreadsheet text you</a> if people are saying nice things about you on the internet. A state of hyper-awareness is only a few alerts away.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that you can also pipe in data from <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/tags/306">Quandl</a>, <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/tags/361">Data.gov</a>, and <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/tags/15" title="Link: https://open.blockspring.com/tags/15">pretty much any website</a>. But, by the time you get around to doing stuff like that, it’s probably time to start thinking about writing actual code.</p>
<p>Which programming language should you learn? <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/choose-programming-language" title="Link: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/choose-programming-language">It’s a daunting question</a>, but it doesn’t need to be. For one thing, learning to program is a lot like learning a foreign language. At first, you will be expressing yourself with roughly the eloquence of a five-year-old. And you’ll be able to do about as much. But eventually, you’ll be able to access a whole set of conversations that made no sense beforehand. And even if you find out later that you’d prefer to have a different set of conversations, you’ll still have learned something.</p>
<p>That’s how you get smarter.</p>

<p>Coal has done a lot for humanity. It literally took us out of the cold.</p>
<p>It powered the first industrial revolution, which fueled countless advances that have made the world altogether more livable. And today hundreds of thousands of people make a difficult living pulling it out of the ground, and millions more precede them.</p>
<p>Of course, that is rapidly changing. In West Virginia, once the heart of coal country, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-only-state-where-less-than-half-its-citizens-work-2015-01-13" title="Link: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-only-state-where-less-than-half-its-citizens-work-2015-01-13">less than half of all civilian adults are employed</a>. The decline of the coal industry is not just an American phenomenon. Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces in northeastern China, once the country’s industrial heartland largely because of their abundant coal resources, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/china/21637449-after-promising-signs-renaissance-chinas-old-rustbelt-suffers-big-setback-back-cold" title="Link: http://www.economist.com/news/china/21637449-after-promising-signs-renaissance-chinas-old-rustbelt-suffers-big-setback-back-cold">have long since fallen behind</a> and are now among China’s slowest growing.</p>
<p>It’s not that hard to figure out why. Over the past five years, the <a href="https://www.quandl.com/data/ODA/PCOALAU_USD-Coal-Price?utm_medium=graph&amp;utm_source=quandl" title="Link: https://www.quandl.com/data/ODA/PCOALAU_USD-Coal-Price?utm_medium=graph&amp;utm_source=quandl">price of coal has decreased sharply</a>. The Dow Jones US Coal Index <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=4931635" title="Link: https://www.google.com/finance?cid=4931635">trades at its lowest levels ever</a>. The industry is in a tough spot.</p>
<p>And that’s before you even consider carbon emissions. Bloomberg ran an excellent story entitled “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2014-hottest-year-on-record/">2014 Was the Hottest Year on Record</a>.” A year later, they followed that up with a similarly titled piece, “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/hottest-year-on-record/" title="Link: http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/hottest-year-on-record/">2015 Was the Hottest Year on Record</a>.”</p>
<p>I hope you can see where I’m going with this. It is not controversial to say that the earth is warming. The only question is: What happens next? There are <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/17/climate-change-and-financial-stability-which-risk-is-most-critical/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/17/climate-change-and-financial-stability-which-risk-is-most-critical/">physical, transition, and liability risks to get familiar with</a>, and investors should not waste time.</p>
<p>In his excellent curation of the best resources to help investors with this, my colleague Usman Hayat, CFA, observed that despite all the headlines climate change generates, “<a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/16/climate-change-and-investment-decisions-selected-reading/">curiously there is little if any coverage of the phenomenon in traditional investment textbooks</a>.” Time to bone up.</p>
<p>There’s no question that there is an intersection. Arch Coal, long one of the largest coal producers, just <a href="http://www.archcoal.com/restructuring/">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>A driving reason for that: There is a strong case that we won’t be burning coal forever. It’s cheap, but dirty. It provided 41% of the <a href="http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/coal/">world’s electricity in 2013</a>, but to understate the case, new <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/anti-coal-protesters-target-climate-change-sceptic-peer-matt-ridley">coal projects are unpopular</a>. In the United States, coal-burning power plants <a href="http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/electricity.html">account for about 39% of the electricity generated but 77% of the sector’s carbon dioxide emissions</a>.</p>
<p>What compounds the problem for the coal industry is that continuing to use coal is a choice the world makes. And given the environmental costs associated with that choice, the world might be inclined to change its mind. So we decided to ask <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers how many years they thought it would take for coal to be phased out as an energy source. There wasn’t much of a consensus among our 730 respondents.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How many years until coal is phased out as an energy source?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/Coal-poll.png" title="Link: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/Coal-poll.png"><img alt="Coal-poll" src="images/Coal-poll.png?resize=640%2C285" title="Image: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/Coal-poll.png?resize=640%2C285"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>At least 42% of our readers project they will be dead before it happens. I got that number on the back of an envelope, but I think it’s not far from the truth. The average global life expectancy was <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends/en/">71 years</a> in 2013, so if one were to assume our readers are all 20 years old, “It’ll take more than 50 years” and “I’ll be dead before it happens” are basically the same statement.</p>
<p>And they might be right. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/asia/china-coal-power-energy-policy.html?_r=0">Coal power plants keep being built</a>. It takes a lot of assuming to think that coal will go away soon.</p>
<p>Or perhaps not. As my colleague Svi Rosov, PhD, CFA, <a href="https://twitter.com/SRosov/status/695337706042236928" title="Link: https://twitter.com/SRosov/status/695337706042236928">noted on Twitter</a>, that sure looks like an <a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/s-curve-business-23032.html">S curve</a> in adoption. These are widely thought to indicate a mature if saturated market. Technological disruption is always possible.</p>
<p>And it’s tough to handicap, but there is a compelling argument that that’s happening. The <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/us-has-more-solar-workers-than-coal-miners-2014-7" title="Link: http://www.businessinsider.com/us-has-more-solar-workers-than-coal-miners-2014-7">ranks of solar workers in the United States now outnumber coal miners</a>. There has been discussion of a <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/inside-the-dynomak-a-fusion-technology-cheaper-than-coal" title="Link: http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/inside-the-dynomak-a-fusion-technology-cheaper-than-coal">cheaper-than-coal fusion reactor</a>. That may sound like the stuff of science fiction now, but many realities of daily life today would have seemed just as farfetched 20 years.</p>
<p>And if the rumor that the White House wants to impose <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/695340409459859456">a $10-a-barrel fee on oil</a> to fund green transportation proposals has any validity, the act of politics I mentioned in my earlier tweet is at least somewhat more likely.</p>
