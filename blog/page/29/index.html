<h2 id="is-corporate-india-healthy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2013/12/04/is-corporate-india-healthy/">Is Corporate India Healthy?</a></h2>
<p>As we continue our special coverage of India, it becomes important to ask the obvious: How are Indian companies doing?</p>
<p>For that, we turn to the chief investment officer of SBI Mutual funds, <a href="http://www.sbimf.com/AboutUs/Fund_House_Expertise/Investment_Team/Navneet_Munot.aspx">Navneet Munot, CFA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I am looking at a report from the Reserve Bank of India that says corporate profitability — this is a broad group of corporations in India — is down about 2%. Now it’s still big — it’s one crore, 74 lakh crore rupees — but how does this make you feel about business fundamentals in India? Is it still a rosy picture?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navneet Munot, CFA</strong>:  There is a part of economy that has been impacted more badly, and that is the investment side of it. So companies in industrials and infrastructure, those are the ones who got impacted. But if you look at the latest results, there is another set of companies that have benefited from a weaker rupee. So those who are exporters, those who are into information technology, pharmaceuticals, engineering — they have benefited because of the weaker rupee.</p>
<p>There has been pressure, particularly in the financial sector, because given the downturn, there has been stress [over] the asset quality of the banking system. So financials have been a bit under pressure; though the banks are financial services company who cater to the retail market, they seemed to be chugging along well because the overall retail delinquencies have not increased much in this downturn.</p>
<p>By and large, I think the corporate profitability is bottoming out. Two things that kept pressure: One was that lot of people who expanded capacity, extrapolating the 9% growth that we were witnessing till 2008, came for a shock when the growth fell and the global environment turned very negative.</p>
<p>For them, there is lot of capacity which is yet to come on stream and then generate revenues and also because of the government’s slow decision making and [because] the political environment has resulted in lots of infrastructure projects which are at the last mile from lack of environmental clearance — land acquisition or forest clearance or several ministry bureaucratic clearances and they have been pending.</p>
<p>So that got impacted and also the pressure on margins because the raw material prices went through the roof, the labor cost in India was going up in excess of 15% and 20%, interest cost was going up, currency was weakening, so they got impacted on margins. But from here on, I believe, as the cycle turns, the asset turnover improves, and also the pressure on margin recedes, I see better days ahead for corporate profitability.</p>
<p><strong>I just want to drill in on one of those comments, which is, you mentioned basically companies that have dollar revenues and rupee expenses as being a particular bright point in this environment. Does that signal a return to sort of offshoring and business process outsourcing-based competitive structure for India, or is that just sort of a short-term thing?</strong></p>
<p>I think that’s quite structural because [when] all is said and done, India has an advantage in terms of having a large English-speaking, educated talent pool and the cost pressure has receded for them, while the global environment has turned positive with the growth reviving in the US and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>These companies have benefited, and also the rupee depreciation obviously is helping them. But we have other sectors who lost competitiveness between, let’s say, 2005 and 2008–2009, when our economy was doing very well, the labor cost and, as I previously mentioned, I think, the cost structure went up and the rupee was strong, so they lost competitiveness.</p>
<p>But we are seeing a renewed way of thrust on getting the competitiveness back and several sectors. Autos is a classic example, and we saw the two‑wheeler companies — the Bajaj Auto and then some others. We are gaining the market share in the world market.</p>
<p>Similarly, several companies in auto ancillaries and in engineering particularly — there are other factors where India has the advantage of R&amp;D skills and low-cost labor. Across sectors, a weak rupee is likely to help corporate India.</p>
<p><strong>You are talking about the changing international investment climate. That’s something that has fascinated me as I have kept digging into India. I wonder if you could comment on flows a little bit. How important and how closely you’re a domestic Indian investor, how closely are you watching international investors in equities and their flows in and out of the market, how material is that to you?</strong></p>
<p>They have been extraordinarily important because what happens is that foreign institutional investors now almost own 22% or so of the market cap of India. If you have adjusted for the floating stock — because a large part of the market cap is with the promoters, be it the government or the private entrepreneurs or some of the multinational companies, they own a substantial chunk of the floating stock. They are a large part of the daily volumes, and their flows dictate the market.</p>
<p>To put it simply, we dance to the tune of global investors who get, in turn, driven by the global liquidity and the global risk environment. Why it is that because we run a large current account deficit, obviously the country needs a huge amount of capital flows. The flows by these foreign investors impact the currency market, impact liquidity, and interest rates here and impact the sentiment in the equity market as well.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, the domestic savings — India has a very high household savings rate, but unfortunately a large part of that saving effect is not coming into the financial instruments but going into real assets like real estate and gold. The domestic investors are becoming very marginal players in the equity market, and that’s why the foreign investors, their flows, make all the difference.</p>
<p>If you can do a chart of last 15 or 20 years, every single year where foreign investors poured in money, the markets did well. In every year where foreign investors were sellers, market didn’t do well.</p>
<p>But I hope that going forward, domestic investors will start reallocating their savings into equities as equities are relatively becoming more attractive compared to the other asset classes and that equation may change going forward. But as of now, foreign investors are a very, very critical variable in the overall direction of our equity markets.</p>
<p><strong>I want to pick up on the current account deficit thought in a second, but first I want to go to the comment you had about domestic investors. Now, what really needs to happen in order to spur that growth in a domestic shareholder base basically? Is that something that’s just like a last-mile problem, similar to those infrastructure projects, or is that really a big challenge?</strong></p>
<p>A variety of things. In the last 20–25 years, domestic investors — just like anywhere else in the world, they came at the peak of the market. They didn’t have the experience with the equities. There were some structural flaws in the system where probably the retail investors didn’t make money.</p>
<p>Also, India didn’t have a very sustained long‑term bull market. We had markets that delivered exceptional return; next to the year 1992 are the years 1999, 2000, and then 2006–2007, but unfortunately, the retail investors came at the peak. They had bad experience, and generally, equity is still perceived as something that is very speculative.</p>
<p>Another structural factor is that we don’t have enough of 401(k) type pension plans or all the retirement savings infrastructure in place, where a good part of savings automatically go into the equity market, like in the US and some of the other parts of the world. India needs to get that right. The pension reforms have just begun, and I hope that over a longer period, given the demographics and the high savings rate, people will start investing a lot more into equity.</p>
<p>Though the infrastructure now is in place, I think in terms of whether the settlement cycle — in terms of dematerialization, the overall infrastructure of the stock exchange, corporate governance, the regulation — everything is in place, but somehow, as you mentioned, the last mile. People will need to be educated, and given the importance of the equity in their overall savings portfolio, to get inflation adjusted at times, once that is done, a lot of money can come into the market.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature is that two other asset classes where people have put money in the last 10–15 years — real estate and gold — both have done phenomenally well, even adjusted for the volatility and liquidity. That’s why [there is] this perception that it is always better to put money in real estate rather than a paper asset. That needs to change. Hopefully, I think it will change over a period of time.</p>
<p><strong>I just want to underscore for the audience that investing in gold is not just a 15-year-old trend in India. It seems like to me a 2,000- or 10,000-year-old trend. There is a cultural focus on doing that that may not be very clear to an international base of investors.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but in last couple of years, [it has] increased significantly as a percentage of our GDP: Gold imports just shot through the roof for the simple reasons that real interest rates were negative and consumer inflation was running much higher than the policy rates. And that led people into more physical assets, and then also something to do with the cycle that in the last decade, at least in the rupee terms, because the rupee deficit people made good money in gold.</p>
<p>Also another reason that — I am an Indian, so I have had a fascination for gold for 2,000 years, but having said that, in the last 20 years, we have built a very good financial market. We have built good infrastructure in terms of whether it’s banks or mutual funds, insurance companies who are reaching out to millions of investors. But still, the proportion of savings coming into financial assets has declined, particularly in last three four years, which is a bit worrisome for the policymakers and for us.</p>
<p><strong>That gets back to the current account deficit thought. I was actually just listening to Mr Shanmugaratnam — the head of the Monetary Authority of Singapore — talk about the role that a current account deficit can play. He makes the point that a current account deficit in and of itself is not intrinsically bad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you see the lighter side of a current account deficit, or is it the sort of thing that you and perhaps the market more broadly are viewing as kind of holding India back?</strong></p>
<p>As long as it’s manageable, as long as it doesn’t create extraordinary pressure on the currency market, it doesn’t lead to destabilization in financial markets, it doesn’t lead to some kind of instability in the overall macroeconomic environment, and it saw the signs between June and August when the Fed announced — or probably the Fed announced — the intention of tapering and the massive impact it could have not only on the financial markets in India but also on the sentiment in the real economy.</p>
<p>The current account deficit, it is a point where the funding becomes a day-to-day challenge that is quite worrisome. But a 1%–2% of current account deficit for a country like India, which needs to invest more than private saving, it is largely in order. If you think from a global perspective, a few countries have to run the current account deficit; if everybody runs current account surplus, it is building reserves. I think that may not be good.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, that’s definitely true. In places that need investment, that’s OK, that’s what a current account deficit is. You brought up the word “tapering.” I wanted to ask you, just how often do you think about that word? Because here in New York, we think about it quite a bit. But on the other side of the world, it may not be obvious how important is to you.</strong></p>
<p>We hear almost the same [as] what people sitting in New York [hear] because, ultimately, our markets are governed by what people in New York think. As I have mentioned earlier, the foreign investors are extremely critical for us, for the equity market, for currency, and for, recently, the bond market as well.</p>
<p>Tapering — at least in the very near term — makes some impact, but longer term, if you look at last 20 year,s every time the US Fed was increasing interesting rates or the US Federal Reserve was tightening its policy, it turned out to be good for the Indian markets.</p>
<p>The first few days or first few weeks, markets would tend to react negatively because that would mean less liquidity available in the market, but over a longer period, if the US economy is doing well, I think that generally augurs well for the Indian economy.</p>
<p>One is the trade linkages, probably whether it’s IT export, health care, or some of the other industries. And over a longer period, there is a bit of correlation between the Indian IFT [Institute of Foreign Trade], the Index of Industrial Production, and the US ISM [Institute for Supply Management], which may be 3‑ to 6-month lag. So, a revival in global growth is generally good for India.</p>
<p>But the market takes a few weeks to realize that fact, and then the first reaction, just in line with every other market in the world when Mr. Bernanke or Ms. Yellen talks about tapering, people perceive it a bit negatively. But my sense is that once the tapering starts, eventually it helps to be adding; if it is driven by strength in the US economy, I think that should be good for the Indian economy and markets.</p>
<p><strong>Does the same linkage apply to other monetary zones, or would you say that you are concerned with things coming out of the ECB [European Central Bank] as you might be with things coming out the Fed?</strong></p>
<p>If I remember correctly, it was January and February 2012 when it announced the LTRO [long-term refinancing operation], and the Indian market, despite an extremely challenging micro and political environment, markets went up 25% and for no reason but just that the ECB showed signs of printing a lot of money and then the LTRO money came into India.</p>
<p>We get a lot more impacted by global liquidity, the global central bank stance, and global risk on/risk off sentiments. They impact a lot our markets, at least in the very near term. Of course, in the longer term, logically it is corporate fundamentals and economic fundamentals that should drive the market, but in the interim, I think it’s the global liquidity that impacts a lot.</p>
<p><strong>I want to ask, is it challenging in that case to sort of search for value among these equities? And if you are in this environment where you have this essentially tidal international investor sentiment, how does that frustrate your hunt for adequate risk/reward for your investors inside of the country?</strong></p>
<p>It actually also creates an opportunity for a domestic investor. Somebody who has a slightly longer-term horizon and he can, rather than getting trade by the volatility which is induced by the behavior of global investors. Sometimes it creates good opportunity, so if these markets are rising just because the global liquidity environment is improving, you can be on the other side of the fence rather than vice versa. It creates an opportunity for those who can take advantage of the differential arbitrage.</p>
<p>Another aspect is that, in the last five years, we would have gotten more than $80 billion from foreign investors, while the domestic investors have continuously been selling in the market. Now a large part of this money, or a bulk of this money, has chased around 50 or 60 odd stocks, and it has created a valuation gap between so-called defensives and the cyclicals.</p>
<p>Some of the stocks that foreigners are chasing — the large mega-caps within the consumer, health care, IT, and in some of the private sector retail banks — the valuations have risen there, while the rest of the market, because the domestic investors are not buying the cyclicals, had become a lot cheaper. Now I am seeing a trend where the domestic investors are focusing on finding value within those stocks which are neglected by the foreign investors.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about finding value, there is obviously the chase for value through all the listed equities, but I think if you reach into your wallet, I assume that there are some rupees there. Is that a source of worry, a source of confidence, both, or neither? It hasn’t been an easy 18 months for you probably.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, basically for Indians, gold is a dollar as such somehow because if the domestic one is not doing well and you have higher inflation, then through the weakened currency, you get the benefit in your investment and in gold.</p>
<p>Maybe people don’t talk about it, but subconsciously, it is the global diversification. Talking about as an individual, your expenses are in rupee and then you are running in rupee, and the last couple of years, the income growth has been in line with the nominal GDP growth. So, people are that way, OK. We haven’t seen investors really chasing and trying to diversify into global assets or investing overseas. We haven’t seen that trend catching up.</p>
<p><strong>One of the comments in doing this research that really surprised me came from Pradip Shah when he said that the [Reserve Bank of India] now views its job as protecting the purchasing power of currency, which again sounds a bit weird here in New York. Is that your perception? Is that translating into action to really defend the rupee? And if so, is that action viewed as credible in the market?</strong></p>
<p>Exchange rate has not been a major factor driving the monetary policy for several years, but I think there are periods when the bouts of volatility in the exchange market lead the central bank to take monetary action.</p>
<p>Having said that, the stated objective over the years has been that they want to contain volatility rather than protecting a certain level of the currency. Two things that have been a lot of the point is there — the currency will be stable if perceived inflation is well behaved, and the new governor Mr. Rajan, he has been very clear on two things.</p>
<p>One is that the primary target has to be containing inflation, and not only the wholesale inflation because that gets driven by global commodities, but the consumer inflation that impacts every household. And second is India needs to rebuild savings, so the real rates have to stay positive for some time to induce savers to come back into financial assets, to come back into deposits.</p>
<p>That’s why we need slightly higher rates, while the government and businesses have been clamoring for the lower interest rates to support growth. He thinks that we need a balance between these objectives.</p>
<p><strong>That’s it. Switching over to sort of a debt outlook, I’ve heard some chatter about a downgrade, a debt downgrade, for India the country. My country got downgraded not too long ago, and everything seems to be very much the same. Is that something that seems likely plausible or overblown? What are your feelings on that?</strong></p>
<p>Two aspects — one is that the actual event of India getting downgraded to a junk status, I think, is very, very remote. The macrofundamentals are reasonably strong, and they don’t justify that India should be in the junk category.</p>
<p>If you look at the public debt to GDP, if you look at the — there are hardly any implicit liabilities of the government, unlike most of the other parts of the world, where a very little pension liability or medical liabilities that the government has. And also, I think, even the demographic, the growth potential, the overall strength of the financial sector at a very low leverage among the households — the household balance sheets are very strong.</p>
<p>By and large, corporate balance sheets are in reasonably decent shape. India getting downgraded to junk is very, very remote, I would say. Having said that, I remember one good thing that has happened because of the threat of the downgrade; [it] has done lot of good to the country in a sense that the central government, despite this being an election year, it has been behaving very sensibly on the fiscal side because it knows that the sword of downgrade is hanging on us.</p>
<p>Because of that, the fiscal deficit has been under control, and serious reforms to consolidate the fiscal side, the budget deficit, began a year back. And I think some part would have been played by the threat of the sovereign rating downgrade of India.</p>
<p>Also, lots of reforms are taking place in the financial sector. The government has taken a lot of steps to revive growth and contain deficit. That’s a good aspect of this threat. But the actual event, I’ll be highly surprised. I’ll be shocked if S&amp;P [Standard &amp; Poor’s] takes the step and says that India doesn’t deserve an investment grade.</p>
<p>One more aspect that people neglect is that the bulk of the Indian government’s borrowing is in the domestic market. It has borrowed from the domestic banks and the households, and it has not borrowed overseas. That way, the vulnerability of India defaulting to global investors is hardly there. I’ll be very surprised if that event takes place. That’s a little overblown in that sense.</p>
<p><strong>That is certainly, probably, refreshing news to many investors. Navneet, thank you so much for joining us.</strong></p>

<h2 id="indias-important-diaspora"><a class="toclink" href="../../2013/12/03/indias-important-diaspora/">India’s Important Diaspora</a></h2>
<p>This post was written for CFA Institute and first published on <em><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/12/03/indias-importance-abroad-the-rise-of-the-indian-diaspora/">the Enterprising Investor</a></em>. </p>
<p>One cannot consider India without thinking about the massive impact that its language and culture have had abroad. Many common English words — among them, “thug,” “shampoo,” and “pundit”— have their origins in languages from the subcontinent.</p>
<p>That’s not much to go on for an investing website though. Many things are culturally relevant, yet do not directly affect the evolution of value in business. This is different.</p>
<p>For one thing, consider the rise of India as an outsourcing hub. Why is it that India was particularly well suited for that activity? Beyond being suitable, why was it chosen? For more depth on these questions, I turned to Anita Raghavan, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Billionaires-Apprentice-Indian-American-Galleon/dp/1455504025">The Billionaire’s Apprentice</a>, a book that chronicles the rise of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Gupta">Rajat Gupta</a>, former managing director of McKinsey, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a>, founder of The Galleon Group.</p>
<p>If those names are familiar, it is because they are at the center of one of the largest insider trading scandals in history. However, Gupta was perhaps as influential as anyone else in promoting the rise of India as an offshoring hub. Along with Anil Kumar, he was “<a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/39076346-49ae-11e0-acf0-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F39076346-49ae-11e0-acf0-00144feab49a.html%3Fsiteedition%3Dintl&amp;siteedition=intl&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRajat_Gupta#axzz2mRCU2Zod">the face of McKinsey in India</a>.”</p>
<p>Though the crimes these men committed are deplorable and inseparable from their stories, there is also a lot to be learned about India from them.</p>
<p><strong>Sloane Ortel:</strong> <strong>We’re here with Anita Raghavan, contributor to the New York Times, particularly its <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/author/anita-raghavan/">Dealbook website</a>, as well as to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/">Forbes</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We’re talking about her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Billionaires-Apprentice-Indian-American-Galleon/dp/1455504025" title="Link: http://www.amazon.com/The-Billionaires-Apprentice-Indian-American-Galleon/dp/1455504025">The Billionaire’s Apprentice</a>, which is both the story of the rise of Indian American elite and the fall of the Galleon hedge fund.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anita, you close the book with, “As tragic and heartbreaking as Gupta’s fall from grace is…” — Gupta, of course, being a key player in this — “…it is a sign that Indians, much like the immigrant groups before them, have attained a certain security and a once unimaginable position in America’s society.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you expand on that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anita Raghavan:</strong> When I was growing up in the United States in the 70s most of the Indians we knew were doctors, lawyers, and professors.</p>
<p>What we see today is Indians in all walks of life. We have Indian filmmakers, Indian lawyers, Indian prosecutors, Indian authors, Indian businessmen.</p>
<p>I recently was Googling and I saw that there is even an Indian visioner. Someone pays an Indian woman to provide her vision of the world.</p>
<p>When I was growing up in the 70s, the idea that anybody would pay anyone from India to provide a perspective on the globe was just unimaginable.</p>
<p>I really think that while this is a very sobering story and it’s certainly heartbreaking for Gupta’s family, it is really a sign that we as a community are no longer on the fringes of society.</p>
<p>We’re part of American society. We’re part of the fabric. We’re standing up and we’re being counted.</p>
<p><strong>One of the stories you have in “Gupta’s Rise,” I don’t know if it was about him or about someone else, but a partner was saying, “You guys are great consultants, but will our customers ever relate to you?”
It doesn’t seem like that’s so much of a concern anymore.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. Yesterday I was speaking to a group and a young man who had been at Penn in the mid 80s came up to me and he said, “When I joined the University of Pennsylvania in 1986, somebody asked me, ‘Where are you from?'”</p>
<p>“I said, ‘India.'”</p>
<p>“The person responded, ‘What tribe?'”</p>
<p>I think you’d be hard pressed to find that today.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, exactly.</strong></p>
<p>Today, Indians have a cultural identity. There was even a sitcom based on the Indian offshoring model. Indian food is enjoyed. It’s a very different picture than what it was just 20 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, exactly. To harp on what it was, what about the process of getting over here from India, this is not like just a random group of Indians. This is the best and brightest of the entire country. I mean, the process to apply for a visa, how competitive was that?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, absolutely. Both Gupta and my own father came on an F1 student visa. In those days, the only way you could get an F1 student visa is if you either found an American university to pay for your education or you could pay for it yourself. Most Indians back then couldn’t pay for it themselves, so they were completely reliant on US institutions to fund their schooling in this country.</p>
<p>It was phenomenally difficult, and of course, today Indians are being brought to the US not just for study but to work. There’s a whole new class of visa, the HB1 visa, which brings Indians over to do particular sorts of jobs, and that’s a dramatic change from what it was.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. I mean, and again, on the what it was thing, that we harp on history too much here perhaps. But I just want, to people listening at home, I mean, in 1650, this is a country that had a GDP 80 percent the size of England. That’s 50 years after Queen Elizabeth died.</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>It’s not that India is a country that has only recently developed prosperity or developed some competitiveness in the world. It’s been a power, really, for some time.</strong></p>
<p>Right, and I, of course, am from the south of India, and we’d always talked about our 5,000 year culture and which temples and wealth that was born far before America gained independence. I think in a way, the Indian diaspora in the United States has reclaimed that legacy with their success.</p>
<p><strong>How integral is that legacy in the community itself? Is it something that people would talk about? Like, would they reference a [indecipherable 05:33] that’s not been able to name a single prominent Indian leader but from ancient history, tell stories of these people or not so much?</strong></p>
<p>No, I don’t think it was as obvious as that, but I think it was an inner confidence that we had that we actually deserved a preeminent place in this world. Perhaps because of the struggles of the Indian economy, after independence, we had been robbed of that place.</p>
<p><strong>That makes a lot of sense. You see, I guess, elements of involvement with the country. In the story of Galleon Group and Raja Rajaratnam, him, of course being Sri Lankan, giving a speech at a benefit after a typhoon in Sri Lanka. It was an impassioned speech about how hedge fund managers and fishermen are the same. You see that deep level of involvement.</strong></p>
<p>I think across the diaspora both with the Sri Lankan, Rodger Putnam, but also with the Indians, I think one of the big drivers behind Rajat Gupta, who’s the central protagonist of my story, was this desire to help his countrymen back home.</p>
<p>Some would even argue that may have precipitated his crime because when he came to New York City, he got involved in philanthropy in a big way. He started trying to raise money for Indian causes. One in particular, the American India Foundation.</p>
<p>When he first set that up, he crisscrossed the country and all that he could come up with was $50,000. I think he was just so taken aback that here was this wealthy diaspora and all they could produce was a pittance.</p>
<p>On some level, I think he was tired of collecting checks and he wanted to be the one writing checks. What better way to do that than to be a billionaire?</p>
<p><strong>It is certainly an easy way to be able to cut a big check. One thing I want to touch on also is a cultural element. It may not be too easy to appreciate is just the importance of skin color in Indian. I spent time there. I was struck by the prevalence of skin lightening cream.</strong></p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>It’s $500 million annual sales industry. Raj Rajaratnam, very dark skin — did that affect him in anyway?</strong></p>
<p>I think that’s why when I approached the story, I always thought the friendship between Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, and Raj Rajaratnam on the other side, was a forced marriage.</p>
<p>It was not a natural friendship. The Indian community, as you say, is very much like the African American community. There is a premium on light skin. I think that on some level, Gupta and Kumar were only friends with Raj because of what he could offer, which of course was a clear path to money.</p>
<p>For Raj, I think there was a deep insecurity that came from his skin color. I think it really drove him. In his early days, friends remember he would say, “Look at me. I’m a dark, dark man, an ultimate outsider, but I’ve become the ultimate insider.”</p>
<p>I think he took great pride in that. Here was someone on the fringes of society who had actually managed to penetrate its inner sanctum.</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s a big deal. This place he’s coming from. At one point, there’s a chapter called “Offshorestan” in this, which can neatly encapsulate the way a lot of people thought and perhaps still think about India.</p>
<p>I mean there are a couple of great anecdotes. When McKinsey set up its office in New Delhi, a partner had to install the switchboard because India didn’t have anybody capable of doing that. That would seem to not be the case anymore.</p>
<p>Yes, I think India has come a long way from the early 90s when McKinsey set up its flagship office. That’s another way the diaspora was actually able to give back to India, because of Offshorestan.</p>
<p>The growth of the outsourcing business of legal services, business services, was a real driver of India’s economic growth during the 90s, was promoted to a large extent by the Indians in the United States who said, “Hey, we know what county can provide some of the data skills that the US needs.”</p>
<p>India, it has a large English speaking workforce. We’re hungry to work for pennies on the dollar. They basically created this new state, if you will.</p>
<p>They created this new state and it’s grown. We recently hired Cognizant Technologies to do some IT work for us. I don’t know if that’s the sort of thing that you would have seen 20 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>I guess it raises the question, what is India now? I mean it’s no longer Offshorestan. The rupee is down quite a bit. Can it be Offshorestan again or has it lost that essential cost advantage that it used to have?</strong></p>
<p>I think it has lost the essential cost advantage on the plain vanilla offshoring business. One of the great advantages of India and its people is that they are both highly numeric and they speak English, which is a rare quality.</p>
<p>You either get highly numeric or you can speak English.</p>
<p>You don’t get both in one package.</p>
<p><strong>Exactly.</strong></p>
<p>I think what India now needs to do is redouble its efforts to go higher up the food chain to get some of the more sophisticated outsourcing business that can flow from the western economies.</p>
<p><strong>Indeed, perhaps produce its own stuff. I was hoping that we would see a Tata Nano cruising around the streets of New York City, at some point.</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>As yet, no.</strong></p>
<p>As yet, no.</p>
<p><strong>I mean a $2,000 car would be pretty great. That’s a place where people understand that make things at low cost.</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. The high-end offshoring business is still a small sliver of what India exports. There’s real room for growth in that. It comes at a time when US companies are still driving to cut costs. I think that could be at the next leg.</p>
<p><strong>The one certainty in business: cost cutting.</strong></p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>This is a story about insider trading and fraud, as well as India. I need to ask, are those bad?</strong></p>
<p>Insider trading and fraud. Look, I was speaking at the branch library over the weekend. Someone raised the very legitimate question of why is insider trading a crime because there are no victims. There are no discernible victims.</p>
<p>I think insider trading is important because one of the reasons that the US market is so respected the world over is because there’s a sense that ordinary investors get a fair shake.</p>
<p>They have access to the same information that the big boys do. You really don’t see any capital market that’s as liquid and as deep as the American market. I think in large part it is because it’s a transparent market.</p>
<p><strong>Even though, there is some work to be done here. Do you have a sense that there’s a pervasive level of insider trading or there’s still a bunch of Raj Rajaratnams out there, calling up people at Intel, having them fax documents?</strong></p>
<p>I think it goes in waves, Will. I think the last big insider trading case that we had before this one was, of course, memorialized in the book “Den of Thieves” and involved a number of bankers at some of the most prominent Wall Street firms, such as Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, and that was all the way back in the late 80s.</p>
<p>I think memories are not long. Certainly after Regulation FD, at the turn of the millennium, which really created a level playing field between big institutions and small investors in terms of the information they received from companies.</p>
<p>After that was put in place, I do think that short-term event-driven funds, momentum funds, found it a lot harder to make money and started resorting to insider trading as a way to get an edge.</p>
<p><strong>If these guys obviously trading on the stuff minute-to-minute and not what you would call long term investors, necessarily.</strong></p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>It’s tough to have an edge on one thing, having an edge on 60 stocks a year, 100 stocks a year. Very, very tough.</strong></p>
<p>It’s tough to have an edge in efficient markets.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, really on anything, especially if you’re not a very smart man, as certain of us interviewing you are not.</strong></p>
<p>Another thing I find curious. You interviewed Jeff Skilling a lot. He might not jump off the page to other people but was the President of Enron, I think or CEO?</p>
<p>The CEO.</p>
<p><strong>The CEO of Enron. What is it like to reach out to somebody who has been, basically, in prison for fraud for what must be a decade at this point?</strong></p>
<p>Almost, almost a decade. One of the reasons I reached out to Jeff Skilling is that I was looking for people to tell me why Rajat Gupta got elected to the helm of McKinsey not just once but three times.</p>
<p>Of course, by the time the charges surrounding Gupta were brought, no one at McKinsey, no one who even knew him, wanted to speak on the record. There was nothing good to say about Rajat Gupta.</p>
<p>We all know, no one is black and white. I thought, “who might talk to me?” I thought, “Well, maybe Jeff Skilling will.”</p>
<p>I wrote him a letter. You have to get on the prison email system. I don’t know if you know this. It’s called “CorrLinks.”</p>
<p>He reached out to me on CorrLinks. He was a typical consultant. He gave me a step-by-step how to on navigating CorrLinks in case I started an email relationship with a number of prisoners. Actually, I have a couple right now.</p>
<p>I found him incredibly eloquent. He would write these long emails. They were clear and articulate. Every once in a while, the reality of his new life, being in prison, would intrude on our conversation.</p>
<p>One time I remember, he was trying to explain something about the structure of McKinsey, you’re only allowed an hour on the Internet or on the email system, when you’re in prison.</p>
<p>His hour was up. He had to stop the email midway. It really was midway and come back to it several hours later.</p>
<p>There was another time I wanted to share something with him and I sent him a link to a story. He said, “I can’t read it because we don’t have access to the Internet.” But he had a lot of time, and he would write these very detailed emails of Rajat, how McKinsey was structured, and some of its values. He was really perfect for history of the firm, as well.</p>
<p><strong>I always wonder if these high-powered executives who wind up in prison find themselves doing things like organizing people into cross-functional teams, or doing any of these things you might expect. Is there any sense of what his day-to-day life is like?</strong></p>
<p>He used to teach Spanish in the library. He first, I believe, started working in the library. Then he organized classes for the other prisoners in Spanish. He spent a lot of time working, at that time, on his appeal. I think one of the reasons he reached out and decided to speak to me is because he saw the Gupta case, not the Kumar case — he was very clear about this — he saw the Gupta case as a sign of the Justice Department overreaching.</p>
<p><strong>Really? Overreaching?</strong></p>
<p>He drew a distinction because with Anil Kumar, just to recollect the facts for a minute, Anil Kumar was paid by Raj Rajaratnam to give insider trading tips about companies like AMD, and Jeff Skilling thought this was abominable. But Rajat Gupta, where the dominance case was based on circumstantial evidence, Rajat Gupta was someone that Skilling felt was railroaded by the government. That’s why he decided to speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>Really? That’s a very interesting thing. He must be feeling the same about himself, to some extent.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, of course, of course.</p>
<p>No, no, that goes without saying. That goes without saying. He was very careful about not talking about his own legal case, but it goes without saying that he certainly does not feel that justice has done him proud.</p>
<p><strong>We actually got a copy of the original Enron code of ethics that <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/10/14/the-enron-code-of-ethics-handbook-from-july-2000-is-a-fascinating-read/">we blogged about on Inside Investing</a> a couple of days ago. It was really quite a fascinating read. “No corporate employee shall trade the stock,” but of course, there are stock tickers in the elevator.</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Skilling, Rajat Gupta, is something in the water at McKinsey? What’s going on? Is that a thing or is that not a thing?</strong></p>
<p>McKinsey, for most of its history, had been built on this honor-driven value culture, which, of course, was espoused by its long-time managing director, Marvin Bower. Honor-driven, values-driven might have worked when you were a small partnership and everyone sitting in a room could look everyone else in the eye and know what they were about.</p>
<p>Today, McKinsey is a global firm. I think one of the problems the firm encountered is that it had grown so much in the 1990s, but its policies, its procedures, had not kept up with the phenomenal growth.</p>
<p><strong>It had growth pains, and then, “Oh, no.”</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>In the aftermath of this whole thing — it’s no longer a headline everyday — a lot of times when people ask you about this book they go, “For heavens sake, couldn’t you find a good story?”</strong></p>
<p>That’s right, that’s right. When I started writing this book a couple years ago, I went to a black tie gala in London and I met a prominent executive of a Wall Street firm. He said, [Indian dialect] “Anita, of all the books you could write, couldn’t you write a positive book about the diaspora?”</p>
<p>It is of some frustration to the Indian community that this book captures an unfortunate episode in what has been a remarkable rise of Indians in the United States. But I think it is an important story because one of the reasons Indians are so respected and held in high esteem in this country is because we are known to be hard working, diligent, and generally deliver on what we promise.</p>
<p>Blemishes on the diaspora, like this, risk threatening our reputation. That’s why it was important for me to write the book.</p>
<p><strong>Also, as we talked about at the very beginning this notion that not everyone is perfect and the hardest-working person ever probably helps the community more than it hurts it in the long term.</strong></p>
<p>I think so, I think so. It shows that we have matured and we’re at a point where we even have our own crime. That must mean we’ve finally arrived.</p>
<p>People actually think it’s worth their while to prosecute the Indian community for crimes. Whereas, when I was growing up in the 1970s, we were too small a community to matter.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, that the people doing the prosecution were also Indian-American says about as much as could be said.</strong></p>
<p>That’s right. The official at the SEC who built up the Galleon case, Sanjay Wadhwa, and of course the US Attorney for the southern district, Preet Bharara, both Indian Americans, and are a sign of how variegated the role of Indian Americans is in American society today.</p>

<p><em>This post was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>We’ve done quite a few <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/insideinvesting/special-features/">special features</a> over the last year, but this is the first time that we are paying particular focus to a country.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for that. Obviously, India is important to the investment profession and to individual investors around the world, but so are many places. Why did we start here?</p>
<p>We began to see a number of reports focusing on India as a place that was either doomed to political infighting and runaway inflation or as the “white knight” of an investor’s portfolio: one of the few places in a growth-constrained world that was likely to see expansion over time.</p>
<p>It seems, perhaps, like all of these things may be true. And they don’t necessarily contradict each other. The interview below with <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/sunil-singhania-elected-to-global-board-of-cfainstitute/article5193480.ece">Sunil Singhania, CFA</a>, and all of the interviews and posts that we will publish over the next couple of days, represent our attempts to get leading investment thinkers to explain to us exactly how that could be.</p>
<p><strong>CFA Institute: It’s Sloane Ortel here with Inside Investing at the CFA Institute, and I’m in the New York office of CFA Institute, but I am on the phone with Sunil Singhania, who is the CIO of Equities at Reliance Mutual Funds. He’s also (in a sense) my boss’s, boss’s boss at CFA Institute. He’s on our board of governors, the first Indian ever to reach that lofty perch. Sir, I’m on my best behavior.</strong></p>
<p>Sunil Singhania, CFA: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>I want to ask you, we were just speaking, and I rattled off a bunch of questions and said, “Is it OK to talk to these”? and you said, “That’s what people usually ask.” What don’t people usually ask that they perhaps should be asking?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know whether they should be asking or not, but domestic investors generally, and I’m talking about the equity investors. They’ve had a phenomenal sort of period between 2003, and 2008, investing in equities, where they made upwards of 30/35 percent compounded returns year after year. The account now is growing, there was huge money flow, and everything was going on well.</p>
<p>What has happened in the last five years, Indian equity markets have generally been flat, and the domestic investors particularly ask, “What is long-term”? Investors who have come in, in the last four or five years, have not been any return.</p>
<p>That is what normally the investors ask, and from our perspective, the only perspectives we can share with them is that, “Yes, the last three, four, five years have been tough. There have been some things which have happened for the first time in the world in the last hundred, 200 years, and it’s more sort of a one off thing.</p>
<p>You have to look at growing economy from a longer term perspective, and that is what we try to explain. From the global investors perspective, India has always been a favorite investment destination. However, they can get confused with, you can say, a little bit more democracy than what we need. So government policies and politics is what normally the foreign investors will ask about.</p>
<p>Though again, just to give you our perspective we have seen in all the last 20 years, all government has been coalition government, and it has worked out pretty well, so the concerns are definitely there in the near term, but from our perspective they should also be looking at a slightly longer period, and they’ll get their own answers.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, in thinking about this long-term, one of the things I have to ask is, as an offshore investor who has invested in Indian equities in the past, I occasionally form part of a cohort that can be quite troubling for domestic Indian investors, where I combine with many other people in New York, and London, and elsewhere, into these flows that can really, really distort things for you over there. How important are international investor flows for you, and just how closely do you watch them?</strong></p>
<p>Listen, it’s a great question, but if you actually see the trend of the global flows, it’s almost every year has been positive despite what is happening globally, and despite what has happened in the near past in the Indian economy, in terms of a slowdown. Global investors are looking at India from a longer-term perspective, they’re looking at this 1.2 Billion population, they’re looking at a very young age. We still have a median age of less than 25 years by 2020.</p>
<p>There are things that used grows in their consumption phenomena, and as a result of which global flows have always been positive. To answer your question whether global flows are important, there are definitely very important.</p>
<p>As an economy, we import a lot of stuff. We are a growing economy, and we lack capital. For all these reasons, we definitely need capital flows into the country, not only to bridge the current account deficit, but also to give that boost which will require to set up capacities, to set up infrastructure, and that is one key reason, or one key need which will enable India to come back to that seven/eight percent growth.</p>
<p>Our own perspective is that flows into India have been really strong, even in these last three years of extreme global volatility, and uncertainty, and similar situation in domestic India. We have seen foreign investors pump almost $65 billion into the Indian equity markets. Year to date Indian equity markets, outside of Japan, are the second largest recipient of global flows.</p>
<p>We’re not taking US, because we are mostly in a domestic flow, but international flows outside of Japan, India is the second largest. Global flows are important, but at this point of time we feel that there is in fact a narrative saying that the flows should continue to be quite positive.</p>
<p><strong>When we talk about investment realities, there are probably the equities in your portfolio, but there are also the Rupees in your wallet. How do you think about your currency right now? It seems like the easy narrative for many years, when thinking about India, was that it was a place for outsourcing, and for structural cost advantages, and it seems like with a declining currency that may again be true, at least at a superficial level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think that that narrative has any resonance, or is it overly simplistic?</strong></p>
<p>Currency movements are very complex, and frankly I will admit that I am no expert on currency. Having said that, the last six months/nine months of currency movement definitely has been a little bit worrying, we have seen currency depreciate almost 25 percent before recovering a little bit. There have been multiple reasons for it. Obviously the reasons in hindsight are very easy.</p>
<p>We have had a huge trade deficit led largely by oil and gold imports, and we have also seen a scenario where the US economy and the developed economies have been recovering, and as a, you can say, a safe way of investing, investors have in fact been pouring money into India’s economy.</p>
<p>Cross-currency movements also led to some impacts which not only that Indian currency has, that we figure a lot of other emerging market currencies like Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, and so on, which have seen a similar kind of volatility.</p>
<p>Having said that, again, you can see the period from 2001 to 2010 or ’11, we saw Rupee in fact appreciate by around 15 percent over a 10 year period. It is not fair to say that the Rupee depreciation is a given year after year. We have seen normal periods where the Rupee has stayed quite stable.</p>
<p>All we need is a return to confidence. We have had a new RBI governor but now that we write policies to encourage investors to move away from investing in gold, into yielding assets, which are the financial assets, which has led to some fall in gold imports.</p>
<p>Our current account, we have to take it to looking like hitting five percent is now expected to be more like three percent. Yes, given the fact that the global world is a more volatile place, short-term currency movements are definitely the order of the day. But I’m more optimistic of a more stable Rupee, and that might be given a boost if the economy starts to recover.</p>
<p><strong>One of the things that, in compiling this special report on India for Inside Investing, one of the things that we heard first from Pradip Shah was that, in his opinion, the Indian Central Bank seems to view its role as protecting the purchasing power of currency now, which is something that, with my dollars in my wallet, I’m not used to hearing about any central bank. But it surely does give cause for optimism, and I guess increased probability of renewed stability.</strong></p>
<p>I want to ask you about the at times unequal effect that this sort of volatility can have on a population that has very wide disparities in wealth. In particular, I saw onion prices were up something like 300 percent over the last couple of months.</p>
<p>In a population where the bottom 50 percent is living on very little money, that can hit very hard. Do you think that that population, that their ability to consume in an economically productive way, is being materially impacted by this currency volatility, this food inflation?</p>
<p>You are right. The food inflation is definitely hitting the bottom rank of the population, because a significant portion of their income goes into spending on food. Having said that, India is a domestic self-reliant economy, we don’t import most of the food we consume. It’s all grown in-house, most of it. To that extent, at least our view won’t be that the movement of Rupee has caused onion prices to go up.</p>
<p>Weather patterns globally have become more erratic. We are definitely seeing impact, whether you call it global warming or increased carbonization, which is causing the weather patterns to change. In India, specifically we’re seeing standard of living going up, and as a result of this, demand for better food is going up. Our view on that, in fact, is a more positive sign, rather than negative.</p>
<p>Yet, in the near term, supply is taking it’s time to keep up pace with demand. But specifically on the equities inside we have seen not only in India, but globally, that higher prices of produce makes the farmers switch from one crop to another, and it is always a very, very short-term phenomena of significantly higher prices in any one commodity, or one produce. Also, we have had one of the best monsoons over the last 20/30 years this time.</p>
<p>The water table is at least 20 to 40 percent higher across India and the world, compared to the 10 year average. We have a very good first indication coming from the Rabi, which is a winter crop plantation, and in the next two or three months, we are definitely hopeful that even the food inflation should start to come off.</p>
<p>But very, very clearly, the currency does have an impact on almost everything, but the impact on the food prices would not be as significant, because most of the food we eat is produced in-house.</p>
<p><strong>I guess you’re dwelling on that bigger population, but departing from the food trend, I want to ask you about the effectiveness of the financial system for those very poor people. It’s common to talk about people who are under banked, or underserved. What are the impediments that stand in front of a broad-based shareholder class in India?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there a developing sense that equities are really the place to save your money, or is it still, “I’m going to buy gold, I’m going to buy housing”? Or even, “I don’t have the money to invest. I’m just going to buy food”?</strong></p>
<p>Again, the structure of the Indian population, Indian economy, is very different. We are a 1.2 billion population country. At the same time, we do have a lot of poor people, but we also have the world’s largest population of middle class, and we are also among probably the top 5-10 countries in terms of the super rich.</p>
<p>There is a wide disparity as far as the whole population is concerned. Having said that, we are a country of large savers. We, on an annualized basis, save between 30 to 35 percent. The savings rate has fallen slightly, but it is still a healthy 30 percent, of which 20 percent is the household savings.</p>
<p>With an economy size of $2 trillion, on an average we save $350- to $400 billion as households. Over the last five/seven years, what typically has happened is that a lot of money has gone into hard assets, which is real estate and gold. Largely because those asset classes have been performing very well, and as a result it…in every part of the world, investors normally chase returns.</p>
<p>This is where most of the money has gone into. As far as equity is concerned, we had seen a huge surge in a propensity to invest in equity. It is come down over the last four or five years, largely because the immediate past performance of Indian equity markets has not been that great. But this year we have started to see money not get attracted as much by gold, for sure.</p>
<p>Real estate also, to some extent, is seeing this jump of the use of it. Still, a lot of money is going in real estate, but we are clearly seeing signs of topping out, and money moving into the financial assets. Now, the beginning of this move usually is on the fixed income side, and we have seen huge improvement in flows to our own fixed income mutual funds from retail investors.</p>
<p>Banks certificate deposits are just fine being picked up then, as far as the economy is concerned, have seen record 20 percent less growth in deposit base, and it’s a matter of time before this money selectively starts to move into the equity markets.</p>
<p>We are a young nation, you know, we are only 60 years old. If you see the history of other developed nations, In their formative years, equity as a percentage of the total assets were a very small percentage, and then as the economy matured, as the investors matured, as the investor education and literacy increased, the percentage of equity in a person’s asset base started to increase. We are very sure that in India we will see that, and frankly at Reliance Mutual Fund we are very focused on investor education.</p>
<p>We do believe that investor education is the best way of attracting long-term money. In fact, as we speak, we have launched India’s first five-year lock-in product. It is a close ended product, and investors cannot redeem before five years. It’s very difficult for us to sell, because all investors want liquidity.</p>
<p>However, we have decided to invest a lot of effort and money into promoting this product, and though it might be very small in terms of size, we do believe that this is the best way of getting investors invested in our equities from a longer-term perspective.</p>
<p>To cut it short, we are in a nascent state of the economy in the financial services concern, investors are definitely looking at financial assets. We need our economy and the markets to start to grow, and we also need a lot of effort as far as investor education is concerned, and that would definitely, definitely increase the penetration of equity, which is right now one or two percent of the savings, to at least 10 percent of savings.</p>
<p><strong>I’m mindful of your time. I know I have to let you go in a second, but I would be remiss if I didn’t ask you. This report will go live one week before almost 100,000 people around the world…well, a little short of 100,000 people, but not that short, take the CFA level one exam.</strong></p>
<p>This is an organization that’s changed quite a bit probably since you took the level one exam, and I wonder if you could just sort of hit quickly on what we’re doing in India, and how it’s come to change as a percentage of what we care about as CFA Institute?</p>
<p>Right, see again, I know India that way is a very interesting country, young guys, and I mentioned the demographics because we have a huge young population in India. They are always eager to learn, and focus on education, even from parents, is very, very high. If you see CFA’s own, you can say, progress in India, almost on word-of-mouth, we have grown from maybe 20, 30 students, to almost 30 to 40,000 candidates in different levels.</p>
<p>What it basically demonstrates is that one — yes, the economy itself has grown to among the top five economies in the world. Second — financial services is a very, very key component. In fact, services as a percentage of GDP, and total services, is almost 55 percent in India, so we are a service oriented economy. We are an English-speaking economy…English is a world language, so that also makes it easy.</p>
<p>Most important is that the quality which the CFA Institute is offering is now getting interest from the students who are eager to…or even professionals who are eager to further their careers through the help of an internationally academic course. Things are quite well. In the near-term, obviously the sharp depreciation in currency has made the course a little expensive, but it’s a matter of time before the currency also stabilizes, and you consider prospects also start to recognize that.</p>
<p>As India’s Society, obviously I’m no more associated with them on a day-to-day basis, but the India Society is doing a wonderful job. We have now events almost all over the country. It is providing young professionals an opportunity to keep on focusing on continuing professional education. It’s a great networking tool. There is a special cell for job assistance, and even level three pass-outs are encouraged to attend those events.</p>
<p>All in all, there’s a great potential for a good investment oriented course, and the CFA curriculum definitely fill that. It’s exciting times, and this growth can continue for a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful. Thank you so much for contributing to this Inside Investing special report, and I really appreciate it.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Sloane, thanks for having me here.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-you-not-indexing"><a class="toclink" href="../../2013/10/10/why-are-you-not-indexing/">Why Are You Not Indexing?</a></h2>
<p><em>This post was first published by CFA Institute's</em> <em><a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor">Enterprising Investor</a>.</em></p>
<p>Conventional wisdom says that if you want to make money in the stock market, you need to exercise fanatical discipline and develop unique competence as an investment analyst.</p>
<p>Lars Kroijer thinks that’s all kind of a waste of time for most people. </p>
<p>Can his mom really do that? If she can’t, does it mean that she won't ever make money investing?</p>
<p>The big question to him is reasonably straightforward. Do you really think that you are good enough to beat the market? If not, you can invest simply in low-cost alternatives. It’s easier, cheaper, and for many investors, likely to produce better results.</p>
<p>A lightly edited transcript of our interview follows. It’s long, but worth reading. We start by talking about his career (he used to run a hedge fund) and move to talk about how he came to the idea that most investors don’t have an edge.</p>
<p>If these topics are of interest to you, <a href="http://srvo.org/enter-the-sloane-zone">be sure and subscribe to my newsletter</a>. </p>
<p><strong>CFA Institute: We’re in the London office of CFA Institute with Lars Kroijer who has just written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Investing-Demystified-Speculation-Sleepless-Financial/dp/0273781340/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381340198&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=investing+demystified">Investing Demystified: How to Invest without Speculation and sleepless nights</a>. An attractive premise!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lars Kroijer:</strong> Well, thanks for having me!</p>
<p>**Very, very pleased to do that. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Money-Mavericks-Confessions-Manager-Financial/dp/0273772503/ref=la_B003LBW3Z0_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381340468&amp;sr=1-1">your first book</a>, you outline the steps that you went through in setting up your own hedge fund where step one was hire a team, step two was get service providers…and sometime after step three you wind up rich, popular, and happy. Is that still how it works?
**</p>
<p>I’m not sure any of those three is still true, but I guess to some degree. The reason I wrote the first book was that I thought the hedge fund industry has been one where lots of things have been written and spoken, a lot of which were bad myths and misunderstandings.</p>
<p>It was generally described in very sensationalist terms where everyone became a multi‑billionaire or was a crook, whereas the industry that I had seen from the inside was really quite different from that.</p>
<p>I thought I was in a unique position to tell the story, from someone who, frankly, went into my first hedge fund interview without really knowing what a hedge fund was to joining the industry, working in it for years, and eventually launching my own fund.</p>
<p>The book was really more about that, trying to explain what the hedge fund industry is like from the perspective of someone who’s, lived a lot of facets of it. It wasn’t trying to be sensationalist. One of the reasons it ended up doing well was because a lot of people could relate to it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the best feedback I probably got was from people in the industry. Just saying they recognized a lot of the stuff, even the stupid little stories of humiliations and losing money and being overlooked and all the stuff that we all live and that people could recognize. That was actually, perhaps, the most heartwarming part of the feedback.</p>
<p>Your question, does the same thing still hold? Well, it could, I don’t know. I don’t, every hedge fund start up story is perhaps different. But what do you need? I tell people that approach me about selling hedge funds, you need three things.</p>
<p>You need a good product, you need a good investment product and you need to make sure that you’re pretty convinced that that’s the case and you love being the provider of that product, i.e., that this is not a get rich quick scheme, which some people seem to think it is.</p>
<p>You need some money to invest, that seems pretty obvious and often forgotten by people who want to start hedge funds, because they think that comes naturally. But it’s pretty hard to raise money for a hedge fund. Always was, mind you, but that’s certainly true today.</p>
<p>The one reason for that is because the media will tend to talk about the success stories, someone running billions and billions and flying helicopters and living in big houses, whereas the mundane reality is very different for a lot of people in the industry.</p>
<p>Then the third thing you need is you need to be able to sustain the business. What does that mean? That means pay the bills and keep the lights on and get the right kind of computer equipment and the right team around you. Incur the costs of complying with the regulation and keeping your service providers happy.</p>
<p>That’s no small point, actually. Because if you don’t manage a lot of money early on, you’re not going to have a lot of fee income coming in. It’s pretty obvious stuff. But that still holds true today.</p>
<p>**I’ve heard people say, there’s nobody who wakes up in the morning and says, “Gee, I really wish I had more hedge funds.”
**</p>
<p>Well, there was a time when that was the case. I think there were a lot of pension funds who woke up and said, “Oh, I must buy some hedge funds.”</p>
<p>It seems that there are fewer of those eureka moments in the pension fund industry today.</p>
<p>**Why has that enthusiasm tapered off? How are hedge funds working, really, for the clients? Is part of that lack of enthusiasm driven by a lack of returns?
**</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I think, can’t neglect the fact that the industry has grown just a staggering amount over the last decade and a half. There probably was an unmet demand that to some extent has been met.</p>
<p>Then the second thing is that the industry’s now, I think, managing $2 trillion. That’s a lot of money. That almost is the market, right? If you slap a large amount of fees and expenses on that amount of capital, well, it’s got to be pretty hard to outperform as an aggregate.</p>
<p>I’m a huge skeptic of aggregate data in the industry because I think a lot of it has lots of biases and vested interests. I struggle to see that the high fee levels can be justified, particularly because so many funds are so correlated to markets.</p>
<p>You’ve got to keep in mind you can get market exposure for 15 basis points a year. If you’re charging 200 basis point management fees a and 2,000 basis point incentive fee, you’ve got to be providing something other than that. I’m not saying it doesn’t exist because in many cases it does.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you can provide an investment product that doesn’t correlate to the markets, that’s incredibly valuable. Think of it: if you’re an insurance company you’ve got fixed liabilities, because people’s car crashes don’t depend on the market. If you’re a pension fund and people’s future retirement depends on the market you can be pretty unlucky if you don’t have enough, as you’ve witnessed in a lot of places in the US and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The premise of the product is brilliant. Uncorrelated returns are the Holy Grail of investing. If you can create that you ought to be a rock star, and a very well paid one. I just think the reality is perhaps sometimes a little bit more mundane.</p>
<p><strong>For all the sex appeal, it’s just a bunch of guys in offices.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, a lot of very, very smart guys, very well informed guys that sometimes provide a brilliant product for a very high price. That doesn’t mean they all do, but some people undoubtedly do.</p>
<p>**To your point on aggregate data, one of our authors on Inside Investing, Ted Seides, has made that point pretty well. (Check out “<a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/04/02/investment-strategy-rethinking-hedge-fund-indices/">Rethinking Hedge Fund Indices</a>“)
**</p>
<p>There’s a lot of garbage. There is in a lot of places, though. Also keep in mind that it’s hard to buy the industry. There are hedge fund index trackers. I don’t know how well they all work.</p>
<p>But a big part of even what Ted does is to pick hedge fund managers. It’s a little bit like stock pickers except you’re a hedge fund picker. If you’re good at that, that’s a very valuable thing to be good at. It includes the analysis of data, but also a lot of softer things like management, and credibility, and the strategy that they undertake, and the future of that strategy, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Again, I wrote the first book for an even simpler reason than taking a view on the industry and whether it’s good or bad. I thought there was a story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Absolutely. It a great story. Some of the reaction to it that I saw was focused on the difference between what the audience expected and what they found. Can you talk about that a little bit?</strong> </p>
<p>First of all, it’s a little bit like if you had to write a story about football and the only thing you wrote about were the top teams, and assumed that anyone who played football, anyone in the world, would like to know who played for Arsenal or Chelsea. We ended up doing very well, but that’s not actually what’s interesting about the story.</p>
<p>It’s funny, whenever I give talks what I can see resonates most with people are our early failings.</p>
<p>The misery of trying to start a hedge fund with very little money is much more interesting to people than whether you made a billion, or a million, or a $100,000 because that’s the story they’ve read in “Forbes Magazine” ten times. Also, what does it actually take? Who do you go to? Who do you call?</p>
<p>I think something a lot people resonate with is, this presumption that if I were to start a hedge fund…the generic “I.” If one were to start a hedge fund I could call my 10 best friends and they’d turn up with some money.</p>
<p>I was certainly guilty of that myself. Very quickly i saw the error of my ways…Very little money actually turns up when the rubber hits the road.</p>
<p><strong>If you shift to the average investor, hedge funds, obviously —</strong> <strong>very complicated industry, lots of things going on there. But is this the thing that the average investor can even try to grok?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the average investor probably has hedge fund exposure, through their pension fund or even indirectly through their insurance company or their bank. So you have an exposure, but it’s very hard for you to understand what that exposure exactly is. And that’s probably an issue.</p>
<p>But taking a step back, frankly, for the retail investor, a lot of times they simply wouldn’t be allowed to invest in a hedge fund, just size constraints, qualified investor constraints, i.e. so many specific rules here in the UK regarding being approached, even, by hedge funds for the purpose of investing.</p>
<p>If you’re not an expert in hedge funds, I would strongly encourage you to look elsewhere to put your money, only because here’s a product and you know it might be interesting, but one thing you know for sure is that it’s expensive. And so you’re looking at a very expensive product where you’re not an expert. But you think, “Well, maybe I should let other people try to pick the best ones.”</p>
<p>**I’m going to ask a stupid question. Are fees actually important?
**</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I don’t think it’s a stupid question at all, actually. It’s a very good one because frankly, if you look at…I’m struggling to think of any other industry where high fees are not somehow correlated with better service or a better product, most places that’s the case.</p>
<p>Otherwise the higher‑fee end of the spectrum would self‑destruct. Frankly, other than perhaps government spending, where else can you be horribly inefficient with other people’s money and it not coming back to bite you?</p>
<p>Economic theory would suggest that if there is an expensive product that seems to thrive, so it must be valuable. Which, not to lead you into the second book, but that’s why I wrote the second book, because it actually starts with a very, very different premise, which is one of saying, “Well, who are you to ask?” Which is really saying, “Are you able to distinguish?”</p>
<p>So you know on the one hand, you’re paying a lot for something. On the other hand, there are very, very cheap alternatives, and you can’t convince me the very expensive ones in the aggregate make sense, if you’re blindly throwing darts. So you shouldn’t try at all.</p>
<p>You should index. This is the premise of the second book, is this whole idea of, do you have an ability or edge to beat the market? And I argue and I certainly think that the vast majority of people don’t. Well, in the aggregate, you can’t because in the aggregate, that is the market.</p>
<p><strong>You are the market. But why don’t most people have that capacity?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, if you think of someone who buys or sells stocks in the market, what is the market? It’s an aggregation of a ton of sometimes extraordinarily well‑informed investors with access to better information than you, better analysis, better access to management, to industry experts, to execution, to understanding data flow, statistical analysis, etc., etc. It’s just extremely hard for my mom to compete.</p>
<p>So the price…at the end of that whole sausage factory called the market of analysis and insight is a price that reflects the aggregate opinion of the market participants. No disrespect to my mom, but for my mom to essentially go in and say, “I know better,” that’s a pretty tall order. There’s every likelihood that she cannot.</p>
<p>Then add to that that she’s probably at a huge cost disadvantage. She is charged more to trade. She will probably trade frequently, which is a terrible idea. If she buys, she will buy on the offer and sell on the bid, even something as small as that, which for the the less liquid stocks actually matters.</p>
<p>There’s also every academic study backing the fact that even trying makes no sense for her, unless she is a rare, rare case of someone who is able to consistently beat the market.</p>
<p>When I say beat the market, there’s another thing there. I could go out and buy…pick a random stock. Say, Vodafone or since there are mainly American listeners, Microsoft. Let’s say I go and buy Microsoft and it skyrockets tomorrow. That doesn’t mean I had edge. It might mean I was lucky.</p>
<p>So eliminate that. Incidentally, Microsoft could decline massively in value tomorrow. That also doesn’t mean I didn’t have edge. You can’t turn around and say that either.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to prove or disprove edge. I hate to say it, this sounds awful, but you have to look inside yourself and say, “Well, what are the chances that I have it?” And when you’re at an analytical disadvantage, information disadvantage, and a huge cost disadvantage, the chances are very, very small.</p>
<p>So what I’m trying to do in this book is to say, “Well, on the basis of the premise that you probably don’t have edge, what should you do?”</p>
<p>**This book, the subtitle, again, is “How to Invest Without Speculation.” We did another “Inside Investing” thing where we asked a bunch of guests, what are the differences between those two things? I wonder, your thoughts on that. (Editor’s note, Read responses from <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/insideinvesting/2013/02/28/speculation-versus-investment-its-all-a-matter-of-semantics/">Howard Marks</a>, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/03/01/investing-vs-speculation/">Martin Fridson</a>, <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/insideinvesting/2013/02/27/what-is-the-difference-between-investing-and-speculation-2/">Robert Hagstrom</a>, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/03/04/investment-vs-speculation-using-the-minsky-criteria/">Brad McMillan</a>, and <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/03/05/speculation-and-investment-communicating-the-differences-in-style/">Malcolm Trevillian</a>)
**
“Invest without speculation.” First of all, the subtitle partly came about because of the publisher….So you’re putting me a little bit on the spot here, and the sleepless nights bit also, but the whole point is, what do you do with your money in the long term when you don’t claim to be someone who can beat the market and speculate and outperform and gamble? I’m not saying those all associate, but what if you just want your money to grow slowly, boringly, in a way that makes sense for your risk level over the long term?</p>
<p>That’s what I associate with sensible, what I call rational investing. Because it’s rational if you accept that you can’t beat the market, and there’s very little speculative about that. In fact, you’re trying to take speculation out of it. You’re trying to say, “I know I don’t know a lot.”</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind, what I’m saying, lack of edge doesn’t mean you’re stupid. In fact most professors would be adhering to this strategy. So there’s this kind of investing. Some of the smartest minds will do this. They will simply say, “I don’t think I can beat the market. Or I don’t have the time, I have a day job,” or, “I hate being wrong.”</p>
<p><strong>Or even, “I want to go walk on the beach sometimes. I just don’t want to do it anymore.”</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, look at myself. I stopped running money in hedge‑fund world. I invest only in index funds. I don’t think you can…When I was doing it, I found a really great edge. But I also believe that it is bloody hard.</p>
<p>I don’t think you can do it half. The whole that you can come home from work at 5:00, look at some talk show about stocks, then pick which one — where they’re right and where they’re wrong, and then go buy some stocks the next morning before you go to work. I just think it’s wrong. I just think there’s every chance you’re going to do a little bit worse.</p>
<p>So don’t. It’s hard‑earned money. It’s pretty boring, all right? Over time there’s every reason to think that you will do better and by cumulative, quite staggering amount. I think you should index, on the basic premise that you don’t have edge.</p>
<p><strong>The trick then is index funds.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. If we can for a second, because it’s easier to understand, just think about stock markets. Obviously, you should not only think about stock markets. Say the S&amp;P is an index to think about. So why do I think, if the world was only S&amp;P that you should play the index?</p>
<p>It’s because you don’t think you can beat the markets, you don’t think you can reallocate capital within that index in such a way that you generate a superior return profile. The byproduct of that is that the investment product you’re trying to get is extremely simple.</p>
<p>A monkey couldn’t put it together, but a computer can very, very cheaply which is why they cost ten bps a year, or 0.1 percent, and trade very little, so there are those added advantages.</p>
<p>You are essentially buying securities in the proportion that the market has determined for you, so you are coming along in the market, if you will.</p>
<p>Why does that make sense? Well, because you don’t think you can do better. Why does that make sense? Well, because you don’t have edge.</p>
<p>That’s what you should do in the S&amp;P 500. Now suppose you added an alternative, which is the Euro Stoxx 50 — that’s the main European stock index — and you had those two, S&amp;P and Euro Stoxx 50. How should you allocate between those two?</p>
<p>Again, the market is allocating in terms of capital weighting, so you allocate them in proportion to their values. Why is that? That’s because you don’t know better than the market and that’s what the market has done. Now if there was added advantage from selling S&amp;P 500 down 10 percent and buying the Euro Stoxx 10 percent, then the market would presumably do that.</p>
<p>Extend that logic to all equity markets and all currencies around the world. I argue that you can create an extraordinarily diversified product by simply buying the world equity index. You can do that through one index tracker, so you’re talking one security for all your equity holdings, and you get an extremely cheap, because it is that simple.</p>
<p>It’s a very simple index to buy, because you’re buying one stock and that represents sometimes thousands of underlying securities, across a range of capitalized sizes, and geographies and industries. You’re widely diversifying and you are getting the world equity exposure. Do that and it is very simple.</p>
<p>It happens to be theoretically — like academic theory — not far from what they were all ranting on about 30 years ago, before anyone could actually, properly do it.</p>
<p>Back then it was very easy. You had these great academic theorists and brilliant minds talk about the risk‑free rate, which sounds like an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Then you can buy and you’ve seen the capital market line and the correlations, and all that stuff, you smile faintly at them. Back then it really meant the US, because that was the only real market. Then eventually…Even when I went to college ‑‑ I’m 41 years old, I’m not that old ‑‑ we’re really talking the maybe Europe and Japan. That was pretty much it.</p>
<p>Now it’s 50 countries, right? Why is India any worse than the US? There’s no reason you would expect them to do any better or any worse, relative to its risk levels. But you can add that incredible diversification. That product was just very, very hard to buy 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Now you can. Those products exist. In 10 years there are going to be even more of them. It’s going to be even cheaper, I expect.</p>
<p>**Isn’t it the kind of thing that as you get, let’s say my investment portfolio has $1, $10, $100 million…
**</p>
<p>Good for you. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>This is strictly a hypothetical. This is a non‑profit organization, but presumably at each of those different levels ‑‑ $1, $10, $100 million ‑‑ one percentage point of added performance is increasingly valuable in cash terms. You beat the market by one percent on a $1,000, it might not be that relevant, but on $100 million, it could probably buy something pretty nice. Is it the case that as your level of wealth rises, you should do something else? Or is that something that something that really works for everyone?</strong></p>
<p>No, I think that’s an interesting observation. It think actually that pertains much more to your risk profile. Think of it this way. Let’s say you have $100 in your account and you needed $95 next year for heart surgery. You shouldn’t buy equities. That seems pretty obvious to everyone.</p>
<p>Now let’s say you have $100 in your account and you know you have some yet‑to‑be‑determined need in retirement 40 years from now. You should probably buy some equities, because there’s every reason to think that over the long term they out‑perform inflation. There will be huge dips, but you can afford to incur those dips.</p>
<p>The question of, “What will an extra one percent do for you?” is really, other than the simple math of it, it’s a very individual question of risk, and one I touch on a lot. How should you think about this? How should you think about draw downs and the inevitable “Oh, my God, I didn’t think it could be this bad”?</p>
<p>What a one percent draw‑down means for you is quite individual. When I say individual, I doesn’t mean to the individual person, but the individual as an institution. One way to think about risk is by‑an‑large, correctly, a lot of people have discredited standard risk matrices, like standard deviations.</p>
<p>Let’s take as an example and say you have $100, and you want $150 in 30 years, but you absolutely need $120. You can say, “If I put it all in equities…”</p>
<p>Let’s say you have an expected risk premium of four, five percent above inflation, which is what it’s been historically. You can say, “…in 30 years that’s going to accumulate to X.”</p>
<p>What is the risk you’re willing to accept that you don’t get to $120? Does that mean that you die ‑‑ you and everyone you’ve ever loved? Does that mean that you can’t be a member of a golf club, which you could live with?</p>
<p>What does that mean as an individual thing? That should partly drive your allocations and acceptance of risk. I try to touch on that in the book. If you come up with a hypothetical example of someone who puts aside some money every year between ages ‑‑ I’m not going to guess your age ‑‑ call it 30 to 70, or 65, and say therefore you should have X.</p>
<p>If you believe these numbers, the standard risk, standard return expectations as an expected outcome. Now let’s say you have a minimum you absolutely need. What is the probability you’re willing to accept that you don’t get it? Is it five? Is it 10, is it 20 percent?</p>
<p>What you can do is let’s say you have a choice between the world equity markets and something very, very safe. Assume for a second it’s government bonds. Let’s say that you then allocate more toward government bonds. Well, we’d all appreciate that your expected outcome many years hence will be lower, but the certainty of that outcome will be higher. There’s less risk.</p>
<p>You can therefore go along that continuum and say, if you say, “I accept no risk,” buy a 30‑year government bond. You know you’re going to have X, but you’re also going to have very little potential upside. That’s one way you can start thinking about risk. But it’s an interesting topic.</p>
<p>I also talk a lot about insurance as something that people should avoid if they can afford not to, and money in the bank, which I argue is not without its risks. Pensions, which I argue the vast majority of people get royally taken to the cleaners by various managers, certainly in aggregate, over many, many years.</p>
<p>It’s written to my mom, although she’s perhaps a little old to do the 40‑year time horizon, unfortunately.</p>
<p>**Perhaps it is a little late for her.
**
She’ll probably actually live another 40 years.</p>
<p>**The book is “Investing Demystified,” which you can buy on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Investing-Demystified-Speculation-Sleepless-Financial/dp/0273781340">Amazon</a>.
**</p>
<p>It’s just out, in fact, earlier this week.</p>
<p>**Just out this week. It has got some very inspiring upward‑facing arrows on the front of it.
**</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go, and I didn’t have anything to do with those….</p>
<p><strong>I encourage everyone to pick it up. Thank you so much Lars!</strong></p>

<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>What's the probability of a fundamental shift in the way humans store and exchange value? </p>
<p>For many years, Paul Brodsky has been a partner at QB Asset Management, a firm that recently folded into <a href="http://kopernikglobal.com/">Kopernik Global Investors</a>. He's been writing about this question for almost all of them.</p>
<p>We began part one of our conversation talking about Plato’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">Allegory of the Cave</a>, which Paul uses to introduce his thinking about monetary policy. <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2014/08/Are-You-Sure-your-Money-is-Worth-Anything-Our-Interview-with-Paul-Brodsky.mp3">Click here to listen to part one</a> of a wide-ranging discussion about the mechanics of the global system of interchange.</p>
<p>We began part two with a question from <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIntuitInvest">Jason Voss</a> that is likely at the top of many investor's minds: what is the catalyst that spurs the radical shift we are discussing? <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2014/08/Are-You-Sure-your-Money-is-Worth-Anything-Our-Interview-with-Paul-Brodsky-Part-2.mp3">Click here to listen to the audio</a>.</p>
