<h2 id="what-is-good-research"><a class="toclink" href="../../2013/08/27/what-is-good-research/">What Is Good Research?</a></h2>
<p><em>This post was first published by CFA Institute's</em> <em><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/09/20/what-is-good-research-our-interview-with-tom-brakke-cfa/">Enterprising Investor</a>.</em></p>
<p>We were privileged to have Tom Brakke, CFA, stop by our offices in New York City a few weeks ago. After a multi-hour meeting where many of us talked about all sorts of things, I managed to wrangle Tom into a quick interview.</p>
<p>Before posting the interview, I’ll say that if you don’t already follow Tom <a href="https://twitter.com/researchpuzzler">on Twitter</a> or on his excellent blog, <a href="http://researchpuzzle.com/">The Research Puzzle</a>, then you are probably missing out. He is a regular font of provocative thoughts, and that can be one of the most useful things in the world. He has also written a number of excellent posts for Inside Investing, including <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/11/05/cash-as-trash-cash-as-king-and-cash-as-a-weapon/">a thoughtful look at how you should consider cash</a> and a post about <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/insideinvesting/2012/08/06/show-me-how/" title="Link: http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/insideinvesting/2012/08/06/show-me-how/">the most important question to ask about a projected rate of return</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If these topics are of interest to you, you should</strong> <a href="http://srvo.org/enter-the-sloane-zone"><strong>sign up for my newsletter</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CFA Institute:</strong> Tom, one of the things that we’ve been talking with colleagues here about is all of the barriers that exist and keep people from getting to the truth. How do you tell if research is good in this climate? How do you piece through that?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Brakke, CFA:</strong> That’s a very difficult question in terms of trying to ascertain whether research is good. I think the first place I would start is that research is not necessarily good in terms of if it’s formulaic. I would start there. Let’s just put it in the broader brush of due diligence, for example, which is what somebody, a research analyst for example, would be doing in terms of preparing a research report is in essence doing due diligence of one kind or another, and they’re trying to come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>If you’re doing due diligence, you can run through a checklist and feel like you’ve done due diligence. But that’s a check list. It’s a pre defined way of thinking about the world. When you think about a research report or the responsibilities of an analyst to do certain kinds of research, lots of times it takes that same “check the box” approach.</p>
<p>I think good research, good due diligence in general, means looking for differential information and approaching the problem in different ways. When I think about good research, I want to see that somebody’s giving me insight into the situation that I couldn’t have otherwise gotten.</p>
<p>Let’s just take written research, which we see most commonly from sell side firms, for example. It’s remarkably similar in almost all respects from firm to firm. You will see some differences. I would say focus on the differences. Focus on the different theses that somebody might use, a different approach they might take, the identification of the specific things that are unique to their study.</p>
<p>When you pull out everything say in a research report or in a communication from an analyst verbally or from a portfolio manager or anybody that’s doing things, if you take out all of the stuff that’s the same and just focus on what’s different, it’s a remarkably small amount of information. That’s where you ought to start is with the differential information.</p>
<p>A lot of times, it’s very difficult to find that, to comb through, to piece it. Because that’s not what, say a research report again. I don’t want to focus just on reports in general. But that’s not what they lead with, necessarily. You have to dig for it. You have to know what’s different.</p>
<p>The person communicating their research ideas, that’s the lead. To get all of the extraneous material away and to get that differential information requires doing things different than other people, just by definition. I think that’s the major failing of doing research or a due diligence process in general is basically following well worn steps is not a path to enlightenment, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>In talking about the differential information, you’ve hit on something else, which is the mechanics of information transmission. You’re notable in that you have several different pieces of media through which you transmit your thoughts.</strong></p>
<p>Does the substance change at all? How do you think about the way that you communicate yourself in social media in the context of…Do you change the substance to fit the medium at all? Or does the medium devalue the substance in any way?</p>
<p>Does the medium devalue the substance? In the eyes of some viewers, perhaps it does. Perhaps they don’t think that if it’s available online it can be value added. Obviously as somebody who produces information online, I disagree with that.</p>
<p>But I know that that’s a fairly common perception. In terms of what’s the right forum for a particular idea, I’ve probably gone too far in the sense that I have three different blogs that kind of do things. The original one, “<a href="http://researchpuzzle.com/">The Research Puzzle</a>” is about mostly investment process, how the industry works. Second one, which is called “<a href="http://rp-pix.com/">Pix</a>,” features charts, so there’s a visual aspect to it.</p>
<p>A pet project of mine is to convey investment information more creatively in a visual fashion than the industry typically does, which is the goal of that one. Then I’ve got a third one that’s called “<a href="http://rp-pieces.com/">Pieces</a>” that’s kind of a scrapbook of different kinds of ideas. I also do a newsletter for institutional investors that pass on information to them from others.</p>
<p>It’s a digest format that I think is of interest. Each of those has a specific purpose so that the readers of those know what they’re getting and selecting. Like I said, I probably went too far in putting things in too many different places so that it might be harder for the reader trying to find the body of my work to identify with it. To locate it, I should say.</p>
<p>I think that when I first started on Twitter, for example, a few years ago, somebody recommended following me, “Because I had great, original material, and excellent links,” was what he said.</p>
<p>I go, “That’s pretty good. That’s exactly what I’ve been trying to do.” It’s the originality. It’s the differentiation, as we just talked about, that I focus on most in trying to convey information. That if people read me, I want it to always be presented in a quality fashion of the communication as good as it can possibly be because I think that matters. I think that’s important.</p>
<p>Secondly, that the thoughts that I convey are different than they find at other places. That’s certainly the feedback that I get. Whether it’s something that I write myself, the original material, or whether it’s something I find and pass on, whether it’s via Twitter or via newsletter or in one of my blogs. That I’m really trying to put into the discussion and the communication, that I’m providing interesting things that aren’t found elsewhere.
If I can be successful at that, I can add value and it doesn’t really matter whether it’s online and available for free or whether I’m providing things directly to clients of mine that don’t otherwise appear. It doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p>My purpose is to bring that information forth, to bring that context, and to be creative about it and say, “Here’s something different that people haven’t really been focusing on.” If I can do that in a quality fashion, then I’m going to find readers that gain benefit from it, then I can hopefully gain consulting clients, too.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like to you the information has value regardless of the transmission mechanism.</strong></p>
<p>Well, you can’t just send out information and say it has value. There’s a curation aspect to it. That hopefully if I’m disseminating something, no matter the forum, that people expect that I have…it’s not that I approve of everything I send out, because sometimes I send out things that I think, for example, are well written and interesting that I don’t agree with. I think that’s part of it, too.</p>
<p>It’s not just I’m sending things out by people that agree with me on something or other. The important thing is sending out good material and getting people to think about important issues, whether I happen to agree with them or not.</p>
<p>Now, if I’m writing an original piece, they’re going to know where I’m coming from. But hopefully, you get the range of ideas that you’re providing to people. That if you do that, they’re going to respect and understand that and respond to the information that you give them.</p>
<p>**In closing, we’ve been here at CFA Institute offices for a couple of hours now talking about a wide range of events.
**</p>
<p>Yeah, all different sorts of things.</p>
<p><strong>One of the things that comes out is there are a wide variety of different sorts of investment management firms. A piece that you wrote on your blog, <a href="http://researchpuzzle.com/blog/2010/12/06/letter-to-a-young-analyst/">the letters to a young analyst</a>, you talk about the notion of a special place where an analyst can build a career. Similarly, those would ostensibly be places where a client can build some wealth.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. I think they go together, by the way. That the kind of place that can truly be a home for a young analyst or portfolio manager or any other role within an investment organization goes with the kind of place that a client can hopefully build up wealth. I think there’s a connection there.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the qualities, besides client alignment? Do they have certain typefaces on their website?</strong></p>
<p>[laughs] No. I think it’s a perspective on the long term goals of what this business ought to be about. That you are delivering value over time, and that you create value by building an organization, by building a team, by thinking thoroughly about process. If you’ve read me, I write lots and lots about investment process and investment decision making.</p>
<p>I’m kind of an evangelist for process, if you will. That doing that well is very hard work, and it takes a long time. There’s a cumulative effect of that. If you’re starting off a new firm, you’re not going to have that instantaneously. But if you do it in the right way, you’ll have it probably sooner than you think. People will recognize that both, prospective employers and prospective clients.</p>
<p>For an established firm, it’s a little bit different. Because the culture is the culture and it’s hard to change. It’s a lot easier to destroy a culture than it is to create one. I’ve seen it happen. I think it’s very much about the culture of understanding that it is a cooperative venture in the sense that you’re there for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>The purpose is the client. What you’re trying to help the client do. That is to build wealth over time.
We get into this culture of, it’s all other people’s money and we’re just slinging it around and we’re extracting our free and our mission is to grow assets and grow fees and that’s always defined ourselves.</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, that’s why there’s a gulf between what clients expect and what a lot of investment organizations are delivering. As an industry and as a profession, we need to close that gulf. It is really about managing that money as if it was our own, to make the right kinds of decisions, to be willing and able to buck the pressures of the industry, which is perhaps the hardest thing.</p>
<p>We talked about a number of these things earlier, about the misaligned incentives a lot of times, the pressures in the industry, the relative performance derbies and all the things that end up keeping us from meeting the client’s objectives instead of helping us meet the client objectives.</p>
<p>If you’re an investment professional and you land in a place where all of that is in the right perspective, not that you won’t have difficult choices and hard issues to deal with and conflicts that you have to deal with. But if you’re in a place where that’s being addressed in the right way as opposed to just, let’s build this business and make a lot of money and fend for ourselves instead of our clients, then that’s probably the core of it.</p>
<p>But there is a culture aspect to it that is, it’s soft, it’s hard to get at. A lot of times, you’ll know it when you feel it, if you will. It’s hard to see that prospectively as a young person entering the business, for example. It’s really hard to see that. But if you see it and you feel it and you get to be a part of it, one of the things I tried to reflect on and mention in that last letter to the young analyst is that you might not realize how special that is.</p>
<p>Somebody’s going to come and jangle some money in front of you and try to entice you to leave. Sometimes you need to do that. Sometimes it’s the right thing to do that. But if you don’t really appreciate for the uniqueness of the situation that you might be in, you might not think as well about that decision as you could.</p>
<p>That was really the point I was trying to make there. That if you find a home in this business that’s a right kind of home, that’s really worth a lot and you ought to value that opportunity appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Got you. Well, thank you very much, Tom.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><em>This post was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>"I realized that when I couldn't understand something that a company was saying, it wasn't my fault."</p>
<p>Mike Mayo is an outspoken analyst and a notable expert on the banking system, but the above statement is perhaps one of the most important things to come out of our hour-long conversation. </p>
<p>In it, he speaks about how investors should go about analyzing financial institutions, gives his views on the present state of the industry, and talks in particular about one surprising tack that he had to adopt to access company management. </p>
<p>We also treat some of the topics he raises in his excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exile-Wall-Street-Analysts-Themselves/dp/1118115465/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374074539&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=exile+on+wall+street">Exile on Wall Street</a>, such as the accountability of the banks, their governance structures, and the role that they have played in economic history.</p>
<p>In all, it was a scintillating exploration of the sector which sells money as a product. Growth takes on an interesting character when firms can grow at an above-average clip by simply selling more money or — as it is more typically described — making more loans. </p>
<p>Here is the full audio of <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/10/Mike-Mayo-Podcast-Part-1.mp3">part one</a> and <a href="http://cfa-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/investor/files/2014/08/Mike-Mayo-Podcast-Part-2.mp3">part two</a> of our conversation. </p>

<p><em>Note: This post was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>In the past month, many security analysts have begun asking whether the miraculous growth of the Chinese economy is headed for a standstill. </p>
<p>While we were <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/insideinvesting/2013/06/19/live-from-the-ifieiosco-investor-education-conference/">at a conference in Canada</a> last week, we noticed that <a href="http://www.shibor.org/shibor/web/ShiborJPG_e.jsp">overnight rates in China had begun to spike</a>, so we arranged to speak with Gordon Chang as soon as we got back to New York City. Gordon is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_G._Chang">world's experts on China</a> and has authored a number of articles and books on the country, in addition to speaking to the media frequently. </p>
<p>He spoke with me and my colleague <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/author/jasonvoss/">Jason Voss</a> about what's happening in China, what we can expect to happen in the future, and how the market has evolved. In addition to the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-15/china-banks-bad-loans-rise-for-sixth-quarter-as-economy-slows.html">loans that Chinese banks have made</a> and the <a href="http://www.news.com.au/business/china-building-mega-cities-but-they-remain-empty-sparking-fears-of-housing-bubble-burst/story-e6frfm1i-1226611169281">curious ghost cities that have been popping up in China</a>, we discussed the philosophy of the Chinese government and the relationship that their notable portfolio of treasuries has with the United States' future. </p>
<p>Check out the podcast below, and read on for a few clips from Gordon's excellent <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/">Forbes column</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/2013/06/20/china-panic-overnight-rate-hits-25/">On the recent spike in overnight rates</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The overnight repo rate in China has just hit 25%, an indication the credit market is now frozen. This month, liquidity tightened considerably. Two government bill auctions failed, and several banks defaulted on their interbank obligations. Overnight rates in the last few weeks surged to about 15% but had fallen back, settling in at just north of 7%. The 25% rate indicates credit is becoming unavailable. Nothing is going right for China at the moment. In the last few hours, the HSBC Flash PMI for June came in at 48.3, down considerably from the 49.2 final reading for May. The country’s problems are now starting to feed on themselves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/2013/04/14/the-biggest-threat-to-chinas-economy/" title="Link: http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/2013/04/14/the-biggest-threat-to-chinas-economy/">And on the threats to the Chinese economy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And there is a broader issue. For more than four decades, Washington has sought to “engage” Beijing and bring it into the international community. Inside the existing geopolitical order China prospered, and in the past quarter century the people who have benefited the most from the American-led system are not the Americans but the Chinese. In a peaceful world the Chinese manufactured and traded their way up through the ranks of nations and, as a consequence, transformed their country for the better. Yet their leaders no longer accept the world as it is. Once deft, subtle, and patient, Chinese diplomacy has, especially since the end of 2009, become shrill and hostile. And Beijing has increasingly set itself against America — as well as its generals and admirals. We are now hearing war talk in the Chinese capital from civilians, such as new leader Xi Jinping, and flag officers alike. Unfortunately for Chinese policymakers, the resulting controversies are occurring in conjunction with others, both internal and external. As Fitch suggested last week, more geopolitical risk is the one factor, during this period of economic fragility, that could push the Chinese economy over the edge."</p>

<p><em>I wrote this when I was recruiting the first contributors for Inside Investing, which evolved into CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>Hey! The more interesting the first few sentences of your article are, the more likely that people will continue to read on. Don’t be interesting for purely its own sake—make sure you’re topical—but it’s generally worthwhile to try and keep your writing a little bit spicy.</p>
<p>Shorter paragraphs, too, are important in terms of keeping a reader interested. Generally, a web audience will be reading on a wide variety of screens—iPhones and iPads in addition to many different sizes of computer monitors—so it’s important to make sure that what you’re writing doesn’t look like a wall of text.</p>
<p>Using short paragraphs like these not only makes your writing more approachable but also helps us to keep more options open when we eventually share your contribution with other partners.</p>
<p><strong>Headings are important too</strong></p>
<p>Breaking up your entry with sub-headings can make it easier for a reader to navigate in addition to making it easier for you to translate points from an outline to an article. Not everything will be suitable for headings—sometimes you’ll write articles that are narrative based—but if you’re laying out something that’s explicatory in tone, it can be nice to break it up.</p>
<p>Especially when laying out things pertaining to certain types of investments, it can be helpful to use bulleted lists. These sorts of lists are usually best in situations where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You’re explaining something like risk factors, which are occasionally worth spelling out but make for an awkward paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re laying out some broad cautions that can be as long as a paragraph each but would be difficult to connect together in ordinary prose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ve got at least three things to include in your bulleted list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things to do</strong></p>
<p>Pick up the phone or send us an e-mail when you’re thinking of posting! One of the most important things that we do, from our perspective, is give you a platform to write about something that is important to you and make it accessible to our audience. A great way to do that is to make sure that your content meshes with the other stuff that we have in development, but another virtue of checking in is that we know what’s coming down the pike.</p>
<p>This will also help us focus your contributions on giving the reader a clear takeaway. Believe it or not, your editors, have pictures of a <a href="http://cltampa.com/binary/80e4/chinese-takeout-box.jpg" title="Link: http://cltampa.com/binary/80e4/chinese-takeout-box.jpg">Chinese takeout box</a> above their desks to remind them how important it is to package up a deliverable from each article.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that readers can verify anything that you assert, so it’s a good idea to include hyperlinks to sources when they’re available. You can feel free to link to things that you’ve previously written, so long as it’s credible. Sometimes <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/kodak-worth-3-billion-200810013.html">this</a> is a good way to call out prior articles, and linking to articles by giving a brief description—like this article CFA Institute published about <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/insideinvesting/2012/08/06/show-me-how/">evaluating potential investment returns</a>—can give SEO efforts a boost.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to engage directly with material on other blog sites or anything else. One of the key applications of a blog is to stoke a conversation, and we’re eager to give you a platform to engage with opinion makers around the world in addition to a global audience of investors. So, if you see an op-ed that highlights an interesting point or another blog post that you’d like to engage with, feel free to.</p>
<p>For example, this quote from Paul Krugman (<a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/cnbc_and_the_bank_critics.php" title="Link: http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/cnbc_and_the_bank_critics.php">after he was sharply criticized on CNBC</a>) might give some inspiration to contribute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…people getting their news from sources like that are probably getting terrible advice about any kind of investment that depends on macroeconomics. But it’s amazing just how skewed the policy views are too.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important thing to do is to realize that you are contributing to the mission of CFA institute, which is to promote the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society. In this case, we’re setting a new standard for a mix between education and journalism, where you have a chance to be heard, shape the global discussion about investment topics, and make a difference in the way individuals think about their investments.</p>
<p><strong>Things not to do</strong></p>
<p>We have to be sticklers about a few things, mostly because we are, by nature, detail and data oriented people. We will often ask for citations for things that you might not expect. If there’s a word in your story that your teenage child might not understand, we’d suggest adding a link to a webpage that defines it.</p>
<p>More than that, we will crack down on vague assertions. “Some say that,” “Market participants seem to believe,” and “investors expect” are phrases non grata without accompanying backup. Usually we can help track down sources for most assertions, so feel free to ask for help if you’re unsure of where to go.</p>
<p>Do not overuse a good thing. Exclamation points, italics to emphasize a word, em dashes within a sentence, a clever analogy—all are good things. But used too frequently, they lose their specialness, the emphasis they are trying to create, or the clarity of writing.</p>
<p>Lastly, please don’t contribute articles that require excessive copy editing. Please be sure to proofread for standard English grammar and punctuation. Our copy editing group is certainly able to move mountains, but we’d like to make sure that they don’t need to.</p>
<p><strong>Once you’re done writing</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing you can do once you finish your article is to make sure that you send it to us. The second thing to do is to make sure you get paid. We will release payment as soon as we have an invoice and an approved article. You should receive an invoice template along with this letter that will help streamline the process of billing us for articles.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to promote your writing that we publish! Feel free to link to it from your own site, publish links to it in social media, and otherwise let your network know that you’re writing for CFA Institute.</p>
<p>This is where we’d like you to make sure that there’s a clear takeaway for the reader. Here goes: We’re glad to have you as a contributor and look forward to working together!</p>

<h2 id="sin-is-strength"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/05/07/sin-is-strength/">Sin is Strength</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this as a final paper in my last year at Fordham mostly as an excuse to play with NLTK. It was the first time I'd really done much with it.</em> </p>
<p>John Milton’s classic Paradise Lost and the book of genesis both display interesting linguistic patterns when parsed using modern textual analysis tools. The tool I have concentrated on to narrow the scope of this paper is the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for the Python programming language and its “Similar” function.</p>
<p>The similar function is capable of parsing a large text and returning other words that appear in a similar context throughout the book. For example, if I were to enter in the following code on a text that was comprised entirely of onomatopoetic dial tones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example_Text.similar(“beep”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would receive output that looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>boop bip bop</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the words “Beep,” “boop,” “bip,” and “beep” appear in similar enough contexts for the computer to think there’s more than a seventy percent probability that they mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Obviously, this examination technique gets more interesting when it is applied to actual works, because there are some surprising results.</p>
<p>Before diving into Milton and the Book of Genesis, it makes sense to take a further example to illustrate the validity of the function and its results. Along with the standard NLTK library comes a repository of millions of chat room conversations recorded in 2005. To anyone who’s familiar with the “filler” quality that words like “lol” have in adolescent conversation, the result below will demonstrate the validity of this function—each of the words below are used in chat rooms as “empty” pieces of speech:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text5.similar(“lol”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returns: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Hey and hiya lmao ty well yeah hello oh ok all haha no what yes you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, to the texts themselves. Let’s focus on one of the key events of both stories…the section focusing on Eve’s appetite for fruit.</p>
<p>The “similar” function affords us an interesting way to make a journey through a text. If we begin by asking the algorithm to find words that are used similarly to “eat,” we receive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be fear height in on place taste thee to accaron ades air Algiers all ambition apathy arioch as ascalon asp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removing place names (each of which only occur once, which confuses the algorithm) from the results, we can see that the word “eat” is used similarly to “ambition”, “fear”, and “apathy” each of the twenty-two times that it occurs in Paradise Lost.  </p>
<p>This, taken in contrast with the same interaction in the Book of Genesis, creates a very cool result. There, we get the following return from the function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be drink abram bear beast day die haran him Isaac Jacob  shur simeon thee you abidah abimael accad accept</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, removing the proper nouns and concentrating on the most interesting words, we get “drink”, “die”, and “accept” for results. That these are all identical parts of speech probably has more to do with the fact that this algorithm was designed using the King James Bible as a reference text than anything else, but the nature of the words when contrasted with Paradise Lost is very interesting:</p>

<th><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-03_at_2.23.19_PM.png"/>  Now, this can be seen in a way as the beginning of a clear disjunction between John Milton and the author of the Bible. Perhaps this disjunction can be simply explained by Milton’s having had time to reflect on the stories and is explicitly attempting to imbue the characters of Adam and Eve with literary qualities, which may have not been the ambition of the Bible Author.    We can begin to trace these disjunctions of opinion further by looking for other significant departures between these two authors. This time around, we will go straight to the heart of the matter and examine the word “sin.”  <img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-03_at_2.23.14_PM.png"/>  The number one word that comes up for similarity to “sin” in Paradise lost is “strength,” second to “crime” and “man”? This jumps off the page—and will be examined shortly—but it makes sense to spend some time on the rest of these results. First, there is probably something to be said about the more consistent position that Milton seems to be taking with these characterizations—that Sin is something that is characteristic of Man and that it’s also something bad—in contrast to the much less “colored in” position that the Book of Genesis seems to be taking. When we get results like this from NLTK—where results are not thematic and even necessarily sensical (cattle?)—there is actually thematic information in this result.  When we summarize the meaning of a word in our language, we commonly do it through the use of synonyms and antonyms. This is true of simple word constructions (“eat” is like “gorge” with a difference of degree) but we also do it commonly with more complex ideas. It is commonplace for entrepreneurs to describe their ideas as (existing company) for (new market). Such comparators are often lampooned, but there is genuine information value in saying something like “It’s just like Facebook for pandas” or “it’s a distributed social network for presentation tools.”  The thematic information that we retrieve from the lack of a consistent identity for Sin within the corpus of the Book of Genesis is that there is not an articulated position about it. Interestingly, every time that Anger—its closest synonym—shows up in the Book of Genesis it makes reference to the anger of others, so to the Bible author anger was a possession of other people that is synonymous with sin.  Perhaps because of Milton’s approach—creating a narrative out of a preexisting story—there is a more “meaty” association with sin than just the related concept of anger in Paradise Lost proper…and the concept that he has chosen—or at least that the software has interpreted him as having chosen—is the concept of “strength.”  This may very well be a case for questioning the validity of NLTK—it’s an incredible (meaning: not immediately credible) result—but it bears further examination.  Part of the reason for this must be that strength and sin are both used close to half of the time near the end of a clause in writing. About seventy percent of the time that the word “strength” appears in Paradise Lost, it’s next to a piece of punctuation. The same is close to true for Sin, which appears next to punctuation about half of the time.  There’s a more literary explanation though. If we consider the nature of what it means to disobey the word of an all-powerful creator, it’s not insane to assume that there must be some feature of strength in the action. One of the very interesting passages in paradise lost (with text line markers unfortunately lost in its tokenized state) is the phrase “With strength from truth divided,” which does actually give some support to the notion that maybe there’s a concordance between sin and strength in this text.  <strong>If you liked this post, you should <a href="http://srvo.org/enter-the-sloane-zone" title="Link: http://srvo.org/enter-the-sloane-zone">subscribe to my newsletter</a>.</strong> </th>
