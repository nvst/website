<h2 id="is-alternative-intelligence-for-real"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/01/07/is-alternative-intelligence-for-real/">Is Alternative Intelligence for Real?</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>Did you know there's an artificial intelligence (AI) that can <a href="https://faces.ethz.ch/" title="Link: https://faces.ethz.ch/">decipher your age and how attractive you are</a>?</p>
<p>Other applications have been used to make <a href="http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/googles-psychedelic-ai-art-takes-twitter-by-storm">art</a> and <a href="https://www.jukedeck.com/?ref=producthunt">music</a>. And, of course, people are <a href="http://qz.com/389647/artificial-intelligence-is-the-next-big-thing-for-hedge-funds-seeking-an-edge/" title="Link: http://qz.com/389647/artificial-intelligence-is-the-next-big-thing-for-hedge-funds-seeking-an-edge/">starting to use it to make investments</a>.</p>
<p>But the AI that makes art and music can't make investments. It's a safe bet there's at least one person who is world class at all three. And that's the heart of one of the largest questions in the world right now: Is it possible to create an AI that can match a human at a broad range of cognitive tasks?</p>
<p>To be clear, this is a challenge. There's something special about human intelligence that we're not quite able to put our fingers on yet. When Garry Kasparov played chess against IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer, it was estimated that the computer was <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/541276/deep-learning-machine-teaches-itself-chess-in-72-hours-plays-at-international-master/">checking 200 million positions a second while Kasparov was checking five</a>. Kasparov won their first tournament.</p>
<p>How would that be possible if there wasn't some sort of secret sauce inside the human brain? But technology is progressing at a furious pace, and a growing group of developers are harnessing this progress to search for the secret recipe. With that in mind, we decided to ask the readers of <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> for their opinion.</p>
<p>And, boy, did opinions vary. They should, because this is both a controversial and critical issue. That technological progress is a component of economic growth is hardly a revelation. But creating a human-quality intelligence that is native to the silicon environment of a server farm, never sleeps, and is networked to the entire world has the potential to substantially revise everything we know about how technology moves forward. Take a second and think about how such an innovation would affect your ability to find work. Just watch a relatively primitive AI <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/04/27/artificial-intelligence-has-crushed-all-human-records-in-2048-heres-how-the-ai-pulled-it-off/">play the popular smartphone game 2048</a>.</p>
<p>It's logical to think you could find a job doing manual labor. But Luke Muehlhauser, the former executive director of the <a href="https://intelligence.org/">Machine Research Institute (MIRI)</a>, says no way: "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/y9lm0/i_am_luke_muehlhauser_ceo_of_the_singularity/">Robots will be better than humans at manual labor, too.</a>""</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Is it possible to create an artificial intelligence as smart as a human?</strong><a href="http://cfa-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/investor/files/2015/11/Which-of-the-following-earnings-disclosure-events-is-the-most-important-for-investors.png">
</a><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/01/Is-it-possible-to-create-an-artificial-intelligence-as-smart-as-a-human3.png"><img alt="Is-it-possible-to-create-an-artificial-intelligence-as-smart-as-a-human3" src="images/Is-it-possible-to-create-an-artificial-intelligence-as-smart-as-a-human3.png?resize=640%2C299"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're scared, there is some good news. A plurality (35%) of the 772 respondents think achieving human level intelligence is impossible.</p>
<p>It well may be. After all, creating music and feeling emotion are entirely different things. I'm writing this while listening to "focus enhancing" music from <a href="https://www.brain.fm">brain.fm</a>, and even though the music does do a good job of keeping me on task, it's tough to think the machine felt anything while creating it.</p>
<p>No matter how far technology advances, it may just be impossible to replicate the feeling of wonder, awe, and infinite smallness that a human being experiences while staring up at the night sky.</p>
<p>But technology is getting pretty good at faking it. Last year, a poem written by an AI was <a href="https://rpiai.wordpress.com/2015/01/24/turing-test-passed-using-computer-generated-poetry/">accepted to <em>The Archive</em></a>, a literary magazine at Duke University.</p>
<p>Given that, it's understandable why 11% of respondents believe that such an intelligence already exists. Writing a poem is still a ways away from the sort of AI depicted in <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGzRB4Pnq8">Ex Machina</a></em>, but it's definitely the sort of thing that people are surprised computers can do.</p>
<p>That element of surprise is actually one of the more interesting elements about forecasting this trend. When a technology works, we immediately take it for granted. But the last time you flew on an airplane, a computer was doing most of the piloting!</p>
<p>And let's not forget that in 1895 Lord Kelvin famously said that "Heavier than air flying machines are impossible." Speaking on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, NASA's then-deputy administrator, Frederick Gregory, declared Kelvin to have been "<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/speeches/fg_kitty_hawk_12.17.03_prt.htm" title="Link: http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/speeches/fg_kitty_hawk_12.17.03_prt.htm">slightly in error</a>".</p>
<p>I wasn't able to confirm whether he dropped the microphone afterwards. But that underscores a serious point: Declaring a technological innovation impossible is a form of hubris that invites mockery. Scientist and author <a href="http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=98">Arthur C. Clarke</a> offered a great turn of phrase: "If an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible he is almost certainly right, but if he says that it is impossible he is very probably wrong."</p>
<p>So I wouldn't advise shorting technological progress. And the balance of respondents didn't. Instead, they offered divergent forecasts for when an artificial intelligence would be developed. The second largest group of respondents (32%) believed it would happen by 2045, followed by 12% who thought it would happen by 2100. 11% believed that it would be possible, but the breakthrough would not come this century.</p>
<p><a href="http://aiimpacts.org/category/ai-timelines/predictions-of-human-level-ai-timelines/" title="Link: http://aiimpacts.org/category/ai-timelines/predictions-of-human-level-ai-timelines/">The median prediction in a survey of forecasts is 2042</a>. There are plenty of reasons to take this with a grain of salt, particularly because predicting things is very hard. But if this has piqued your interest and if you'd like to learn more, I recommend first reading <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" title="Link: http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">this excellent explainer of the state of the field at the moment</a>. If then you think that this might be a trend worth investing in, <a href="https://medium.com/@NathanBenaich/investing-in-artificial-intelligence-a-vc-perspective-afaf6adc82ea#.yf2rluff6" title="Link: https://medium.com/@NathanBenaich/investing-in-artificial-intelligence-a-vc-perspective-afaf6adc82ea#.yf2rluff6">take a look at the technology from the perspective of a venture capitalist</a>.</p>
<p>And if reading this post has got you worried about a dystopic future, read <a href="http://xkcd.com/1626/">this comic</a> and chill out a bit. It might not be that bad.</p>

<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>My word of the year for 2015 is “extreme.”</p>
<p>This applies to the real world, the business world, and the financial world. So it applies at least triply to private wealth management, where the task is to provide clients with intelligible returns in a world where consistency doesn’t come easy.</p>
<p>We can focus on the myriad challenges facing the business of private wealth management, but I hope you expect nothing less of me than to think of the clients first.</p>
<p><a href="http://srvo.org/are-financial-advisers-supposed-to-get-paid">They don't care how we make money</a>. We’re in the business of giving them good outcomes, and they are beset by things to worry about.</p>
<p>Call it Daesh, ISIS, or The Islamic State, the bloodthirsty group went from a blip on the world’s radar to a sustained and growing concern this year.</p>
<p>Think of Paris. It has become harder to argue that the shrinking, flattening world will grow ever more peaceful. And our clients risk being overcome by fear. But the better part of wisdom is making good comparisons, as this <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/227815/superforecasting-by-philip-e-tetlock-and-dan-gardner/9780804136693/" title="Link: http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/227815/superforecasting-by-philip-e-tetlock-and-dan-gardner/9780804136693/">first bit of recommended reading will teach you.</a></p>
<p>If you’re worried about geopolitical threats like ISIS and how they might ruin your clients’ lives, you’d do well to remember that we are alive at arguably the best time ever.</p>
<p><a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/violence-rights/homicides/" title="Link: http://ourworldindata.org/data/violence-rights/homicides/">Homicides are sharply down in the past few hundred years</a>. <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/literacy/" title="Link: http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/literacy/">Literacy is sharply up</a>. <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/political-regimes/democratisation/" title="Link: http://ourworldindata.org/data/political-regimes/democratisation/">The world had no democracies in 1800 and now has more than 80</a>. Indeed, the second recommendation of this roundup is an <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/302858/the-better-angels-of-our-nature-by-steven-pinker/9780143122012/">832-page reminder that the world keeps getting better</a>.</p>
<p>**But for Whom?
**
Here in New York City, 57th Street <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/skyscrapers-of-57th-street-manhattan-2014-9?op=1">is now called “Billionaires’ Row”</a> after massive luxury skyscrapers were constructed recently. <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/12/04/welfare-hits-nine-year-high-under-de-blasios-leadership/" title="Link: http://nypost.com/2015/12/04/welfare-hits-nine-year-high-under-de-blasios-leadership/">But the number of people on welfare is at a nine-year high</a>.</p>
<p>That contradiction isn’t lost on many, and it isn’t without effect. It also isn’t just about money or something that can be dismissed by allusions to historical trends.</p>
<p>Experts in the management of wealth usually aren’t as familiar with the issues that come from the extreme absence of wealth. If that sounds like you, my third recommendation is really a must read. In <em><a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/218631/the-divide-by-matt-taibbi/9780812983630/" title="Link: http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/218631/the-divide-by-matt-taibbi/9780812983630/">The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap</a></em>, Matt Taibbi tells the story of the toll inequality takes on our society with a strangely refreshing righteous indignation and a number of diligently reported, extremely compelling vignettes.</p>
<p>This is a necessary read not just because it illuminates the situation of the least fortunate in the United States. It also features extremely well-reported stories of well-known investors whose research processes overreached in a way that sure looks bad.</p>
<p>In other words, our industry plays the part of bad guy in this story. And it’s incumbent upon us to understand that allegation and conclusively refute it through our behavior.</p>
<p>Because weird stuff is happening. <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151216a.htm" title="Link: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151216a.htm">You can’t say “zirp” anymore</a>. “<a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/02/the-credit-markets-are-softening-and-funding-is-tightening/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/02/the-credit-markets-are-softening-and-funding-is-tightening/">The credit markets are softening and funding is tightening</a>.” The excellent Jason Voss, CFA, has <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/15/best-of-2015-stories-for-investors/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/15/best-of-2015-stories-for-investors/">quite usefully identified a host of other issues</a>. And Scott Krisiloff, CFA, adds more <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/14/the-c-suite-speaks-countdown-to-liftoff/">every week</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever the issue, whatever the US Federal Reserve, does and whatever a barrel of oil is selling for, there is one thing that I am absolutely 100% certain of.</p>
<p>**Our Clients Are Going to Need Us.
**
As long as there are people with money, there will be demand for advice about what to do with it.</p>
<p>But the supply of advice is seemingly infinite, undifferentiated, and a great deal of it can be provided at zero marginal cost. And if your competition was limited to just CFA Institute members, you’d still be in competition with more than 140,000 other people. And you should probably add at least one zero to that number to get to reality. Don’t forget about the competition coming from algorithms either.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re here for you. Below are some key stories from the past year that will help you get a handle on how to compete, succeed, and, most importantly, give your clients what they want in 2016 and beyond.</p>
<p>And never forget: We’ll be here to help you all along the way. Thank you for the time you spend with the <em>Enterprising Investor</em>. We’re hard at work to bring you even better analysis, even more contributors, and a better reading experience in the future.</p>

<p><em>This essay was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>A fantastic piece of financial market history resurfaced this week.</p>
<p>Somebody found a 26 January 2001 research note on Enron from Bear Stearns and posted it on <a href="http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/files/ene_bsc_20010126_70_pages.pdf">Wall Street Oasis (WSO)</a>.</p>
<p>The Bear Stearns team initiates coverage on the stock (then trading at 79 3/4) with an “Attractive rating” noting the “unlimited potential in broadband services” as just one of many opportunities.</p>
<p>So there’s no way you can’t keep reading, right? I couldn’t help myself either.</p>
<p>First, you have to just take a second and think about what this company was to the world at the time. Today, it’s hard to remember Enron as anything but a classic example of hubris and fraud. But the market didn’t always know that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Already an established leader in the natural gas industry, Enron is moving rapidly — through revolutionary communications systems and interfaces — to become the world’s preeminent energy and commodities marketer, high-density Internet distributor, and distributed energy leader. <strong>We believe that Enron should be compared to leading global companies like GE, Citigroup, Nokia, Microsoft, and Intel, and that its valuation reflects this eminence</strong>.” [All emphasis mine.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And take care to note the trajectory that the market saw. Frauds can seem like the hottest ticket around. Remember: People called up Bernie Madoff asking to invest with him and he turned a lot of them down. In the market’s perception, Enron was on fire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“$98 PRICE TARGET. Our Attractive rating and 12-month price target reflect Enron’s highly successful existing businesses, customer relationships and contractual agreements; its advanced online systems and business models; and its valuation relative to potential financial results (based on both a conservative DCF and comparables analysis).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a quick tangent here. When I was a kid, my dad taught me the meaning of the term “conservative basis” as it’s commonly used on Wall Street.</p>
<p>I caught on quick. He asked me how much soda I wanted, and I said that on a conservative basis I’d need seven 12 packs.</p>
<p>So I don’t want to go back in and list all the aspects that are just ironically amusing here. But there are a couple of things that we should look at and remind ourselves to be wary of in the future. Here is a company whose long-term vision is more blindly ambitious than anything I can imagine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All told, with consistent earnings and cash flow from the Transportation business, market dominance in the Wholesale and Retail sectors, and projected hyper-growth in its Broadband business, Enron’s long-term vision is to <strong>possess unbeatable scale and scope in every business and region in which it operates</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And look how the arguments for Enron rest on fundamentally true assumptions that are just being thought of in the wrong timeframe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bandwidth Technology and Applications — The Future of Enron? By now, we have all heard of the benefits afforded Internet users through assorted bandwidth technology. Enron truly believes that this technology will fundamentally alter how business (and life in general) will be conducted in the future. Currently building out a worldwide bandwidth network, Enron is focused on having the ability not only to transmit high-content data but also to trade bandwidth as a commodity between customers. <strong>While unsupportable at this time</strong>, Enron sees a future (sooner rather than later) where earnings from bandwidth could surpass the combined earnings from the rest of the company.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something else to be wary of: buying stock in a trading operation. “These guys are great traders” is a firm foundation upon which to build magical thinking. Imagine how such a sentence could make you feel inclined to worry a lot less about the downside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Short-Term Pricing and Long-Term Demand Projections Favor Enron. We consider Enron (and other wholesale energy companies) to be ‘long volatility.’ In essence, high prices and price volatility are Enron’s friends due to the company’ s growing marketing, trading, and retail (energy management) operations. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2001, with prices decreasing from their current highs and high volatility continuing throughout the year. For the long term, we envision demand for natural gas increasing significantly faster than in the past, with domestic demand rising approximately 5–8 Tcf over the coming decade. <strong>Of course, given Enron’s flexibility and the trading culture it has established, we would expect the company to go ‘short’ volatility at some point, in advance, perhaps, of a dampening in the volatility of the gas and power markets.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the first risk in the “risks” section of this outlook spells out something that feels like it should have been a much bigger red flag. This is a paragraph that must prompt an analyst to wonder how much they are paying for growth at minimum. Think about the many logical premises that you need to grant in order to write this passage and then walk away recommending the stock.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wholesale’s Performance Overshadows Everything Else Enron Does. With the Wholesale Energy segment consistently generating 85%-plus of the company’s revenues and earnings — and a large portion being driven off of unpredictable commodity pricing volatility — <strong>we are concerned that building and maintaining a meaningful forecasting model will become virtually impossible</strong>. As with most wholesale energy companies, Enron provides analysts with little information beyond end-of-reporting-period bottom-line figures with regard to its respective marketing and trading operations. In the financial world, these types of inherently volatile and unpredictable earnings streams have historically garnered lower valuation multiples due to their lack of visibility and predictability.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At minimum, there seems to be no consideration for Wall Street’s history of valuing irregular profit streams. Maybe everything is fine at the company and revenues are just uniquely hard to predict. Wouldn’t you think that would create a valuation impairment?</p>
<p>There are some passages in between the one above and the one below that are seriously amusing. But this one will make you a better analyst.</p>
<p>I present to you (without comment) how the team came up with their $98 estimate and “Attractive rating.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For our own purposes, and because the company is seeking significant growth in several nascent businesses that are currently under development (most specifically bandwidth intermediation and content delivery, but also the Enron Net Works business area developing within the Wholesale Energy segment), we are relying primarily on two methodologies, DCF and DCF-based terminal IBITDA multiple, to value Enron. Using projections through 2005, as well as a terminal/perpetual growth rate of 4.5% and a discount rate of close to 7% (based on our calculation of Enron’s weighted average cost of capital or WACC), we arrive at a present value of around $89 per share. This discount rate figure was determined using both a tax-adjusted cost of equity and cost of debt calculation, drawing on an approximate corporate tax rate and a long-term risk free rate of 5.65% (30-year government bond rate quoted on January 24, 2001). Using a 12x terminal IBITDA multiple through our second valuation method, we arrive at a present value of approximately $108 per share. Splitting the difference between these valuation techniques, we arrive at our 12- month price objective for the shares of $98 as well as our Attractive rating.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this a just a sample of <a href="https://twitter.com/willortel/status/658425079114649600" title="Link: https://twitter.com/willortel/status/658425079114649600">all the interesting data I found</a>.

<p><em>It's fun to try and distill the zeitgeist. This essay was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>The subject of this essay is simple: Just look at the title.</p>
<p>That cake, of course, refers to a recovering global economy. The hope goes that low interest rates will persist long enough that investors can have a levered feast on discounted (and appreciating) securities.</p>
<p>And with <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html">Fed Funds futures implying just a 5% chance</a> that this week’s statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of the US Federal Reserve will contain news of a rate hike, it would be crazy not to expect the leverage component of the feast to stick around for a while.</p>
<p>But will the food be any good? There is a camp of thoughtful people who have never bought the “bull” market. Many of them haven’t turned in great performance numbers over the past few years, but it’s not like the criticisms they offer have withered on the vine. True growth is hard to come by. Financial engineering is everywhere.</p>
<p>And we’re still in emergency mode. Weird stuff happens when tools meant for emergencies — like a fire extinguisher or that credit card you gave your kid — are used constantly for seven years.</p>
<p>Of course, this all means that not much is new. Let’s unpack the data to see whether the party is likely to continue. But before I offer any analysis, it’s time for a disclaimer: There is a narrative here, but it’s mine. You need to build yours. Be critical, question my assumptions, and let me know what you think in the comments below.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Get Started:</strong> </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Chart (BAML): More investors view the current global economy as being in the "late" phase of the cycle - <a href="https://t.co/ArQ2krleja">pic.twitter.com/ArQ2krleja</a></p>— SoberLook.com (@SoberLook) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoberLook/status/656301598214344704">October 20, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>I began one of these in March by <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/03/04/14-charts-worth-your-time-apple-macro-trends-and-global-inequality/">asking if I was the only one starting to feel like it’s pretty darn late in the business cycle</a>. Markets were higher then, and nobody wrote in to make me feel less lonely.</p>
<p>Today it looks like four out of 10 professional investors would agree. This could be interpreted to mean that the fight between bull and bear is about to get a lot fairer, but take care and look at how wrong those investors were back in 2011 and 2012 before getting too confident either way.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Actually this is pretty amazing. $4.5tn worth of buybacks since 2004 vs. $158bn of cumulative flows into US funds: <a href="http://t.co/QPcXClwQF2">pic.twitter.com/QPcXClwQF2</a></p>— Tracy Alloway (@tracyalloway) <a href="https://twitter.com/tracyalloway/status/656040672298954753">October 19, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>There’s good reason to be pessimistic though. People talk about how the market is financially engineered, but it can be tough to tell if we’re talking about the amount of engineering necessary to build a paper airplane or a Boeing 777. Turns out it’s the latter.</p>
<p>Companies have spent 2,848% more money buying their own stocks than investors have moved into the stock market since 2004.</p>
<p>I guess this means that each dollar that did flow in received a significantly greater participation in the market, but it strains credulity to call something with that characteristic a robust bull market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Chart: On a "harmonized" basis US is in deflation; price declines worse than in the Eurozone - <a href="https://t.co/5uOcwPmDYO">pic.twitter.com/5uOcwPmDYO</a></p>— SoberLook.com (@SoberLook) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoberLook/status/656276662154338304">October 20, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Or this characteristic. I spent some time at a <a href="http://www.euromoneyconferences.com/usinflation.html">Euromoney Inflation-Linked Products</a>conference at the tail end of last month, and I met a number of very sharp portfolio managers who have had a tough go of things in the last few years. At the beginning of this stimulus cycle, it seemed obvious to many that inflation was going to take off and protecting your earnings against it was imperative.</p>
<p>Now it seems many believe that inflation protection is about as useful as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tgp5VZD1Ak">cloud insurance</a>. I don’t agree — look for a great article from <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/author/davidallison2/">Dave Allison, CFA, CIPM</a>, in the next week or so explaining why in some detail — but this does fall firmly into the camp of things that aren’t good news.</p>
<p>You have to dig a little to see why. These “harmonized” indices come from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teicp000&amp;plugin=1">European Central Bank (ECB)</a>, and they’re designed for comparisons across countries. This has some differences from the US CPI, perhaps most notably in that it incorporates prices from rural areas.</p>
<p>Whatever the methodological differences are, you have to take it seriously when an apples-to-apples comparison from a reputable statistical agency shows the United States’ deflationary spiral is worse than Europe’s. Perhaps our rural areas are an economic drag similar to Europe’s southern countries?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Shelter inflation continues to lead the way, accelerated to new cycle high of +3.2% yoy in September <a href="http://t.co/m49WVOHgbx">pic.twitter.com/m49WVOHgbx</a></p>— Matthew B (@boes_) <a href="https://twitter.com/boes_/status/654636452748337152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>It could dishearten you further to recall that one of the few spots where we do see sustained inflation is housing. Rising on its own, the cost of shelter doesn’t directly indicate a growing economy . . . just supply/demand imbalances in the places that people want to live. And as a result, the cost of sleeping indoors in these places is rising. That’s not expansion, that’s a price hike.</p>
<p>This is actually the point in this essay where I start to get more upbeat though. Bear with me.</p>
<p>Remember that time we built way too many homes and tons of people bought too many of them and it almost ruined everything? Remember <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ninja-loan.asp">NINJA (no income, no job, no assets) loans</a> and <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1877351_1877350,00.html">this character</a>? It turns out all that might leave a scar. Multi-family housing starts (often built by investors) are back around pre-crisis levels, but single-family housing starts are a country mile away.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">2.

<p>And setting 15% of your income on fire to rent a house every year gets tiresome after a while.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Contributions to world growth, via DB. <a href="http://t.co/V6po8fo1fY">pic.twitter.com/V6po8fo1fY</a></p>— George Pearkes (@pearkes) <a href="https://twitter.com/pearkes/status/655348362166841344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Especially if you have a job finally and are ready to get your act together.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">light vehicle sales / NFP.<br/><br/>The anomally is how low auto spending was, not how high it is. <a href="http://t.co/HOwYjPHn3a">pic.twitter.com/HOwYjPHn3a</a></p>— Guillermo :( (@groditi) <a href="https://twitter.com/groditi/status/655485452078596096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>And consumers are no longer shying away from the big ticket purchases they’ve been avoiding for years.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>
<p>So as they say, something’s got to give. The traditional way of thinking has long been that as slack dissipates from the economy, it translates into inflation. But so far translating anything into inflation has been about as easy as translating the <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/loi/faj">Financial Analysts Journal</a> into Akkadian. Good luck if you want to give it a try, you know?</p>
<p>With that said, there is important optimistic logic here. It goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>People with jobs mostly choose to live indoors.</li>
<li>It would be cheaper for many of them to own than to rent.</li>
<li>Some of those people will buy houses.</li>
<li>Big ticket purchases!</li>
<li>You need furniture and stuff for a house.</li>
<li>Consumer spending!</li>
</ol>
<p>At least that’s the theory. This logic is really just okay, since it’s not drawn from a diversity of premises. But it is intuitive that after many years of renting and unemployment, recently much more employed American consumers are ready to treat themselves. And, of course, in economics we call the subset of this logic that relates inflation and unemployment the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/phillipscurve.asp">Phillips Curve</a>.</p>
<p>For the past few years, the Phillips Curve has been something of an enigma. Nobody has seen it in a while — like <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/09/21/introducing-the-unterest-rate/">interest rates</a>. But it does make sense that incremental tightening in the labor markets will eventually flow through to higher spending and eventually inflation. At least that’s the hope.</p>
<p>Now shifting gears to China, I can remember way back to a time (this summer) when financial news channels sounded an awful lot like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs">three-minute montage of Donald Trump saying “China”</a>.</p>
<p>Now it appears that trend has abated, at least in terms of news flow.</p>
<p>But maybe it should be accelerating. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/20/investing/china-yuan-capital-outflows/">$500 billion has left China so far this year</a>. You can call it “hot money” or whatever else you want, but it stings.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">ZH chart showing that China is selling large amounts of US Treasuries via Belgium... <a href="https://t.co/lyNzfdjRxs">pic.twitter.com/lyNzfdjRxs</a></p>— Ron Rimkus, CFA (@RonRimkus) <a href="https://twitter.com/RonRimkus/status/656564020665798656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>And is almost certainly related to some of the stealthy selling of Treasuries my colleague Ron Rimkus, CFA, noted on our pipeline call recently (and tweeted about later). The money to defend your currency has to come from somewhere, after all.</p>
<p><strong>So Where Does That Leave Us?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on what you took into this article — your mental models, biases, and research — you might be thinking that the economy is about to heat up. Or you might still be thinking about that flows vs. buybacks chart and getting ready to short the market. Don’t. Yet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Look how wrong the average dopey economists has been last 6yrs on prediction where 10yr would be in 12mos <a href="http://t.co/86eEngXd5t">pic.twitter.com/86eEngXd5t</a></p>— Dividend Master (@DividendMaster) <a href="https://twitter.com/DividendMaster/status/654325222397636613">October 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Before you think you know anything, take a second to think about how bad we are at forecasting the 10-year Treasury.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">via HSBC <a href="http://t.co/rc8LrY1gtD">pic.twitter.com/rc8LrY1gtD</a></p>— Sam Ro (@bySamRo) <a href="https://twitter.com/bySamRo/status/654260556971515904">October 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>And the Riksbank rate.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">DB's Slok: Rates markets have been pricing a hike since 2009 <a href="http://t.co/JlGtXQ7h2p">pic.twitter.com/JlGtXQ7h2p</a></p>— Brattle St. Capital (@BrattleStCap) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrattleStCap/status/654326878841409536">October 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>And the Fed Funds rate. And pretty much everything else.</p>
<p>When markets could either plummet or redefine the term “rally” (which is pretty much always), the worst thing you can do is seek to be correct at the expense of being robust. So as much as you focus on coming up with a good forecast, make sure you also prepare for those times when your model is wildly off. After all, the financial reward for being right “eventually” only comes if you’re able to stick around till whenever that is. So plan for whatever could happen, not just what you think will happen.</p>

<p>It’s been 10 days since the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2015/press.html" title="Link: http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2015/press.html">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences</a> to <a href="http://scholar.princeton.edu/deaton" title="Link: http://scholar.princeton.edu/deaton">Angus Deaton</a> of Princeton University “for his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/angus-deaton-nobel-economics.html?_r=0" title="Link: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/angus-deaton-nobel-economics.html?_r=0">Press reports emphasized Deaton’s research into inequality</a> and its troubling growth in recent years. “I think inequality has gone past the point where it’s helping us all get rich, and it’s really becoming a serious threat,” Deaton said. Still, Deaton has expressed the hope that the primary legacy of his research will be his meticulous precision — his “carefulness in measurement,” as he put it.</p>
<p>Of course, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize is awarded for research in economics, not investing. That means that even though the contributions of Deaton and every other Nobelist are significant, there are material differences in how directly useful they are among the broad spectrum of investment professionals.</p>
<p>We’ve been fortunate to have a number of these distinguished figures attend CFA Institute conferences over the years, so we decided to ask <a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp" title="Link: https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a> readers to rank the contributions of these particular Nobelists.</p>

<p>A plurality (43%) of the 559 respondents pointed to the contributions of Eugene Fama as the most influential, while Robert Shiller and Daniel Kahneman’s scholarship each attracted 26% of the vote. The work of Thomas Sargent, Vernon Smith, and George Akerlof evidently wasn’t as valuable to our readers, since they each garnered 2% or less of the vote individually.</p>
<p>I went and looked at some of the speeches, interviews, and papers that these Nobel laureates have given at CFA Institute events and elsewhere, and I’ve selected some insightful ones to share with you. To increase the probability you’ll learn something new, I’ve listed them in the reverse of their ranking in the poll.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2011/sargent-facts.html">Thomas Sargent</a></strong></p>
<p>Sargent is credited with leading the (bloodless) rational expectations revolution. One of his big ideas is that the people whose actions are described by models can predict the future as well as the person who created the model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sargent discussed his work in a <a href="http://video.cfainstitute.org/services/player/bcpid3577743869001?bckey=AQ~~,AAABE5oc3_E~,Leu10fA0D1sc9Dh9wz3oyrstQJ-PkzpJ&amp;bctid=2593803962001">Take 15 interview with Ron Rimkus, CFA</a>.</li>
<li>Sargent examined <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v70.n2.6">the probability distribution function of potential future outcomes in terms of ambiguity aversion</a> at the 66th CFA Institute Annual Conference in Singapore in 2013.</li>
<li>Chetan G. Shah, CFA, reviewed Sargent’s book <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/br.v9.n1.14%40faj.2014.70.issue-6">Recursive Models of Dynamic Linear Economies</a> for the Financial Analysts Journal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2002/smith-facts.html">Vernon Smith</a></strong></p>
<p>Smith is most associated with economic experiments that put subjects in defined conditions and study their behavior. The owner of a <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2002/smith-photo.html">sweet ponytail</a>, he’s also a shoo-in for the title of “best hair” in this august company.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cynthia Harrington, CFA, interviewed Smith for <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cfm.v14.n5.2825">CFA Magazine</a>.</li>
<li>Peter Eickelberg, CFA, reviewed Smith’s paper “<a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/dig.v44.n11.12">Double Bubbles in Asset Markets with Multiple Generations</a>.“</li>
<li>Smith issued a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3179473/You-pretty-good-bubble-Sydney-Melbourne-Nobel-prize-winning-economist-Vernon-Smith-warns-property-buyers-AMP-Bank-cracks-investment-loans.html">warning about an Australian real estate bubble</a> in the Daily Mail.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2001/akerlof-facts.html">George Akerlof</a></strong></p>
<p>Initially gaining fame for the study of markets for lemons (cars that are broken), Akerlof has a made a number of wide-ranging contributions, spanning the fields of identity economics, bankruptcies, and the phenomenon of reproductive technology shock.</p>
<ul>
<li>James Surowiecki examined Akerlof’s research into <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/later">procrastination</a>.</li>
<li>Akerlof proposed <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/09/nobels.htm">a uniform tax on global carbon emissions</a>.</li>
<li>Cass Sunstein reviewed <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/oct/22/why-free-markets-make-fools-us/">Why Free Markets Make Fools of Us</a>, which Akerlof co-wrote with fellow Nobelist Robert Shiller.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2002/kahneman-facts.html">Daniel Kahneman</a></strong></p>
<p>The best quote I can find on Kahneman comes from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/16/daniel-kahneman-thinking-fast-and-slow-tributes" title="Link: http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/16/daniel-kahneman-thinking-fast-and-slow-tributes">Richard Layard</a>: “He made happiness respectable as a goal for society.” I won’t say anything more: That should induce you to at least watch the video interview.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kahneman discussed his work in a <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/08/09/take-15-daniel-kahneman-discusses-the-past-and-future-of-behavioral-finance-research-video/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/08/09/take-15-daniel-kahneman-discusses-the-past-and-future-of-behavioral-finance-research-video/">Take 15 interview with Ashvin B. Chhabra</a>.</li>
<li>Lauren Foster examined <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2011/11/28/daniel-kahneman-financial-advisers-arent-immune-from-the-illusion-of-skill/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2011/11/28/daniel-kahneman-financial-advisers-arent-immune-from-the-illusion-of-skill/">Kahneman’s warning about the stock-picking skills of financial advisers</a> for this publication.</li>
<li>Jason Voss, CFA, recounted a <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/02/06/nassim-taleb-and-daniel-kahneman-black-swan-shows-fragility-under-heavy-weight-of-anchoring/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/02/06/nassim-taleb-and-daniel-kahneman-black-swan-shows-fragility-under-heavy-weight-of-anchoring/">conversation between Kahneman and Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>.</li>

<p>A founding member of our <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/future/getinvolved/Pages/advisory_council.aspx" title="Link: https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/future/getinvolved/Pages/advisory_council.aspx">Future of Finance Advisory Council</a>, Shiller is known for his penetrating insight on behavioral finance as well as a number of prescient market calls, including the dot-com and housing bubbles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shiller delivered a <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/cp.v23.n3.4255" title="Link: http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/cp.v23.n3.4255">presentation on the housing market in 2006 called “Irrational Exuberance Revisited</a>.”</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2013/fama-facts.html">Eugene Fama</a></strong></p>
<p>Called the “father of modern finance,” Fama is most closely associated with the efficient market hypothesis and the three-factor model he created with Kenneth French.</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert Litterman <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v68.n6.1" title="Link: http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v68.n6.1">interviewed Fama for the Financial Analysts Journal</a>.</li>
