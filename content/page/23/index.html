<p><em>I first wrote this essay for CFA Institute and published it on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>They don’t usually ring a bell at the top of the market, but every once in a while somebody up and buys Time Warner.</p>
<p>If there was ringing in your ears when you heard the news, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>And neither are Time Warner or AT&amp;T. <a href="http://www.thisisinsider.com/merger-monday-october-24-caps-huge-month-for-deals-2016-10">Plenty of deals were announced on Monday last week</a>, and <em>S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence</em> says October 2016 is already the third-strongest month ever for US M&amp;A.</p>
<p>I plan to announce a slew of hostile takeovers on Halloween, so obviously that’s understated.</p>
<p>You might laugh now at my plan to merge GoPro, Six Flags, and American Airlines, and that’s fine. You can apologize in 18 months when I’ve built the world’s first transportainment empire. Our first step will be replacing both up and down escalators with waterslides. Aerial drones will capture all the fun and share it with the world on social media. Argue that we’re not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GVd_HLlps">making the world a better place</a> at your peril: This is a whole new kind of <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/13/5000-marketing-technologists-say-2015-is-the-year-of-social-local-mobile-again/" title="Link: http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/13/5000-marketing-technologists-say-2015-is-the-year-of-social-local-mobile-again/">mobile + local + social</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why So Serious?</strong></p>
<p>Given the way that <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers reacted when we asked them about the heat in the merger market, you’d think news of my plan had already leaked out.</p>
<p>We asked readers to complete a sentence:</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>October 2016 is the third-strongest month ever for M&amp;A announcements, according to <em>S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence</em>. And that’s _______.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="October 2016 is the third-strongest month ever for MA announcements according to SP Global Market Intelligence And thats _______em" src="images/Mergers-and-acquisitions-poll.png?resize=640%2C277" title="Image: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/10/Mergers-and-acquisitions-poll.png?resize=640%2C277"/></p>
<hr/>
<p>Almost three out of four respondents (74%) chose “Scary,” “Bad,” or “Troubling,” with the majority (52%) falling in the latter camp. That 52% said the high degree of merger activity suggests companies can no longer generate sufficient organic growth. That’s real: The reasoning goes that doing a deal is expensive surgery to gain a new appendage. To many, it’s not something you do when your existing arms and legs work fine.</p>
<p>But it’s also a way to build fortunes. Money managers often dislike investment banking transactions out of habit, or perhaps because skepticism sounds smart and feels good. Now is a good time to reflect on the track record of <a href="http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Teledyne-and-Henry-Singleton-a-CS-of-a-Great-Capital-Allocator.pdf">Henry Singleton</a>, who sowed and reaped an impressive fortune through smart buying.</p>
<p>There is a “trust me” element to deal making that can create substantial misfires though. One great example comes in the form of a book I have sitting on my desk: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merger-Mania-Arbitrage-Streets-Money-Making/dp/0030026024"><em>Merger Mania</em></a> by Ivan Boesky.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-20/books/bk-14238_1_corporate-takeovers-arbitrage-merger-mania">contemporary review</a> from the former editor of <em>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions</em> offers the following choice quotes:</p>
<p>“Boesky hopes to end the ‘tall tales’ about his profession by showing its calculated methods while warning that no single book can teach them.”</p>
<p>“And although the probabilities of completion versus sellout are calculations intrinsic to the arbitrageurs decision to invest, Boesky never discusses how to come up with such numbers.”</p>
<p>“This silent slap, more than the economic indignities of tender offers denounced in the book’s conclusions, shows the worst side of hostile takeovers: CEO’s inhumanity to CEO.” (This refers to a phone call that was not returned.)</p>
<p>The last one is a reminder of the special form of myopic ego that can be present alongside, in addition to, or in place of a compelling reason to affect a merger. After receipt of a bid, a management team finds itself using a rarefied, intermediated, and hopefully sexless version of Tinder. There is a straightforward obligation to shop the company around, and selling yourself can be less than dignified. The horror.</p>
<p>The actual worst side of large deals is difficult to fully describe. For starters, there’s a lot of money sloshing around to attract unethical actors like Boesky. Almost immediately after publishing <em>Merger Mania</em>, he paid a $100-million fine for insider trading and eventually <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/19/business/boesky-sentenced-to-3-years-in-jail-in-insider-scandal.html?pagewanted=all">received a three-year jail sentence</a>. The <a href="http://www.sechistorical.org/museum/galleries/wwr/wwr05a-markets-boesky.php">SEC’s historical society does a nice write-up</a>.</p>
<p>Barring the cloak-and-dagger stuff, big deals are still scary. Heath Ledger, as the Joker. lays out why as well as any professional ever could in <a href="http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/dvdsite/"><em>The Dark Knight</em></a>: “It’s not about money. It’s about sending a message.”</p>
<p>What if management’s motivation has more to do with building the biggest something than executing a strategy? Think about buying clothes for a minute: Activity can be easily and expensively confused for progress. Our desire to make sense of things can lead us to build a sophisticated narrative for manic, short-term decisions. Later in the film, the Joker <a href="http://genius.com/Christopher-nolan-the-dark-knight-hospital-scene-annotated">compares himself to a dog chasing cars</a>: “I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it!”</p>
<p><strong>General vs. Specific</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you might well think I could never be among the 14% of respondents who think these announcements are sensible and great news, or the 12% who feel they are just what the market needs to move further up the wall of worry.</p>
<p>But all I have done is show you the <a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/169/Strawman-Fallacy">straw man</a> in M&amp;A that everyone hates and nobody wants to be.</p>
<p>Investment bankers know about these stories too, and have more of them. The thing is: I can make whatever general case I want about M&amp;A and the risks involved, but specifics win this sort of argument every time.</p>
<p>What message are you getting from these mergers? Share your thoughts in the comments below, please! I find myself remembering that there are returns to the size of your platform in media and content that are outstanding, yet hard to understand from the outside. It would be nice to see the pessimist’s arrogance defeated in this case, and indeed I am left wondering how many of the folks who are scared by these deals consider themselves contrarian.</p>
<p>I look forward to any thoughts you may have.</p>

<h2 id="the-death-of-private-equity-has-been-over-reported"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/10/17/the-death-of-private-equity-has-been-over-reported/">The Death of Private Equity has been Over-Reported</a></h2>
<p><em>This was written for (and first published by) CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>Private equity’s demise has been over-reported.</p>
<p>That’s according to me and to <a href="https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/claudia-zeisberger" title="Link: https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/claudia-zeisberger">Professor Claudia Zeisberger, founder of INSEAD’s Global Private Equity Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/2016-annual-conference/" title="Link: https://annual.cfainstitute.org/2016-annual-conference/">69th CFA Institute Annual Conference</a>, Zeisberger demonstrated that private equity is very much alive, backing up her assertion with reams of data. And personally, I’m tired of hearing about the rumored death of something immortal.</p>
<p>Critics of private equity are <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/andy-kessler-the-glory-days-of-private-equity-are-over-1427661933" title="Link: http://www.wsj.com/articles/andy-kessler-the-glory-days-of-private-equity-are-over-1427661933">not hard to find</a>, and if you listen to them long enough, you’ll hear <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/private-equity-exec-charged-with-fraud-2016-03-29" title="Link: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/private-equity-exec-charged-with-fraud-2016-03-29">all kinds of stories</a> that <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/117735/private-equity-fraud-how-firms-are-ripping-their-investors">make your stomach turn</a>. No doubt, there have been bad actors abusing the label of “private equity investment.”</p>
<p>But private equity is a governance structure, not a business model or industry. As Zeisberger defines it, the format encompasses activities that go by many names — venture capital, growth equity, leveraged buyouts — the list goes on a while, depending on how retro you’d like to get with your jargon.</p>
<p>Despite the various challenges faced by each form of private equity investment, private companies need money now and will need it in the future. And on the other side of the equation, there can be attractive incentives for supplying capital. Ted Eliopoulos, the Chief Investment Officer of CalPERS, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2igan8mFYfc#t=131" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2igan8mFYfc#t=131">summed it up</a> in a 2015 investment committee meeting: “Currently, private equity is the only asset class in our portfolio that is expected to exceed our seven and a half percent target rate of return on a net basis.”</p>
<p>Here are a couple of reasons why there are solid opportunities within the broad category of private equity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing the right opportunities.</strong> Investors in developed markets are used to allocating capital through liquid, well diversified public markets. In China, India, and Japan, the top ten firms represented 18%, 27%, and 17% of the country’s total market capitalization. In Nigeria, Peru, and Columbia, the top ten firms represent 72%, 72%, and 71% of market capitalization. To access the most exciting components of a country’s economic story, an investor will need to go private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repeatable returns.</strong> Alternatives <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/08/18/hedge-fund-fees-the-rorschach-test-of-investing/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/08/18/hedge-fund-fees-the-rorschach-test-of-investing/">are always Rorschach Tests</a> to some degree, and critics will suggest that private equity returns are only repeatable when capital markets provide a source of cheap leverage. But you can’t get leverage without some kind of return stream, and there is evidence that private managers add value. Citing <a href="http://www.capdyn.com/research/value-creation-in-private-equity-june-2014/">a study on value creation from the Center for Entrepreneurial and Financial Studies and Capital Dynamics</a>, Zeisberger noted that operational value creation accounts for almost three quarters of unlevered returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Idiosyncrasies.</strong> It can be hard to analyze investments from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective, especially when considering a massive asset class that spans the earliest to latest stages of a company’s life cycle. But remember: most private equity firms are composed of curious, hardworking people trying to do things differently from their competition. Some will succeed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not all sunshine and carried interest from here on out. The same set of concerns that apply elsewhere in investing — slowing growth, pricey assets, and intensifying competition — accompany private equity. Zeisberger noted that <a href="http://www.collercapital.com/News/2015/Coller-Capital-Winter-Barometer-2015-16.aspx" title="Link: http://www.collercapital.com/News/2015/Coller-Capital-Winter-Barometer-2015-16.aspx">96% of investors surveyed by Coller Capital</a> saw high asset prices as a headwind for private equity prices in the coming three to five years.</p>
<p>Private equity firms can add value to the companies they invest in and engage with, but it won’t be easy or automatic. Despite those hurdles, <a href="https://www.preqin.com/item/2016-preqin-global-private-equity-and-venture-capital-report/1/13358" title="Link: https://www.preqin.com/item/2016-preqin-global-private-equity-and-venture-capital-report/1/13358">88% of investors surveyed by Prequin at the start of 2016</a> expected to commit the same amount of capital or more to private equity this year as they had in the previous year.</p>
<p>Overall, the death of private equity has more in common with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/01/26/the-decades-long-history-of-the-abe-vigoda-death-hoax/" title="Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/01/26/the-decades-long-history-of-the-abe-vigoda-death-hoax/">the long-rumored death of Abe Vigoda</a> than an actual mortality event.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-profit-from-a-crisis"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/09/16/how-to-profit-from-a-crisis/">How to Profit From a Crisis</a></h2>
<p>Everyone is about to lose a lot of money, but do what I say and you won’t!</p>
<p>Somewhere in that sentence is the ultimate pitch. It’s nothing if not a call to adventure, and even better: It offers you the chance to be smarter than the folks next door. For some, it’s just the allure of being right while others are wrong that makes crisis-inflected analysis so compelling.</p>
<p>For others, it’s making money. I probably do not need to remind you of <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120036645057290423">John Paulson’s 2007 payday</a>. No doubt: Make the right call, stick to it, and the rest of your life changes. You’ll be sought out as an oracle amid the crisis, and for sure the people who didn’t listen will write in to say they wish they did.</p>
<p><strong>If you ever find yourself thinking this way, it’s time for a vacation.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not just ripping on the bears here. A creative professional in today’s market will find no shortage of reasons to be legitimately worried about the outlook for risk assets. If you’re following along at home: They also go down.</p>
<p>The word “crisis” is nightmare fuel enough to produce a career’s worth of bad decisions though. With <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=deutsche+lehman+moment&amp;oq=deutsche+lehman+moment&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4014j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#tbm=nws&amp;q=deutsche+lehman">discussion blossoming</a> about whether Deutsche Bank will produce another “Lehman moment,” I figured I could usefully round up some crisis thinking for your examination.</p>
<p>I’ve summarized three books below that each offer its own flavor of apocalyptic investing. One of them I recommend. The hope is that reading over the list will keep you mindful of the sometimes narrow line between thesis and theology.</p>
<p>But first, I’ve got two words for you:</p>
<p><strong>Heirloom Seeds</strong></p>
<p>If you believe a doomsday crisis is around the corner and you are interested in generating robust returns from it, even well-collateralized exchange-traded products might not be the way to go. Heirloom seeds, which are cheap and can be used to create more of themselves, <a href="http://www.offthegridnews.com/survival-gardening-2/20-must-have-seeds-to-store-for-a-crisis/">are your best bet for a store of value</a></p>
<p>Options cost money, and if it’s Deutsche Bank that has you worried, you can only get puts going two years out. You’re better than that.</p>
<p>Create an option to manufacture food amid the wreckage instead. You’ll coast without paying <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/theta.asp">theta</a> for years, and if you happen to buy the seeds on a credit card with a promotional 0% rate, it gets even better: If the world ends before the offer expires, your rate of return is infinite.</p>
<p>If you’re skeptical, consider what the going rate for a fresh heirloom tomato is likely to be after Armageddon. Even if at the end of five years you throw all your seeds out the window in disgust, you might still get a radish out of it a few weeks later.</p>
<p>Try that with a financial instrument. Probably these alpha spouters are outside your mandate, and that’s exactly the point. It’s almost like considerations of crisis don’t have a place in the realm of professional activity.</p>
<p><strong>Only they do.</strong></p>
<p>Not for nothing, when you ask late-career investment professionals what quality they’d like to pass on to the next generation, a very common response is “<a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/cp.v32.n1.2">a sense of financial market history</a>.”</p>
<p>There has been no shortage of financial <a href="https://www.econcrises.org/">scandals, scoundrels, and crises</a> over the years, and knowing what’s happened in the past can help you avoid bad, simplifying assumptions in the future. I’ll never forget the response I got from a trader in 2007 when I asked him to assess the probability Lehman Brothers would stop making a market in some securities my firm owned for clients. “They’ll never do it” he said. “If they did, they’d never get another to underwrite.”</p>
<p>It’s weirdly possible to be both entirely right and completely wrong when handicapping a crisis.</p>
<p>With all that preamble established, let’s look at some books (in reverse chronological order).</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-you-Profit-coming-devaluation/dp/087000073X">How You Can Profit from the Coming Devaluation</a></em>. 1970.</strong> <strong>Harry Browne.</strong></p>
<p>“The lending of demand deposits causes inflation” is the key sentence in this work, which argues Keynesian economic policies lead, by definition, to the debasement of currency. This book came at an important time, as my colleague Ron Rimkus, CFA, puts it, right before <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/03/13/president-nixon-the-man-who-sold-the-world-fiat-money/">President Richard Nixon sold the world fiat money</a> in 1971.</p>
<p>Browne deserves some credit: Inflation did pick up significantly a few years after this was published, amid the so-called “<a href="http://www.federalreservehistory.org/Period/Essay/13">Great Inflation</a>.” Among economists, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/what_caused_the.html">there’s still some debate as to why this period of high peacetime inflation happened</a>. Allan H. Meltzer of the US Federal Reserve somewhat <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/05/03/part2/Meltzer.pdf">vindicated Browne in 2005</a>, arguing that “widespread acceptance of the simple Keynesian model with its implication that monetary and fiscal policy should be coordinated. In practice, that meant that the Federal Reserve financed a large part of the fiscal deficit.”</p>
<p>Browne recommended a combination of cash in dollars (a month’s expenses), converting savings to Swiss francs and placing them overseas, owning $250 or more in silver coins as well as silver bullion through a Swiss bank, and creating your own retreat in an area full of “self-sufficient and individualistic” people for maximum safety.</p>
<p>I’ll leave it to you to research how those recommendations performed.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beat-Millennium-Crash-Financial-Institute/dp/0735201196"><em>Beat the Millennium Crash: How Profit from the Coming Financial Crisis</em></a>. 1999. Jake Bernstein.</strong></p>
<p>With a trader’s sensibility, Bernstein compares the predicament of an investor at the start of the millennium to that of someone in a crowded movie theater just before the audience notices there is a fire. Noting speculative excesses in markets around the world, Bernstein maintains that markets are headed for a fall and the <a href="http://time.com/3645828/y2k-look-back/">Y2K bug</a> is just another reason why they are about to plunge over the cliff.</p>
<p>This is another reminder of how it’s possible to be right and wrong at the same time. Bernstein spends a lot of time analyzing the negative implications of a Y2K crisis, which did not actually happen. But his statement that the top may not happen exactly on 1 January 2000 was perhaps over-hedged. The peak in the S&amp;P 500 came on 24 March 2000.</p>
<p>Bernstein recommended reducing holdings of stocks to about 10% of a portfolio, adding a 20% allocation to precious metals and equivalents, holding 40% in cash, 15% in real estate, and 15% in collectibles. As before, I’ll leave it to you to assess performance, though one imagines Bernstein had a pretty good start to the millennium.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/features/profitfromthecomingrapture/content/index.asp"><em>How to Profit from the Coming Rapture</em></a>. 2008. Steve and Evie Levy.</strong></p>
<p>I’ll initiate the discussion with a “strong buy” rating: This is a classic.</p>
<p>Let me just excerpt the first few sentences of the foreword:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rapture is coming.</p>
<p>The Tribulation, a horrifying nightmare of bloodshed and destruction, will follow.</p>
<p>And that means one thing: investment opportunities!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Levys proceed to lay out a framework for entrepreneurship in a world of unfolding tribulations, where the medium of exchange has shifted to canned tuna and beans. They even create helpful charts, which they invite us to use for our own calculations.</p>
<p><strong>One More Thing</strong></p>
<p>Before moving on to the other recommended reading material, I need to warn you about something: This article contains snark, which carries with it the risk of assuming that our own investment programs are better thought through and documented than those discussed, which were transmitted in full-length books.</p>
<p>Do not make that assumption. The problem with putting an investment thesis in a book is its permanence: <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dow-36-000-Strategy-Profiting/dp/0609806998">Dow 36,000</a></em>, for instance, has not aged well. But the benefit is that the authors have been forced to think about what they’re doing and why they’re doing it with enough precision to communicate that information. <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/2016/05/09/success-analysis-communication/">All of us have something to learn about the communication end of investing</a>.</p>
<p>There are a lot of potential opinions you can have, but defining those you take action on is important. That way you can stick to them. Remember what happened to Harry Browne: His runaway inflation actually materialized, but that happened a few years after the publication of his book. The chart below shows how $100 invested in gold on 31 December 1969 would have performed over the following decade.</p>
<p>So if you’re thinking about doing something unusual in response to a crisis, make sure and ask yourself how long you’ll be able to stick with it.</p>

<h2 id="how-finance-can-build-a-better-world"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/09/08/how-finance-can-build-a-better-world/">How Finance Can Build a Better World</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it in the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>To think about how financial professionals can change the world, think first about how far we’ve come.</p>
<p>I’m fond of reminding readers that it was once a fringe idea to examine accounting information and derive something of value for the investment decision-making process.</p>
<p>We didn’t arrive at modern best practices because a factor model fell out of a tree onto the head of a sleeping investor. The profession of investment management has developed over time through an iterative process where people tried different things, many of which were once considered too far from the mainstream to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>What’s weird today that will seem obvious tomorrow? It’s a great question to ask yourself semi-regularly. There is little to lose from paying attention to the fringes of human knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a lot there.</strong></p>
<p>You can study <a href="http://cser.org/" title="Link: http://cser.org/">existential risk</a>, learn how to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/magenta-is-googles-project-to-make-art-with-artificial-intelligence">teach an algorithm creativity</a>, or maybe just keep it simple and <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/2015/05/06/you-already-invest-with-impact-do-you-do-it-intentionally/" title="Link: https://annual.cfainstitute.org/2015/05/06/you-already-invest-with-impact-do-you-do-it-intentionally/">think about the knock-on effects of the investments you make</a>. Capital is a powerful thing. It would be foolish to ignore the role that your decisions play in the broader world.</p>
<p>Especially when there is so much good to be done. For evidence of that, consider the documentary <a href="http://livingonone.org/livingonone/"><em>Living on One Dollar</em></a>, which records the difficulties that a few Westerners faced trying to live as Guatemalan locals do. One of the more telling bits of the program was when the conversation shifted to a common financial objective among rural Guatemalans: stove ownership.</p>
<p>The wrong thing to take away from that is “Oh, all they need are stoves!” The question worth asking is: “What if they could get a loan?”</p>
<p><strong>Don’t discount the potential of credit access.</strong></p>
<p>Extending credit to underserved communities is one of those easy-to-say, hard-to-do things that is <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/making-money-poor-microfinance-institutions-going-public-creates-controversy">full of controversy</a>. Collecting interest payments from impoverished borrowers is a source of concern that raises challenging questions about the trade-offs between short-term profits and long-term prosperity. Additionally, studies have shown that this kind of activity, broadly described as microlending, is <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20150227163357-iq516" title="Link: http://news.trust.org/item/20150227163357-iq516">not the most effective way to end global poverty</a>.</p>
<p>However, the expansion of credit offered by microlending has had some notable benefits expanding labor options, boosting business size, and helping families manage their budgets. Access to credit has improved the choices available to global consumers earning and spending money, and these options would not have been explored without the work of microfinance pioneers such as <a href="https://eic.cfainstitute.org/speakers/muhammad-yunus/">Muhammad Yunus</a>, the founder of Grameen Bank.</p>
<p>By considering economic incentives from a different perspective, Yunus was able to develop a business model that functioned at the intersection of capitalism and social responsibility. He will elaborate on these themes in his keynote address, “<a href="https://eic.cfainstitute.org/events/keynote-address/">Redesigning Economics to Redesign the World</a>,” at the <a href="https://eic.cfainstitute.org/">2016 European Investment Conference</a>.</p>
<p>How big an influence Yunus’s model and microlending in general will have on alleviating global poverty remains uncertain, but the insight and innovation that motivated their development represent the sort of thinking that can truly make finance a force for good.</p>
<p>We could use more of it.</p>

<h2 id="does-esg-boost-returns"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/09/01/does-esg-boost-returns/">Does ESG Boost Returns?</a></h2>
<p><em>This post summarizes and extends a 19 July 2016 talk that I gave at the <a href="http://usun.state.gov/" title="Link: http://usun.state.gov/">United States Mission to the United Nations</a>. It was written for CFA Institute and first published by the Enterprising Investor. I'm grateful to <a href="http://usun.state.gov/leadership/6949" title="Link: http://usun.state.gov/leadership/6949">Ambassador Sarah Mendelson</a> and the US State Department for the opportunity.</em></p>
<p>Big questions usually come with incomplete answers.</p>
<p>Are you fulfilling your purpose? Is there life on other planets? Do you drink too much coffee? My own answer to the last one is a definite yes, but it would be hard to answer the other two with even a remotely similar degree of confidence.</p>
<p>Sometime between my parents’ generation and my own, the idea that a business could do both well (in a financial sense) and good (in a social sense) has entered the mainstream. Of course, at a general level, that is a bit like saying how great it is to get equity-like returns with bond-like risk: fluffy, sales-y, and skepticism inducing.</p>
<p>But it’s something people say because there is a large and growing body of evidence that it’s for real.</p>
<p>And if you think like a manager for a moment, it should be intuitive why this is. Start with employee engagement and retention: Doesn’t it stand to reason you’ll be better able to tap into the energy of your employees if they feel their work supports a cause they find meaningful? Isn’t it likely that would have at least some bearing on your ability to compete and, indeed, on whether you succeed?</p>
<p><strong>Yes, But . . .</strong> </p>
<p>That intuition is great for managers, but it’s hard for investors to translate into something actionable. We can audit the degree to which a company is “doing good” by examining the information it releases on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, but the path from disclosure to value creation is a murky one.</p>
<p>One straightforward reason for this is that <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/08/03/conflating-esg-disclosures-out-of-need-not-choice/">a lot of the information that exists is not intended for investors</a>. And though there is <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/07/07/esg-a-material-information-advantage/">convincing evidence</a> that good performance on selected <a href="http://www.sasb.org/materiality/sasb-materiality-map/">industry-specific materiality data</a> leads to increased returns, translating those aggregate-level insights into portfolio-appropriate ideas is not a linear process.</p>
<p>With these issues in mind, it seemed natural to ask what readers of <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> thought of how examining these disclosures might yield better returns.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Do you think analyzing ESG factors can boost returns?*</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Do you think analyzing ESG factors can boost returns" src="images/Do-you-think-analyzing-ESG-factors-can-boost-returns.png?resize=640%2C364"/></p>
<p>* Results do not add up to 100% due to rounding.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Though only 7% of the 535 respondents said “of course” and suggested we Google it, the responses are quite consistent with my own belief that the investment profession sees at least the seed of alpha generation within ESG disclosures.</p>
<p>This is a question quite distinct from one we’ve asked much more rigorously in the recent past: <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/ethics/Documents/issues_esg_investing.pdf">Do you take ESG issues into account?</a> Of CFA Institute members, 73% say they do, mostly because they view the analysis as a way to manage investment risks or because their clients demand it.</p>
<p>The plurality of respondents (37%) said something quite different: that these factors enter into any complete analysis.</p>
<p>CFA Institute agrees, and that’s why this year everyone who sits the Level I exam will find an <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/rr.v2016.n1">added reading on ESG in addition to many others</a>. It’s on the test because it matters: Imagine a company that fits your investment criteria but has a board packed with the CEO’s cousins. Or maybe revenue is growing much faster than costs, but the company releases no information about <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/08/15/the-cost-of-cheap/">how it sources its materials</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why would you ignore that?</strong></p>
<p>I picked extreme examples for the sake of brevity, but they’re not impossible. And it’s hard enough to <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/books/Pages/investment_idea_generation_guide.aspx?WPID=BrowseProducts">generate investment ideas</a>, so it makes sense that nearly a quarter of respondents pay attention to this data by default. A further 16% of respondents gave the quite reasonable answer that their level of attention depends, since the information can be low quality or priced in.</p>
<p>This is true of information in general.</p>
<p>Another 15% of poll participants likely think that writing this up was a waste of time, that ESG material consists of nonfinancial information, which for such a cohort qualifies as non-important.</p>
<p>So I’d like to close by sharing some additional evidence that there is a link between strong performance on ESG factors and what investors care about by definition: generating cash from business activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2699610">more than 2,200 studies reviewed by Gunnar Friede, Timo Busch, and Alexander Bassen</a> show a positive association between ESG factors and corporate financial performance.</li>
<li>Of the <a href="http://www.longfinance.net/programmes/london-accord/la-reports.html?view=report&amp;id=464">studies reviewed by Gordon Clark, Andreas Feiner, and Michael Viehs</a>, 88% demonstrated that companies with robust sustainability practices had better operational performance, which translates into cash flow.</li>
<li>An excellent 2012 study by Mark Fulton, Bruce M. Kahn, and Camilla Sharples states “We were surprised by the clarity of the results we uncovered.” <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2222740">All of the 100-plus studies they reviewed</a> found that companies with high ratings for corporate social responsibility have a lower cost of capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those studies say other things too, and are well worth a read. But those excerpts should give a good sense that there is at least the outline of an alpha opportunity to be had by looking at ESG data.</p>
<p>But translating that opportunity into performance is difficult. Just take it from someone who’s done it: David Blood, a founder of Generation Investment Management, notes that he is reluctant to talk about performance “<a href="http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3486105/asset-management-hedge-funds-and-alternatives/david-blood-and-al-gore-want-to-reach-the-next-generation.html">In some respects because [he is] suspicious</a>.” And it’s appropriate for you to hold that same suspicion.</p>
<p>It might be worth examining your suspicion more closely if this passage from a <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/sustainableinvesting/pdf/sustainable-reality.pdf">2015 Morgan Stanley report on sustainable investing</a> has no effect on it (emphasis theirs).</p>
<p>“We reviewed a range of studies on sustainable investment performance and examined performance data for 10,228 open-end mutual funds and 2,874 Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) based in the United States and denominated in US dollars. In the scope of our review, we ultimately found that <strong>investing in sustainability has usually met, and often exceeded, the performance of comparable traditional investments. This is on both an absolute and a risk-adjusted basis, across asset classes and over time.</strong>“</p>
<p>That’s not the end of the discussion, but it does move it along. To me, it means that there is room to consider a sustainable approach to investing alongside value investing or statistical arbitrage as a tool that a professional investor can use to generate alpha.</p>
<p>Whether you go out and do it is up to you. <a href="https://cfainstitute.org/learning/future/knowledge/pages/esg.aspx">If you’d like to, CFA Institute has plenty of information to help</a>.</p>
