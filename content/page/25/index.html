<h2 id="think-different-but-be-right"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/05/13/think-different-but-be-right/">Think Different, But Be Right</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>Here’s a crazy idea: If you want to perform better than everyone else, start by doing something different from them.</p>
<p>This should be intuitive, but it’s not exactly easy. If clients are asking what you’ve done for them lately and your competitors are turning in great performances, it takes serious fortitude to stick to your special difference.</p>
<p>But the promise of such a strategy is significant, according to <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/rupal-j-bhansali/" title="Link: https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/rupal-j-bhansali/">Rupal J. Bhansali</a>, executive vice president and chief investment officer for global equities at Ariel Investments. While she says implementing such a process promises a stroll down the “path of most resistance,” I would be a little bit disappointed if that turned you off to the approach.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is simple: If you’re a professional investor, your job is to turn effort into alpha.</p>
<p>So you better work.</p>
<p>But there are things you can do to make your life easier. For starters, don’t waste time on looking into businesses that don’t meet one of your core criteria. Bhansali uses a process of elimination, screening out companies with unattractive characteristics so that an attractive opportunity set “rises to the top like cream over milk.”</p>
<p>Bhansali works to avoid investments that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are only optically cheap. This makes sense. As Bhansali says, “Markets don’t reward trading on information that everybody else has,” and headline metrics like P/E ratio are the poster children for information that everyone else has access to. Instead, derive a solid estimate for value based on the business itself.</li>
<li>Employ creative accounting. This doesn’t mean fraud. Bhansali focuses on avoiding “accounting chicanery,” which boils down to a business getting ahead of itself in its financial statements.</li>
<li>Derive returns from a low-quality business. We’ve all seen companies that are making money through a byzantine mix of macro tailwinds, cheap leverage, and dumb luck. Life is too short to try and make money there. As Bhansali says, “low quality businesses will compound your problems, not your returns.”</li>
<li>Have a weak balance sheet. Why take the risk? “Don’t forget, we are equity investors,” Bhansali says. “We are at the bottom of the cap structure. We have an option value in the business only if there’s something left over. If there’s nothing left over and debt holders claim a lot of the value of the company, then that option is worthless.”</li>
<li>Are likely to revert to the mean. Lots of businesses are cyclical, and at the top of the cycle there is always a hope that they’ve managed to change their fundamental nature.</li>
<li>Mules do not change into thoroughbreds. Channeling Henry Kissinger, Bhansali notes that “hope is not a strategy.”</li>
<li>Are about to be disrupted. Ignoring the competitive threat from a new potential entrant is a bit like hoping for a return to the flat world. Bhansali reminds us that “Amazon nixed brick and mortar. Shale fracking broke the nexus between oil and gas.” Don’t be casual about the risk that the world changes and leaves your favorite investment in the dust.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>All of this is great advice, and the sort of thing that you might expect to hear about from a CFA Institute staffer. I like to think folks would be a little weirded out if we were suggesting paying attention to only headline P/E multiples and investing in companies that were about to be disrupted.</p>
<p>The crux of pulling off this process is the contrarian bit. As Bhansali notes, there is no payoff in seeing something that everybody else saw too. So instead, look for situations where the “bad news is priced in, but the good news is not.” This is easier said than done. Not only is it a hard problem for you, the analyst, to actually come up with a set of compelling ideas, it’s tough to get your clients to stick with you long enough to find out that your research was good.</p>
<p>On this, Bhansali had a really useful suggestion: “You need to tell people that what you are serving is fine dining, not fast food.” Remind them not to measure your performance after five minutes, since the meal won’t even be cooked yet.</p>
<p>And while you’re at it, you might remind them that eating nothing but fast food is a terrible long-term strategy.</p>

<p>If you’re on social media just trying to get famous, stop.</p>
<p>Many investment professionals are naturally competitive people, myself included. Accustomed to being benchmarked and trained to quantify impact, we run an unusual risk of thinking that social media is a contest.</p>
<p>But applying that perspective is counterproductive. It’s a bit like going to a dinner party and trying to keep score. People might be into it if you have strange friends, but there’s a better chance that you will alienate everyone there.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>During a panel conversation, “How Social Media Is Changing Financial Services (and How to Adapt),” at the <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/">69th CFA Institute Annual Conference</a>, <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/marissa-pick/">Marissa Pick</a>, director of social media at CFA Institute; <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/michael-batnick-cfa/">Michael Batnick, CFA,</a> director of research at <a href="http://www.ritholtzwealth.com/">Ritholtz Wealth Management</a>; and <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/tadas-viskanta/">Tadas Viskanta</a>, founder and editor of <em><a href="http://abnormalreturns.com/">Abnormal Returns</a></em>, gave their perspectives on social media’s value proposition and how to best leverage the technology. It turns out it’s not rocket science.</p>
<p><strong>Show Up Looking to Learn</strong></p>
<p>Only 29% of respondents to an audience poll said that they use social media as part of their research process. That came as a surprise. Social media can be a critical information-gathering tool. Research from MIT Sloan indicates that <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-twitter-users-can-generate-better-ideas/">users who follow a diverse network of experts on Twitter come up with measurably better ideas</a>.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that starting a Twitter account is a magic bullet. Following a given Kardashian won’t do much for you, and the behaviors discussed in the paper are good ideas in general: Pay attention to a wide range of informed views.</p>
<p>And I don’t mean views on which direction stocks are going to move. Both Viskanta and Batnick agreed that reading forecasts and stock picks is the least interesting part of using Twitter. There are plenty of other things to share! For instance, <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1970/01/00/hedge_fund/pdf.html">here’s an article</a> Batnick highlighted detailing the struggles of the hedge fund industry . . . in 1969.</p>
<p>Isn’t that more interesting than 140 characters about somebody’s favorite trade? One of the things that is hard to understand for people who are new to social media is that it’s important to always keep your audience in mind. A given trade recommendation will only be compelling to a small number of people who share your time frame and investment beliefs. Information is much more interesting than recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>But Don’t Forget Conversations!</strong></p>
<p>Viskanta also made an important point: Social media is certainly a broadcast medium, but it is more than just that. Remember the analogy about the dinner party? It’s considered bad manners to remain completely silent during dinner, and for good reason: It’s kind of a weird thing to do.</p>
<p>Part of the magic of social media, Viskanta noted, is that it really is a conversation. This is a truism that cynics often ignore. There are lots of silly things being said about social media. Look no further than AOL’s  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_AODNLJDEI">“Digital Prophet” Shingy</a>. And though <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/17/crystal-ball-3">it’s fun to read</a> about an over-the-top evangelist of a trend you don’t understand and dismiss it, it is far from productive.</p>
<p>Instead, think about what it means that these tools exist. At minimum, it means that you can ask that question that popped into your head. It also means that you probably should. When you respond on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, whatever, it may feel like you are responding to words. But really you are responding to a person. People react well when you respond thoughtfully to something that they wrote or said. I know it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.</p>
<p>But a lot can come from a conversation, so it’s worth remembering that you can do more with your interaction than just make someone feel good. For instance, Viskanta played a big role in my own professional development just by doing his thing. In the early days of my investment career, I relied immensely on his curation to get a handle on who and what was interesting. And years later, I was able to tell him that to his face over dinner.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn’t know that until I told him, and there was a 9- or 10-year lag between when I started reading <em>Abnormal Returns</em> and when I was finally able to thank Tadas in person for the early career solid he did for me. Over that time, he’s evolved his offering considerably, but he’s stayed consistent and true to himself.</p>
<p><strong>If You Do One Thing, Make It That</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the platform or platform combination that you choose to adopt or the content that you choose to engage with, it bears repeating that you won’t create much value for yourself if you’re not doing something you actually find valuable. There is no sense trying to score internet points by getting LinkedIn likes or Twitter hearts. Concentrate instead on trying to learn things from others that will elevate your ability to serve your clients.</p>
<p>Batnick <a href="https://twitter.com/willortel/status/729373648566419457">recommended</a> a few Twitter accounts to follow, and I agree with all of his recommendations. Simply going in and reading a few tweets from each of these handles is a good start. Keeping up with <a href="http://abnormalreturns.com/" title="Link: http://abnormalreturns.com/">Viskanta’s work</a> is also a great way to see longer-form commentary from all kinds of different sources to get a better sense of what most interests you.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools and plenty of social networks, but if you’re just getting started and primarily looking to learn, there really is nowhere better than Twitter. It may be ironic that a network that emphasizes brevity and immediacy has evolved into tremendously useful tool for long-term investors. But that doesn’t make it untrue.</p>

<p><em>This was written for (and first published by) CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>If you want to test yourself as an analyst, decide that technology is going to change the investment business, and then set out to understand exactly how.</p>
<p>There are a number of trends that cross over from technology. AirBnB, now effectively one of the world’s largest hotels, owns none of the real estate it offers. Uber has gained immense market share by streamlining the annoying process of getting a cab… and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/16/uber-worlds-biggest-ride-sharing-company-no-drivers">by the way, they don’t employ any drivers</a>.</p>
<p>Will the investment services of the future use no money? It’s not a crazy question. Some of the highest profile financial technology companies operate on precisely that premise. So-called “marketplace” lenders, like Lending Club and On Deck Capital, aim to bring suppliers and consumers of capital together on the same platform, set appropriate interest rates based on risk, and service the loans throughout their lives.</p>
<p>These companies have grown immensely, but to critics they still have a lot to prove. Today <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/lc">Lending Club</a> and <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ondk">On Deck Capital</a> change hands for less than 35% of their IPO prices, and there is a reason for that. The institutional investors who were funding the loans made by these platforms have gotten less enthusiastic about supplying capital. And that means the lenders’ business models will need to evolve. As Fitch Ratings puts it, the firms are confronting “<a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/site/fitch-home/pressrelease?id=1002352">market realities</a>.”</p>
<p>Optimism was once at a fever pitch. About eighteen months ago, I spoke with four different funds in a single week who all had more than a quarter of their portfolios invested in Lending Club loans. This was surprising, since they were as different as one could imagine, and hadn’t done much else in credit until finding the platform. But it was easy to use, and offered them an exposure that was hard to find elsewhere without going through scores of intermediaries.</p>
<p>So we have two realities that apply to the same companies: passionate users with good reasons to like the product, and stock charts that go from top left to bottom right. What the heck is going on? Should we be worried about the future of this category?</p>
<p><a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/ashby-monk/">Ashby Monk</a>, executive and research director of the Stanford Global Projects Center, considered this question a few weeks ago in <em>Institutional Investor</em>. His answer: “<a href="http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/blogarticle/3544456/peer-pressure-p2p-lending-poised-to-shake-up-credit/banking-and-capital-markets-banking.html">Nah</a>.” The thinking is that what we’re seeing is really growing pains as marketplace lenders evolve to find more stable pools of capital to support themselves. As many have learned over time, counting on continued favor from the hedge fund community is a great way to be disappointed.</p>
<p>In contrast, large institutional investors can be slow slow to embrace change, but think in decades and centuries. They are also continuously looking to deploy capital and increasingly attentive to the fees their intermediaries feast upon.</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that pension funds looking to invest in loans would seek out ways to invest in them directly. The experience of the firms that have come to market so far may not actually tell us much about the validity of that premise, since a sufficiently large fund might even set up their (fully vertically integrated) program with its own constraints and objectives. Success then becomes somewhat personal, and difficult to judge from the comfort of your keyboard.</p>
<p>It’s not without irony that this version of the financial future is rather apart from the one brought to us by Uber and AirBNB. For one thing, what we are contemplating is a world where technology services employ a tremendous amount of their own capital. For another, this is just one possible future.</p>

<h2 id="maximizing-your-philanthropic-impact"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/04/20/maximizing-your-philanthropic-impact/">Maximizing Your Philanthropic Impact</a></h2>
<p>When you read up on philanthropy, you hear one word an awful lot: impact.</p>
<p>Obviously that makes sense. If you just want to make someone’s life better, buy me a Jet Ski. If you want to have as big a positive impact on the world as possible, you are starting down an interesting, under-traveled, and complicated road.</p>
<p>There is a spectrum of causes you can support, ranging from the sublime and spiritual to the frivolous. You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad/description" title="Link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad/description">help a guy make potato salad</a>, <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">support a local museum</a>, or <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">save somebody’s life</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, one of these things is not like the other. And that should serve to clarify the stakes. But even charities with the same objectives can differ widely in terms of their effectiveness. Last month, Eric Friedman, CFA, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/03/15/a-greater-misuse-of-charitable-donations-than-fraud/">made the point</a> that some charities can make life-saving interventions for a fraction of the cost of other organizations.</p>
<p>So, by using the right approach, you can save more than 600 lives for the cost of one. Conservatively.</p>
<p>That sort of gap in performance denotes opportunity for investors, both in optimizing personal giving and in helping clients achieve the same efficiency. Friedman and I connected over email to take the discussion a bit further, but certainly the hope is that it does not end here. We would both appreciate it if you would share your own questions in the comments section below.</p>
<p><strong>Will Ortel: One of the most influential concepts in investing is the idea of “efficient” markets, which basically states that it is difficult to beat the market because the best investment opportunities are spotted quickly and buyers bid up the price to fair value. Does this same principle apply in charitable giving?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eric Friedman, CFA:</strong> Somewhat, but not as much as in investments. A lot of donor money goes to the nonprofits that are best at fundraising, not necessarily those with the best programs.</p>
<p>Fundraising success is more correlated with being able to tell compelling stories rather than being charities with evidence-based programs demonstrated to have a strong impact. Further, donors often constrain their giving to areas that they relate to, so causes that are not personally appealing to upper-middle-class and wealthy donors tend to be neglected.</p>
<p>As a result, there are broad swaths of extremely effective charities that have huge funding gaps.</p>
<p>There are some very savvy donors trying to close these gaps, but they are small relative to the total amounts donated. For example, grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is one of the most sophisticated donors and <a href="http://foundationcenter.org/findfunders/topfunders/top100assets.html">the largest foundation by far</a>, are only about 1% of the size of <a href="http://givingusa.org/">what Americans donate annually</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investors frequently complain about not having access to enough information in making investment decisions. The same complaint is probably relevant for charities, but can you compare the information that decision makers use in both contexts?</strong></p>
<p>A key difference between information available to investors and donors is that the regulatory environment for information-sharing is much stricter for investments. For example, mutual funds have to disclose many things about their strategies, and their marketing material is tightly controlled to minimize their ability to over-promise or mislead. Investment firms typically can’t highlight a single winning position without disclosing their whole portfolio performance.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said about charities. While that might make donors cautious, there are also reasons to be more optimistic about the quality of information available.</p>
<p>In the for-profit sector, participants protect their trade secrets and competitive advantages. In contrast, participants in the not-for-profit sector have aligned interests — making the world better — so there is greater potential for sharing information.</p>
<p>In both investing and donating, there are experts who are professionally skilled at identifying the best places to allocate capital. One of the biggest differences is that in the investment world, those experts often guard that information as trade secrets, while experts in the charitable sector more frequently share it publicly.</p>
<p><strong>We are all familiar with portfolios where risk and return are balanced. Can the idea of optimizing risk and return be applied to charitable giving?</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important questions when considering a giving opportunity is the level of evidence that it will be effective. This can be thought of as tied to the level of risk. Some interventions have a lot of evidence, sometimes even being tested with similar scientific practices to what pharmaceutical companies are required to use to get new medicines approved. Other giving opportunities are not conducive to such hard evidence, such as with policy advocacy or research.</p>
<p>As with investing, the lowest risk approach isn’t necessarily the best, but taking risk is only desirable if it has the possibility for an outsized return — or impact.</p>
<p>Charitable giving doesn’t have a quantitative “efficient frontier” in the same sense as exists in investing, but risk and return are still important ideas.</p>
<p><strong>If I give without using this framework or a similar one, what are the risks?</strong></p>
<p>In the investing world, an adviser who is unconcerned about risk and return would undoubtedly be breaching fiduciary duties. With charitable giving, if you’re not focused on the evidence behind your approach and the potential outcomes, then you’re flying blind with respect to impact.</p>
<p><strong>The impact of a charity is fundamentally tricky to understand. Can you talk about that?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes donors only take a surface look at the evidence for impact, which can lead them in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>For example, many people who want to support education donate to college scholarships without thinking through how much the scholarships actually increase education versus facilitate people graduating with less debt.</p>
<p>Or worse, scholarships may enable universities to get away without controlling costs. It isn’t clear without a fairly deep understanding of the dynamics, but it is very possible that the impact of this type of donation is less than a donor might initially expect.</p>
<p>In contrast, giving to some causes might be greater than what one might assume on initial consideration. For example, research indicates that treating parasitic intestinal worms in developing world countries actually increases educational and economic outcomes in addition to health, possibly by the flow-through effects of improved nutrition.</p>
<p>This is an important reason why using intuition alone is often not a good strategy to maximize charitable impact.</p>
<p><strong>How does this compare to some of the key ways donors have historically evaluated charities?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of donors emphasize financial efficiency, such as evaluating charities based on the percentage they spend on overhead. The problem is that there can be very lean organizations that are not especially effective. In fact, “overhead” costs can often be critical for the success of a nonprofit, such as program evaluations and competitive salaries for quality staff.</p>
<p>To create an analogy to the investing world, don’t you want the companies you invest in to spend money on marketing, R&amp;D, and technology? Similarly, a certain level of overhead is critical for charities.</p>
<p>Of course, donors can rest assured that a wasteful organization is unlikely to have a high impact by any legitimate measure. I think the nonprofit community as a whole now recognizes that it is better to evaluate the program impact of a charity. This is a more difficult task than computing a few ratios from a charity’s IRS filings, but well worth the added effort.</p>
<p><strong>Many advisers shy away from talking about charitable giving with their clients because they view it as too complex or not their specialty. Is there something that simplifies the research process and gives donors access to a broadly diversified, rigorously constructed basket of charities?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. There are several charity evaluators that do very robust research and share their results publicly. The really good ones only give their top ratings to a handful of the most deserving charities.</p>
<p>The group I work with, <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a>, aggregates research from several reliable sources to provide a broader list of recommendations than any one source individually. Importantly, we try hard to present the information in a way that is easy to digest for both financial advisers and donors.</p>

<p>I bet you’ve been thinking about China more often than usual over the past few months.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>Why focus there? The Shanghai Composite sits right around 3,000 today, which is quite a long way down from the 5,000 it was at three quarters ago. There are big questions to ponder. Think like a Chinese policymaker. With a slowing domestic economy and significant evidence of capital flight, do you focus on a <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/03/22/chinas-dilemma-stabilize-monetary-policy-or-the-renminbi/">stable currency or a stable monetary policy</a>?</p>
<p>That question has, to put it mildly, some implications for the investment community.</p>
<p>It’s also helpful to note that, on at least one quantitative basis, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/03/08/robert-engle-on-systemic-risk-in-china-and-around-the-world/">systemic risk in China is the highest of any country in the world</a>. That’s not much of a surprise to those who are paying attention. More than half of the <em><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/14/how-poorly-will-chinas-economy-perform-in-2016/">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/14/how-poorly-will-chinas-economy-perform-in-2016/">who we polled</a> think that the economy will turn in less than 6% growth this year.</p>
<p>Investors looking for additional context have been studying the most recent <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/02/03/what-makes-chinas-corporate-bond-market-different/">report to the National People’s Congress (NPC)</a>, but it is also helpful to examine the fundamental differences that China has in terms of market structure. Some things do not look at all like they do elsewhere. For instance, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/02/03/what-makes-chinas-corporate-bond-market-different/">credit analysis requires an investor to be, to some degree, an analyst of state policy</a>.</p>
<p>I was eager to get some perspective on what’s happening and what to expect, so I enlisted the help of Gordon Chang, a <a href="http://www.gordonchang.com/article.htm">peripatetic and knowledgeable observer of the region</a> and a <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/07/02/is-china-coming-off-the-rails/">return guest to the <em>Enterprising Investor</em></a>. Chang is the author of <a href="http://www.gordonchang.com/books.htm">two books</a> and also writes for <em><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/#7116599136a6">Forbes</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/users/gordon-g-chang">World Affairs</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese Equity Markets Have Grown Meaningfully in Market Capitalization</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Markets.png"><img alt="Chinese Equity Markets have Grown Meaningfully" src="images/Markets.png?resize=640%2C301"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Enterprising Investor: Looking just at the growth of China’s market capitalization, it’s an impressive track record. How would the Communist Party of China like us to see this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gordon Chang:</strong> They’d like you to look at the market as really being modern. Really as a rival to New York, and in some ways it is. For instance, before the collapse of the Chinese stock market last year, the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-08/china-just-killed-the-world-s-biggest-stock-index-futures-market">Chinese stock index futures market was the largest in the world</a>. The volume there is very, very big.</p>
<p>The problem is that although you have a lot of money sloshing around China, those markets are not modern. We saw that as the Communist Party tried to rescue stock prices beginning the first week of July. They directly intervened. They criminalized a lot of forms of trading. They prevented the institutions from selling. They directly bought up stock through the so-called “<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/27/chinas-national-team-stock-market-ownership.html">National Team</a>.”</p>
<p>Despite the fact that these stock markets are now about 25 years old, they really haven’t reformed very much. There’s been relatively little progress because the government right now is just dominating the markets. China no longer has functioning equity markets.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>As GDP Growth Slows</strong>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/GDP.png"><img alt="But GDP Growth is Slowing" src="images/GDP.png?resize=640%2C321"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>We’ve all been told not to trust China’s GDP figures. Can you take us inside the statistics a little bit?</strong></p>
<p>The National Bureau of Statistics reported 6.9% growth for 2015, but very few people now actually believe that. There’s a consensus forming around 4.0%. For instance, you have the Conference Board reporting 3.7% growth for last year.</p>
<p>Capital Economics in London is saying 4.3%. Although, you can make a case for 1% or 2%, especially when you look at electricity consumption, which is still by far the most reliable indicator of Chinese economic activity, and when you look at price data. For instance, for last year, when they were reporting 6.9% real, they were also reporting 6.4% nominal.</p>
<p>China’s officially in deflationary territory. Q4 was really ugly, because Q4, nominal was 5.8% and real was 6.8%. This is a situation going downward. It doesn’t really matter what China’s growth rate is, whether it’s 6.9% or 1%. The point right now is that Chinese leaders cannot change the downward trajectory. China’s growth has been slowing fast. It’s going to continue to do that.</p>
<p>Eventually, it’s going to go into contraction, and that’s a problem because China has accumulated all this debt in order to create growth. In some way, it’s got to pay this debt back. In one way or another, it’s got to retire these obligations. This means that China’s headed towards a debt crisis.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>While Debt Grows Meaningfully</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Govt-debt.png"><img alt="While Debt Grows Meaningfully" src="images/Govt-debt.png?resize=640%2C293"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>It sounds great, 50% year-on-year growth, until you realize we’re measuring debt. And again, that’s just as reported by the government, which we’re taught to suspect fudges numbers from time to time. What could the true number be?</strong></p>
<p>Their debt, we don’t really know what it is. For instance, McKinsey Global Institute said, in the middle of 2014, that it was 282% debt to GDP. Soros, in Davos in January, said 350%. Some people are talking 400%, which I think is actually closer to the mark.</p>
<p>This is not a good story. There’s an enormous amount of debt out there. A lot has been stuffed away in corners. We don’t have a really good view of what it is. When you combine that with stalling growth, it means that there’s got to be an adjustment, and that adjustment’s probably going to look like 1929.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Are Domestic Borrowers Preparing for a Devaluation?</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/fx-loans.png"><img alt="fx Are Borrowers Getting Ready For a Devaluation" src="images/fx-loans.png?resize=640%2C302"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>It seems like Chinese borrowers are maybe anticipating a currency move. If they were caught offsides with renminbi revenues and dollar debts, that would be really bad. Is that what’s going on here?</strong></p>
<p>Last year, there was $1 trillion of net capital outflow, according to Bloomberg. Other people say a little bit less. A large part of that net capital outflow were Chinese borrowers switching out of US dollar debt into renminbi debt, because they are concerned about the exposure. They don’t want to get caught on the wrong side of a declining renminbi, which is actually happening right now.</p>
<p>Of course, the central bank is trying to support it, but eventually they’re going to have to relent. They will have to capitulate. When they capitulate, it’s going to probably be at the last moment, because they’re going to hold on for as long as they can do so. When they can no longer do so, we’re going to see a run out of this currency.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Trading Volumes and Margin Balances Have Dropped Appreciably</strong>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Trading-volume.png"><img alt="Something Changed Recently" src="images/Trading-volume.png?resize=640%2C269"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What’s going on with the plummeting volume and margin balances?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you’ve got to remember that one thing that’s happened since the first week of July, and that is the central government, through various state entities — the so‑called National Team — has been buying up stock. When the National Team buys out stock, it doesn’t trade them, so you’re going to have declining volume.</p>
<p>Also, this is a partial re-nationalization of state enterprises, so this is bad on two counts. That’s why you have volume declining. One thing that’s fascinating: Bloomberg reported that volume of the stock index futures market — which was the world’s largest prior to the mid‑June collapse — volume in the July-August-September time frame declined 99%.</p>
<p>This is an indication of how tough the central government has been, how determined it’s been to support stock prices. They’re going to do everything they possibly can to prevent the market values from tanking, but when they do that, they’re killing volume, and China no longer has a functioning stock market right now. It just doesn’t. It’s the government playing.</p>
<p>What we see in terms of changes in the Shanghai Composite, when they go up, it’s mostly the government. When they go down, it’s when the government isn’t looking.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Zooming Out, You Wonder: What Currency Volatility?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/rmb.png"><img alt="It Cant Just Be the Currency" src="images/rmb.png?resize=640%2C278"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The renminbi is this big specter that looms over any thought an investor might have regarding China. Recent currency moves have not been that big, if you look at them on a long time horizon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There has been talk about further devaluation, but what range of values are we really talking about here?</strong></p>
<p>The central bank has said that they’re not going to have a big one-time devaluation, which might make sense. They will continue to support it until they no longer have dollars and foreign currency to do so, which means that when it adjusts, it’s going to adjust sharp. It’s going to be sudden, and there’s no bottom to this market.</p>
<p>They will hold on until the very last moment. They can prevent large downward movements to the renminbi, but they really cannot, I think, do this for that much longer. There’s too much money coming out of the country.</p>
<p>One of the things that’s even worse: There was, in February, a much smaller decline in the foreign exchange reserves compared to January, when it was $99.5 billion. It declined to under $30, about $28 billion in February. That’s because basically no one’s allowed to remit money out of the country. Or, if they do so, it’s under very tight circumstances.</p>
<p>China’s essentially re-imposed very strict capital controls. A lot of these controls are off the books, so they’re not official. This works for a little while, but the problem is: Who’s going to put their money into a country when they may not be able to get it out?</p>
<p>The issue for China is going to be inward flows. Eventually those inward flows will stop, because of what they’re doing to prevent the outward flows.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Forex Reserves Seem to Have Been Spent to Support the Currency</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Forex-reserves.png"><img alt="ForEx Reserves are Being Spent to Support It" src="images/Forex-reserves.png?resize=640%2C296"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>But Are They Just Replacing Outward Capital Flows?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Capital-Flows.png"><img alt="Seemingly Directly Replacing Outward Capital Flows" src="images/Capital-Flows.png?resize=640%2C289"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>The reported declines in foreign exchange reserves I think have been minimized. They give us a number. We can back check it, but it’s hard to do that.</p>
<p>Also, the one thing they’ve been doing is they’ve been engaging in forward transactions to hide the decline in the foreign reserves. They’re going with these derivatives. This is what Brazil did in 2013. It never ends well. Yes, China has a lot of firepower, but it’s declining fast.</p>
<p>Also, some of the funds in the reserves may not be liquid, so, therefore, they may not be available for defense of the currency. There’s a big black box there, and the global financial community just relies on the numbers that China has been giving us. I don’t know if we can actually do that.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Chaos Is Becoming Consensus</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/consensus.png"><img alt="Chaos is Becoming The Consensus" src="images/consensus.png?resize=640%2C250"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>This is definitely news. We were joking at the beginning of this. We titled our last conversation, “Is China Going Off the Rails?” At the time, that was not a question many were asking.</strong> <strong>Recently <em>The New York Times</em> ran a headline saying the answer was yes: “A New Economic Era for China as They Go Off the Rails.” Are enough people talking enough about this? Are too many?</strong></p>
<p>I think that the global financial community understands that there are real problems in China, and they didn’t understand this, let’s say, eight or nine months ago.</p>
<p>For instance, you go back to August of 2015. You have relatively unimportant news coming out of the Chinese manufacturing sector causing big drops in equity markets in Asia, Europe, and the United States. For instance, we had six days in August when we lost $2.1 trillion in value because of inconsequential things happening in China.</p>
<p>Now, when you have bad news out of China, it doesn’t necessarily affect global markets. I think we’re becoming inured to that. Also, I think the global financial community, although it understands there are problems there, I don’t think they understand the dimension of the problems.</p>
<p>They see the Chinese government sort of rescuing things, but they don’t really look behind how that’s occurring and the sustainability of Beijing’s moves. Beijing’s moves: They can do this for a year or two, but the problem is that as they prevent the adjustment, the underlying imbalances are becoming bigger.</p>
<p>As the underlying imbalances become bigger, the inevitable adjustment has to be severe. Chinese leaders are continuing to do this stuff until they no longer have the ability to do that. When they no longer have the ability to do it, their economy will go into free fall. I don’t think the global financial community understands that.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>China Seems to Be Moving from One Sort of Outlier to Another</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/age-dependency.png"><img alt="Is This a Transition from One Sort of Outlier to Another" src="images/age-dependency.png?resize=640%2C341"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How much of this is just demographics?</strong>
**
At the moment, they have a massive working-age population supporting a relatively small number of retirees, but World Bank estimates have us right at the inflection point where it heads the other way. By 2050, China will have more retirees than the rest of the world and perhaps a less dynamic population and economy, by extension.**</p>
<p>**A view that’s forming is that really this is the beginning of the end for them. Is it the case that there are a couple of reforms that they can enact, burn off some bad debt, and get back to business, or are we witnessing a structural decline?
**
There are structural economic reforms that if they were implemented could save China, but the problem is that those reforms are not possible within the context of the political system that China’s president, Xi Jinping, will not change. The answer is that we’re not going to see the reforms that are necessary.</p>
<p>Indeed, at Premier Li Keqiang’s work report at the ongoing National People’s Congress meeting, it’s clear that they’re prioritizing growth over reform. They’ve basically given up on reform. Yes, they talk about it, but they’re not implementing it.</p>
<p>That means that what we’re seeing is essentially a long, slow decline. Without reform, they aren’t going to be able to make the changes that are absolutely necessary. There’s just no political will to do that.</p>
<p>In fact, if we look at the changes in the economy since Xi Jinping became China’s general party secretary in November 2012, he’s taken China backwards. He’s recombining already large-state enterprises back into monopolies.</p>
<p>We’re seeing the partial re-nationalization of the Chinese economy as more and more state ownership of state enterprises. More state money going to favored market participants. Foreign companies are losing market share, because they’re being attacked by the state.</p>
<p>These are all things that are regressive, so Deng Xiaoping’s policy of reform and opening up is over. We’re going back to a Maoist-inspired economy. That may sound a little harsh, but indeed what Xi Jinping is doing is very reminiscent of what we saw in the 1950s. This is a bad story for China.</p>
<p>Yes, they can stave off problems while they have more and more state control, but eventually this whole thing just fails, as it did before.</p>
<p>**You say the recipe is similar to Mao’s in terms of centralizing control. What are some other major points of concordance between what Xi Jinping has been doing and the 1950s period in China?
**</p>
<p>When we look at it, I think the most telling thing is the re-creation of state monopolies, which is absolutely the wrong way to go. China created growth in the 1990s when they went the other way, when they were breaking up state monopolies, allowing state enterprises to compete with each other.</p>
<p>Now, we’re about a year and a half, two years into a reversal process. That means there’s more and more of these recombinations. That means less and less competition. That can’t be good for the competitiveness of these enterprises except for competitiveness at home.</p>
<p>Of course, the bigger they get with no competitors, yes, they will be able to maximize profits. Only in China, though. Around the world, they’re going to get beaten, because they are losing those qualities of competitiveness that are absolutely necessary to compete in global markets.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Growth in Energy Consumption Has Stalled</strong>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Electricity-consumption.png"><img alt="Slowing Growth in Electricity Usage" src="images/Electricity-consumption.png?resize=640%2C291"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Analysts love to look at electricity usage in China, under a theory that you can’t really trust GDP that much.</strong></p>
<p>For 2015, electricity consumption increased by 0.5%. Generally speaking, GDP growth has been about 85% of the growth of electricity. We’re talking a pretty low GDP number.</p>
<p>Of course, electricity’s only one indicator, but there are others that corroborate, essentially, a no‑growth environment. If we go back to the last downturn at the end of the 1990s, a lot of people were saying electricity was no longer so indicative. Afterwards, after that downturn passed, people went back and realized electricity was indeed still the best indicator.</p>
<p>Now, people are saying there’s a move away from manufacturing to services, so therefore electricity is not as important as it once was. There may be a little bit of truth in that, but nonetheless, when you look at all the range of indicators that we have, electricity, I believe, is still number one.</p>
<p>We’re seeing so many other signs of minimal growth that I think electricity still is telling us what the Chinese economy is doing.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>And Rail Volume Has Fallen</strong>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Rail-volume.png"><img alt="And Theres Less Stuff Moving Around" src="images/Rail-volume.png?resize=640%2C295"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How relevant is rail freight volume?</strong></p>
<p>Rail freight was one of the three indicators that Premier Li Keqiang mentioned as the things that he looked at when he was a provincial party secretary. This is going back to 2007, when he was talking to the American ambassador.</p>
<p>This was in a WikiLeaks cable. The three things he mentioned were electricity consumption, rail freight volume, and bank lending. Rail freight volume is something we can measure. It’s something that is easy to verify, and we see it going down.</p>
<p>People say, “Well, more stuff is being moved by truck.” Maybe, but nonetheless, the decline in rail freight volume is especially troubling because it is so large, these percentage decreases. I think that, essentially, we’re looking, again, at another factor showing basically the contraction of the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>I think the manufacturing sector is contracting. It did last year, 2% or 3%, maybe a little bit more. There may be an increase in services, but not nearly enough to make up for the decline in manufacturing, especially because the central government devastated the financial services industry beginning in the middle of July, when they tried to rescue stock prices.</p>
<p>A lot of things are going in the wrong direction right now. Not everything, but a lot of them.</p>
<p><strong>We’ll get to the stuff that’s going in the right direction in a little bit.</strong></p>
<p>That’s a one‑minute discussion.</p>
<p><strong>It seemed a bit that way when I started digging through the data. What is going in the right direction?</strong></p>
<p>There are more retail sales, certainly not as much as the central government statistics indicate. The problem with the increase in consumption, I think, is that it’s basically a derivative of growth elsewhere, especially growth of investment.</p>
<p>Investment growth is completely unsustainable. It’s anti‑reform. When investment growth starts to choke even more than it is now, I think it’s going to take consumption with it. What we’re seeing from consumer products companies is some growth, but not very much.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to report, “Oh, say, well, the growth of volume over Alibaba’s platforms and JD.com, online retailers,” but they’re really taking away sales from bricks and mortar. When you start to look at companies that sell across both platforms, online and offline, there really is unimpressive growth or even some contraction in the earnings of these companies related to China.</p>
<p>There’s some positive story there, but it’s not enough to counteract the collapse of manufacturing.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The Export Picture Is Grim</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Exports.png"><img alt="A Grim Export Picture" src="images/Exports.png?resize=640%2C327"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Should we be taking the recent export numbers as an accurate signal?</strong></p>
<p>There might be a little bit of distortion related to Chinese New Year, but when you combine January and February numbers for both imports and exports, they’re both down deep in the double digits. That eliminates entirely the New Year effect.</p>
<p>Trade is just disastrous. You notice that Premier Li Keqiang, in his work report, didn’t have a target for trade this year. That’s the first time, I think, ever. For the last four years, they have not met their target.</p>
<p>Last year, their target was 6% growth in exports and imports combined. It actually came out down 8%. They missed by 14 percentage points. It’s not getting any better, as we saw from January and February.</p>
<p>This is a real indication of problems in the Chinese economy. The import number, I think, is the more important one because that reflects manufacturing demand, and it also reflects consumer demand. You have some pretty atrocious‑looking numbers coming out of imports and exports.</p>
<p>Certainly, just looking at this chart, even if you take the 12‑month average, it’s negative. There’s a very senior person on Bloomberg saying, “Oh, no, it’s not that bad. It’s only down 4% on average all year,” which seems like a spurious argument.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Aluminum Consumption Fell Sharply</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/aluminum-.png"><img alt="A Sharp Drop in Aluminum Consumption" src="images/aluminum-.png?resize=640%2C294"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Is there anything in particular to be made about of the drop-off in aluminum consumption?</strong></p>
<p>That’s a reflection of contraction of manufacturing. You’re going to see that in steel and coal statistics as well. That’s pretty much across the board in the manufacturing sector.</p>

<p><strong>It Appears China Is in an Industrial Recession</strong></p>

<p><strong>The satellite index is the most negative and, presumably, the most reliable.</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to hide from space. The satellite indices have been the most negative, but even traditional ones, the one done by Markit, the London‑based research firm, it’s just been continually negative in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Even their services indices, which are still above water, they’re heading towards the contraction point. This is an economy which is slowly grinding to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>If they devalue their currency, presumably it makes their exports more competitive?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but they can’t do that. The reason is they will trigger even worse capital outflow. They’re basically prevented from doing that. Donald Trump says, “Well, they’re manipulating their currency to help their exporters.”</p>
<p>Yes, they are manipulating their currency, but they’re keeping it at an artificially high value. They have to do that to prevent capital outflow. It’s basically our exporters are being helped by China’s currency manipulation now, which is a reversal, of course.</p>
<p>Traditionally, China kept its currency below its market value in order to help exporters. Now, it’s keeping it above market value.</p>

<p><strong>Industrial Profits Aren’t Growing</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Chinese-industrial-companies.png"><img alt="Long-Lived Profit Recession" src="images/Chinese-industrial-companies.png?resize=640%2C315"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How does the government talk about the stagnation in industrial profits?</strong></p>
<p>They don’t. I think earnings, as reported out of Chinese companies can be a little bit not as reliable because of the nature of the accounting profession and other things. Nonetheless, it’s more reliable than what comes out of the Bureau of National Statistics because some of those numbers are completely made up.</p>
<p>It’s just fantasy land. At least with the accountants, they’ve got to at least have some responsibilities to the market. Therefore, it does give us a better window into what’s actually happening.</p>
<p>**This is true at the revenue level as well. If you look at the Shanghai Composite, revenues are not growing. This is also true of indices in the States. In many ways, it’s the elephant in the room for global equity markets. Is there a way out of this?
**
I don’t think there is a way out of it. I think that they’re heading to that adjustment as the Chinese economy continues to slow. Especially when it gets to that contraction point, where it’s very close already, then I think we’re going to see a lot of things happen very quickly.</p>
<p>They’re just hanging on right now, and they’re able to do that. They can slow the inevitable, but they can’t prevent it because they have not been able to repeal the laws of economics. That’s why they’ve now got this fight with Moody’s over their ratings.</p>
<p>That just shows, Moody’s said, “Look, you can’t have the impossible trinity.” China then gets outraged that Moody’s would ever say that. What China’s trying to do is say, “Well, oh, the laws of economics do not apply to China.” They do apply. They apply differently because of the degree of state control, which is becoming more and more state control, but nonetheless, they cannot prevent the inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) Are Booming</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.23.52-AM.png"><img alt="Booming NPLs" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.23.52-AM.png?resize=640%2C307"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Does this headline increase in non-performing (NPLs) capture the reality?</strong></p>
<p>The numbers have gone up, but the reported number is not nearly as high as they, in effect, are, because people are not applying international standards.</p>
<p>A lot of this stuff is being rolled over, and so, therefore, it’s being counted as good. It’s only good because banks have been ordered not to call in loans. This means we’ve seen a lot of credit growth, but we haven’t seen growth in the economy, which you would expect.</p>
<p>As interest builds up, you have to lend more and more just to roll over what exists. That’s what occurring now. If you were to actually apply international standards to the loan books of these banks, we’d be seeing NPL ratios of 20%–30%, easy.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Banking Assets Are Ballooning</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.24.11-AM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-22 at 112411 AM" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.24.11-AM.png?resize=640%2C282"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>We’ve got overall banking assets that have slowed to “just” 40% growth year on year.</strong></p>
<p>It’s crazy. It’s absolutely crazy. What they’re doing is they’re just throwing a lot of money. People say, “Well, look, they’ve got a relatively high reserve requirement ratio for the banks, and they’ve got relatively high interest rates.”</p>
<p>They say, “Therefore, they have a lot of ammunition.” No, they don’t, because you can throw more money into this economy, and it isn’t going to do any good because there’s a fundamental lack of demand for money.</p>
<p>Yes, the government will build infrastructure, and yes, technically that does create gross domestic product, but it’s only government directed. Private businesses just don’t have a need for money, unless it’s connected to some government infrastructure or other government program.</p>
<p>That means, essentially, that it isn’t going to work. You throw more money in this economy, you just have more money. You don’t have more growth.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a sad state in the world, when you think about it, if people are sitting around going, “Oh, you know, I don’t need more money.” That says a lot.</strong></p>
<p>That says a lot. China’s not the only country with that problem, but their problem is so much greater than our problem here in the States, for instance.</p>

<p><strong>Did a Memo Go Out?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.25.06-AM.png"><img alt="Did a Memo Go Out" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.25.06-AM.png?resize=640%2C296"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The all‑system financing aggregate hit an all‑time high, after having been trending downward. Is this just evidence that the government is opening a spigot somewhere?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. They’ve done this before, and they say they’re not going to do it again, because Premier Wen Jiabao, who authorized the stimulus program in November 2008, he put too much money into the economy.</p>
<p>He created about as much credit in five years as the entire US banking system, even though in November 2008 the Chinese economy was less than a third the size of America’s. Everyone said, “Well, look, that’s not what we should be doing.”</p>
<p>They say, “Oh, no, no, no, no, we’ll never do that,” but of course, that’s exactly what they’re doing. A memo did go out. Everyone was told to lend, and this is what we got. We got a lot of money supply.</p>

<p><strong>Real Estate: Supply Crunch?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.25.27-AM.png"><img alt="A Supply Crunch in Real Estate" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.25.27-AM.png?resize=640%2C318"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>If you look at the leading indicators of inventory, like land purchased and the actual amount of real estate that’s under construction, you see it trending down. Meanwhile, you see a 50% year-on-year increase in the price of one square meter in a Tier 1 city.</strong></p>
<p>Tier 1 cities, there is still demand for real estate. There’s no question about that. When you start going to Tier 3 cities, there’s just enormous amount of supply, and there’s very little demand, so it’s a bifurcated market.</p>
<p>If you’re in Beijing and Shanghai, you have a relatively healthy real estate market, and prices are still going up. You start to get out of China’s major cities, and there are real problems. What they did to create growth in the past was just to build, build, and build, and now they don’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Even in places like Guangdong Province, which is a relatively prosperous, modern province, you now have calls for state enterprises to buy apartments, because that’s the only way they can do this to solve their problem, use one state entity to bail out another.</p>
<p>There’s a real problem once you get out of Beijing, and Shanghai, and Guangzhou.</p>
<p><strong>Where I live in Brooklyn, a million bucks buys you a fixer‑upper, but travel 500 miles in any direction and you can have almost whatever you want for that price. Is that the analogy?</strong></p>
<p>That’s the same thing, yeah.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>A Retail-Driven Bubble?</strong>
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.00-AM.png"><img alt="A Retail-Driven Bubble" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.00-AM.png?resize=640%2C325"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>I want to ask you about retail investors and the domestic stock market. One of the things you notice when you look into it is there’s this incredible boom in the number of trading accounts that were opened in the mainland. Then, the government discontinued the statistics on it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About two or three months after they discontinued the statistics, the Shanghai Composite hit its recent high. Did we see recent inflows of retail investors who were basically gamblers? Is that what’s going on?</strong></p>
<p>There was a lot of that, especially because when you start to go back to September 2014 or so. Keqiang’s policy was to talk up the stock market. You did have a lot of retail investors start to go into it, especially when prices started to move up. That created momentum.</p>
<p>That’s why you have a sharp increase in the number of retail accounts in the first part of 2015. Then, of course, June occurs. You have the beginnings of real problems. The markets start to turn down. Then you have retail investors start to leave, because they’ve been burned, lost their money.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of it was retail driven, but also, there’s Chinese institutional money in there. Even some foreign money’s starting to flood in when they saw the markets turn up. There’s a lot of stuff going in, but the real sensitive stuff was the Chinese retail investors. When they get burned, that becomes a social stability issue.</p>

<p><strong>Why Do Vehicle Sales Keep Growing?</strong>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.29-AM.png"><img alt="Why Are Vehicles Still Selling So Well" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.29-AM.png?resize=640%2C280"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Vehicle sales seem to be a bright point though.</strong></p>
<p>Vehicle sales have done really well. Vehicle sales started to tail off last summer, but they’ve recovered. Right now, they’re starting to turn down again. This has been a real pillar industry, and we have seen state enterprises go out and buy vehicles in the hundreds. They then store them. That’s called lot rot. There’s been a certain amount of that.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’s no question that vehicle sales have held up well. Either you see the wealthy in Tier 1 cities buying cars at a pretty healthy clip. I don’t think that’s going to last, but, nonetheless, it is one of the bright spots.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>So Bad It’s Good?</strong>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.48-AM.png"><img alt="So Bad Its Good" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.26.48-AM.png?resize=640%2C334"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>There’s some sense that we’re getting totally used to the negative economic surprises that are coming out. Our expectations are low. Maybe the news is so bad it’s good on China. I wonder how you’d react to that statement.</strong></p>
<p>Apart from what we saw in August and September last year when it was, as I mentioned, unimportant news really triggered very big falls in equity markets around the world. Now, I think people are not focused on China. They’re focused on problems closer to home.</p>
<p>I think that’s what’s really driving markets right now much more so than that. When China starts to have real troubles, then again, we’re going to see the same phenomena that we saw last August and September. Again, I don’t think that bad China news has really been discounted.</p>
<p>A lot of people still say low sixes for growth. People are saying four, which the consensus is now at. If it really is closer to one or two, then clearly they haven’t discounted all the bad news. When it gets to zero and negative one, watch out.</p>
<p><strong>Presumably there’s even a threat to the government’s ability to stay in power at that point.</strong></p>
<p>People talk about that right now. I was on a panel for a bank with Asian connections in Boston [several] weeks ago. Afterwards, a young Chinese woman came up to my wife, and she’s the type who would come to the United States, get an education, work five years, and then go back to China for their career.</p>
<p>She told my wife, “I’m not going back. None of my friends are going back. My friends in China are saying this government might not last.” Yeah, there’s a lot of talk about that right now among Chinese themselves. There is a real issue about where this is going to go.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Can the Government Keep Growing Revenues?</strong>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.27.08-AM.png"><img alt="Can The Government Keep Growing Revenues" src="images/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.27.08-AM.png?resize=640%2C295"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>One potentially reassuring thing is that the government has done a decent job at actually growing its revenues, although it’s grown debt much faster.</strong></p>
<p>Spending is growing much faster than revenue growth.</p>
<p>Yes, there was revenue growth in 2015, something on the order of, I forget exactly, like 7% or 8%. Fiscal spending last year, according to the government itself, was up 15.8%. There’s a pretty big gap there, and those are official numbers. Who knows what the real numbers are.</p>
<p>We know that a lot of central government spending is not disclosed in the central government’s budget. Military, for instance. A lot of military expenditures are not there.</p>
<p>There have been fantastic increases in fiscal spending. Last October, fiscal spending year on year up 36.1%. November it was up 15.9%. They didn’t disclose December, and I don’t blame them, probably because it was pretty bad. This is an out of control spending government.</p>
<p>While it’s good for them that they’ve got some revenues and they’re able to drive that line higher, they’re not able to drive it as fast as spending.</p>
<p>You’ve got to remember that in the work reports that we’ve been seeing at the National People’s Congress meeting, they’re increasing their deficit from 2.4% of GDP, which is what they claimed for 2015, to 3% this year.</p>
<p>Now, 3% is a psychological line, not just for the Chinese but for others. China is probably going to bust through 3% in reality, because they don’t disclose all their spending. Who knows what they’re going to be next year. This is not going in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>I realize I haven’t asked you at all about security. China’s neighbor and a critical part of the global security question is North Korea, who’s been testing their nuclear weapons . . .</strong></p>
<p>And long‑range missiles.</p>
<p><strong>. . . and threatening to use them preemptively. How should we be contextualizing that? Will China be an effective partner in working with the North, and what really can be done there?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think so, for a lot of reasons. First of all, the China and North Korea relation has eroded, especially after the execution of Jang Sung‑taek in December 2013, because Jang handled relations with Beijing.</p>
<p>The real problem is you’ve got a government in North Korea, a regime, where you have Kim Jung Un, the ruler, feuding with the military, which is still the most important institution in North Korean society. It’s unstable, and I don’t think the Chinese or anybody else can actually have much influence where you have intense infighting.</p>
<p>Plus, also, you’ve got intense infighting in Beijing. Not as bad as it looks like in Pyongyang, but, nonetheless, this is an unstable situation as well. You’ve got two governments right now that are starting to splinter, and that means that north Asia is exceedingly dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>That’s not great news, but thank you so much, Gordon, for sharing your view and for spending time with us. I’m sure Enterprising Investor readers are quite pleased to have your perspective, as well.</strong></p>
