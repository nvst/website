<h2 id="finance-shouldnt-think-small"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/04/21/finance-shouldnt-think-small/">Finance Shouldn't Think Small</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>Let’s adopt a straightforward view of a hypothetical business. This business has two types of units: those that make what the business sells and those that enable those units.</p>
<p>This is simple at first. At a bubblegum company, you can usually figure out who is involved in making the bubble gum and who is focused on taking care of other problems so that the company can make bubble gum.</p>
<p>The vice president of new flavors? Definitely on the “making things” side. The CFO? Almost always on the “other stuff” side.</p>
<p>It turns out that what’s true for the individual or the unit is true for the industry. The products and services that the financial industry provides are usually not ends in themselves. They are built to fulfill goals that others — organizations and individuals — have.</p>
<p>**So Finance Is for Facilitation
**</p>
<p>This should be obvious. When investment advisers construct a portfolio for an individual, they are taking a pool of assets and arranging it so that it can facilitate the client’s livelihood. Investment bankers restructuring a company are doing the same thing: they are intervening to facilitate a future.</p>
<p>In a lot of thinking along these lines, this is the part where the author tells you it’s all about the client.</p>
<p>Reactions to that tend to fall into one of two camps. You either nod self-assuredly and congratulate yourself for being one of the good ones who already knew what was important. Or you close the browser tab with an eye roll and remark on how people who talk about this sort of thing are always full of lofty rhetoric but offer little in the way of tangible suggestions.</p>
<p>So I’m not going to tell you anything I already warned you to look out for. Instead, how about I suggest a few areas where there is a real need for attention, where the tools of finance can have a positive and transformative impact? Places where, as far as I can tell, there is a chorus standing on top of the industry and screaming:</p>
<p><strong>Financial Innovation Welcome!</strong></p>
<p>Let me lay out the areas that, according to consensus, appear ripe for disruption. These are the places where the horses are already well out of the gate, and which you may have already heard about on the nightly news. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disintermediating banking.</strong> There is the payment side (with bitcoin and various apps) as well as the lending side, where peer-to-peer lending appears to promise a credit market free of middlemen. My colleague Ron Rimkus, CFA, <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/04/08/bitcoins-new-gold-or-fools-gold/">has written a lot about</a> the <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/01/14/warren-buffett-wrong-on-bitcoin-the-bitcoin-proof/">bitcoin side of this equation</a>, and it’s probably wise to stay in touch with trends in this space. Especially if you own shares in banks that make money by charging fees to lend money and transfer it, it will pay to be aware of potential existential threats in this area.</li>
<li><strong>Replacing your financial adviser.</strong> You haven’t had to pay for financial advice for quite a few years, and <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/12/01/free-investing-is-the-new-free-checking-2/">I’m on the record saying that free financial advice will eventually be as common as free checking</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Making better investment decisions.</strong> I use <a href="http://www.sentieo.com/">Sentieo</a> and <a href="https://www.quandl.com/">Quandl</a> (as well as a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/professional/?utm_source=bloomberg-menu&amp;bbgsum=DG-WS-09-12-CORE-bbgmenu">Bloomberg</a>) to simplify my research process, and with services like these, it’s getting easier and easier for someone with questions to find the answers they need to make better decisions. Even the Twitter feeds I follow have become a powerful tool to learn more faster and improve my decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are definitely more things to be done. There are almost certainly new businesses that can be built in areas that I haven’t mentioned but are still part of the traditional finance “stack”: insurance, maturity transformation, and capital raising, to name a few.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean the industry should think small.</p>
<p>There is a refrain in public opinion that calls for something I will dub “little finance.” This is finance without innovation. Finance as a utility. I want to focus on areas that aren’t traditionally considered “financial” but could eventually be, in the hopes that it will encourage our readers to think a bit bigger.</p>
<p>So, fully recognizing that our role as middlemen is and always will be to facilitate transactions on behalf of someone else who is acting with a clear end in mind, we need to be asking ourselves a simple question:</p>
<p><strong>What New Thing Can We Facilitate?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no excellent reason that insights and practices from the investment profession can’t be applied in new ways, and I think that there’s a lot to be gained from doing that. It might sound weird to think about the way investors approach the world as a technology that can be applied to other fields. It might even look funny to try, but anyone who’s ever <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop-culture/article/eating-cheetos-with-chopsticks" title="Link: http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop-culture/article/eating-cheetos-with-chopsticks">used chopsticks to eat Cheetos</a> knows that those risky ideas sometimes pay off. Here are three places where I think there might be room for something remarkable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improving charitable donations.</strong> There’s a decent amount of evidence that charitable capital is allocated suboptimally. If you don’t believe me, spend five minutes with Eric Friedman’s excellent <a href="http://reinventingphilanthropy.com/" title="Link: http://reinventingphilanthropy.com/">Reinventing Philanthropy</a> and then come back here and comment. There must be a way to turn a simple truth — most people don’t think carefully about their charitable donations — into a product that people can really use.</li>
<li><strong>Bring power tools to budgeting.</strong> As a straightforward example, most consumer-facing financial software like <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> and <a href="https://levelmoney.com/">Level Money</a> (which I use and love despite its shortcomings) allow an individual to create a version of a balance sheet and a cash flow statement. But they’re missing something: income statements! These are invaluable in the analysis of companies, but consumers don’t have access to them in evaluating their spending.</li>
<li><strong>Recontextualize the world.</strong> There’s a lot of evidence that people have a hard time budgeting. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/162872/one-three-americans-prepare-detailed-household-budget.aspx" title="Link: http://www.gallup.com/poll/162872/one-three-americans-prepare-detailed-household-budget.aspx">Just one in three Americans do it</a>, and I’d bet that far fewer of those stick to their budgets. Part of that is likely because money is an arbitrary unit of account. What if we started building products that made people’s financial transactions look more like the way they see the world? Hipsters could spend 400 lattes on rent instead of $1600 dollars, or maybe even 60 hours of work. If people can begin sensing money more intuitively, a lot of good things might happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>This all comes with a substantive caveat. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c">It’s all my opinion</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reasons-we-honor-irving-khan-cfa"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/03/05/the-reasons-we-honor-irving-khan-cfa/">The Reasons we Honor Irving Khan, CFA</a></h2>
<p><em>I learned a tremendous amount writing this piece. It was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>About 10 days ago <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/irving-kahn-investor-who-made-money-in-1929-crash-dies-at-109">a young man passed away to whom CFA Institute owes a lot</a>. He was 109. His name was Irving Kahn, CFA.</p>
<p>I never had the pleasure of meeting him, but I do have the honor of starting a discussion about his legacy in this forum and talking about what his example means to me — and what it should mean to professional investors everywhere.</p>
<p>Why do we choose to honor this man? Perhaps it's because as a teaching assistant to <a href="http://celebrate.cfainstitute.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/beginning/irving-kahn.html">Benjamin Graham, he watched and guided the creation of this industry from the very beginning</a>. Or perhaps it's because he belonged to the first class of CFA charterholders, a group of people who set in motion a social movement that helped professionalize the world of investing. He was among the founders of the <a href="http://www.nyssa.org/">New York Society of Security Analysts</a>, one of our largest societies, as well as the <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/loi/faj">Financial Analysts Journal</a>, a sister <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/op.v2005.n1.4653?journalCode=op">publication</a> to the Enterprising Investor.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's because, at 109 years old, he still loved the stuff that we professional investors do day in and day out. Kahn was still working when he passed away, even though he had more than earned his retirement and could have moved somewhere with a better climate than New York City and lived a life of leisure.</p>
<p><strong>I Guess He Just Loved This Game.</strong></p>
<p>The investment industry is considered boring by the uninitiated. We are unrepentant geeks. We print out annual reports and read them in alphabetical order. Our nicknames for things — the Swissie, crack spreads, 2s10s — make literally no sense to other people. When our contemporaries are profiled in the media, they often come off as morally bankrupt. This characterization is so common that it's <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyBankruptBanker" title="Link: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyBankruptBanker">discussed as a TV Trope</a>.</p>
<p>So when we, or at least, when I see a distinguished investor quietly grinding out alpha because he likes it, I find it inspiring. I like it, too.</p>
<p>And hearing about someone else who likes it makes me feel like a little bit less of a nerd. So in part I honor him because I hope I can retain his enthusiasm. But I also honor him because there is much to learn from his example. In particular, I think he did three things that every professional investor should emulate.</p>
<p><strong>He Read Different News Sources.</strong></p>
<p>One of the more intriguing stories about Irving that I've come across is that he was actually responsible for the expansion of the Financial Times to the United States. In the early 1950s, he would — at great expense — procure copies of the pink paper because he was fascinated with European companies. When he later traveled to London, he met with the FT to see if he could convince them to begin publishing in the United States. They laughed at him. By the time he was <a href="http://cfa-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/investor/files/2015/03/Irving-Kahn-CFA-Magazine-.pdf">profiled for CFA Magazine</a>, they had been hand delivering a weekend Financial Times to him for more than 40 years as a way of saying "thank you" and "we're sorry."</p>
<p><strong>He Didn't Keep His Knowledge to Himself.</strong></p>
<p>When Irving got to Wall Street, "analyst" was not a job title. Analysts were called statisticians. We owe the existence of the investment management profession in large part to the work of Irving and his mentor Benjamin Graham, who would trek up from Wall Street to Columbia Business School after work to teach others how to properly analyze companies. Many people would have just turned in year after year of stellar performance and allowed their investors to believe they were magicians instead of passing on their knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>He Kept Learning.</strong></p>
<p>There are very few widely respected investors who don't spend most of their time engaged in their primary job: learning new stuff. Kahn could have decided after 30 (or 40, 50, 60, or even 70) years of experience that he had all the knowledge he needed, and fallen into the trap of trying to force markets to fit his well-constructed beliefs rather than updating them. Instead, he kept reading.</p>
<p>I imagine that the investment career I have ahead of me will be different in many ways from the one that Kahn had. At the very least, I'll never have the same difficulty getting a hold of the Financial Times. I hope I can mimic his example in these three important ways though. What about you? What did you learn from him or his example that we should all think about? </p>

<h2 id="apple-macro-trends-and-global-inequality"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/03/04/apple-macro-trends-and-global-inequality/">Apple, Macro Trends, and Global Inequality</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Am I the only one starting to feel like we’re pretty darn late in the business cycle? </p>
<p>With venture capital investment <a href="https://www.pwcmoneytree.com/HistoricTrends/CustomQueryHistoricTrend">surpassing 1999 quarterly levels</a> and <a href="http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/">cyclically adjusted P/E ratios</a> that reach ever skyward, it’s certainly getting easier to pursue that line of argumentation. Five-plus years after the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/sept2010.html">official end of the last recession</a>, a betting man has to wonder if we’re due.</p>
<p>Of course, the only thing that investing and betting have in common is that if you’re going to be good at either, you’d better understand probability. This week, I’ve curated a bunch of charts focused on macro trends as well as Apple’s future and global inequality that I hope will help you understand a couple of key elements of your risk equation, both personally and professionally. The goal is that you’ll be able to better align your time and your capital with your beliefs in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p><a href="http://srvo.org/enter-the-sloane-zone">You should subscribe to my newsletter</a> if that sort of thing sounds exciting to you. </p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s ask the question that seems to be on everybody’s mind: can Apple keep growing?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">RT <a href="https://twitter.com/jyarow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jyarow</a>: Morgan Stanley is drunk on Apple. <a href="http://t.co/X4Y78gaxW0">http://t.co/X4Y78gaxW0</a> <a href="http://t.co/mp9pkXsxPN">pic.twitter.com/mp9pkXsxPN</a></p>— Henry Blodget (@hblodget) <a href="https://twitter.com/hblodget/status/572441990190764032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>I guess I shouldn’t be too critical of Apple, since I’m writing this post in between my MacBook Air and my iPhone. I have also been <a href="http://srvo.org/a-new-era-in-human-computer-interaction">bullish on the Apple Watch</a> almost since it was announced. But this seems like an . . . um . . . aggressive increase in addressable market, especially when you remember that “addressable” does not imply Apple will necessarily capture any particular share of the market at any particular margin.</p>
<p>I love my Apple products, but exuberance for this company seems to have drifted from thoughts like “they will continue to execute really well on their core competency” to “they will invent three completely new markets.” Granted, if they were to execute well on even one of the three, it would be big. But what sort of risks are you taking as a new investor? How many technology companies that reached the level of dominance that Apple has were in a comparable position 10 years later? This time might be different. But if Warren Buffett <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2014ltr.pdf">complains</a> he will not be able to earn as great of a return on his capital in the future as he has in the past across his <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/subs/sublinks.html">myriad subsidiaries</a>, how probable is it that Tim Cook will be able to at Apple?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="und">OK. <a href="http://t.co/cvurvVpmXp">pic.twitter.com/cvurvVpmXp</a></p>— Jay Yarow (@jyarow) <a href="https://twitter.com/jyarow/status/572408119663431680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>I had to include this because I love Jay’s tweet, but I also wanted to pick up on an element of this chart that seems confusing. It is intuitive to imagine that people will consume an increasing amount of content while in transit (particularly if the self-driving car thing takes off), but can we talk about the implied spend on content that’s baked in here?</p>
<p>Assuming that the car of tomorrow costs about as much in real terms as a <a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/accord-sedan/price.aspx">base-model 2015 Honda Accord</a> ($22,105) and that its cost roughly equates to its value, there is apparently $4,421 of “content value” in the car of tomorrow. If you assume the car is bought for, say, a five-year time horizon, that’s an undiscounted additional $74 a month that consumers are expected to spend on content. Color me skeptical.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here’s what people do with their lives, per Morgan Stanley: <a href="http://t.co/OsUoc70bqU">http://t.co/OsUoc70bqU</a> <a href="http://t.co/fvT2rfmmMG">pic.twitter.com/fvT2rfmmMG</a></p>— Jay Yarow (@jyarow) <a href="https://twitter.com/jyarow/status/572443578498207745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>This is a little creepy, and it’s indicative of what happens when you grow to such scale that you’re not really sure what to do next. The notion of one technology company involving itself in every layer of my life like this is deeply reminiscent of <a href="http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/232010/the-circle/">The Circle</a> and also seems massively difficult to execute. What product does Apple plan to release that will break into the sleeping area of our lives, pray tell?</p>

<p>And are those estimates of how Americans spend their time really correct?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Aussie house prices up 10.5% annual rate over last 3mths... <a href="http://t.co/TE7DHyhxXm">http://t.co/TE7DHyhxXm</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfSteveKeen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ProfSteveKeen</a> <a href="http://t.co/HjJdrP7sI2">pic.twitter.com/HjJdrP7sI2</a></p>— christopher joye (@cjoye) <a href="https://twitter.com/cjoye/status/572235415438024704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.afr.com/p/blogs/christopher_joye/housing_boom_is_out_of_control_7XPcS3u3NjQXB1lq4BqsjL">Australian house prices are climbing more than four times faster than Australian wages,</a>which is no fun for folks Down Under (unless they happen to own their house). An interesting thing that Chris notes in the article that’s linked under the chart is that the bulk of Australian mortgages are tied to short-term rates, and so there’s significant reason to believe that this activity is driven directly by local interest rate policy.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Note negative segment of German yield curve <a href="http://t.co/hgH5jt0B1z">pic.twitter.com/hgH5jt0B1z</a></p>— Genevieve Signoret (@gsignoret) <a href="https://twitter.com/gsignoret/status/572241458431844353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Which, in case you forgot, is heading in a similar direction pretty much everywhere. I included this chart to make another point: It may not be in fashion to refer to interest rates in the United States as “high,” but when compared to those in Germany and Japan, they certainly are. Next time you find yourself surrounded by financial services workers and eager to find some amusement, try talking about how stubbornly high interest rates are in the United States and report back in the comments section. I would love to hear the reaction you get.</p>

<p>This chart is hyper-interesting but I particularly like it in the context of the one below, which adds quite a bit more historical background.</p>

<p>This is not a great comparison: The chart above shows the comparison between European companies and their own debt, while this shows the comparison in yield between the S&amp;P 500 and the US 10-year bond. But it makes a point that is forgotten quite a bit: Stocks can yield more than bonds. This is true especially in contexts where the market outlook sees future growth as challenged (like in Europe).</p>

<p>Since the integrity of the euro is routinely called into question these days, this graph seems especially applicable.

Kudos to whoever decided to rank it against the 14 countries beginning with the letter “M.” </p>

<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>While listening to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio" title="Link: http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio">BBC World Service</a> a little over a week ago, I came upon a story that got me thinking about the labor force and the factors that drive economic growth. What followed was a multi-day period during which I spent a lot of quality time with Microsoft Excel, ate all of the animal crackers in our New York City office, and repeatedly apologized to <a href="https://twitter.com/paulmccaffrey7?lang=en">editor Paul McCaffrey</a> for turning this post in late.</p>
<p>So what set me wondering? </p>
<p>Egypt <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/says-beheaded-egyptian-copts-libya-193850727.html">made headlines</a> over Presidents’ Day weekend by attacking Islamic State militants in Libya. The militants had apparently beheaded 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in a brutal mass execution. Given the well-documented violence and disorder in Libya, I wondered what had driven the victims to locate there.</p>
<p>It turns out they knowingly risked their lives to find work. After speaking to an Egyptian Christian who said he plans to go to Libya soon as well, the BBC ended the segment with a stark assertion: many people would rather die seeking work in Libya than go on living in abject poverty where they are.</p>
<p><strong>Wow</strong></p>
<p>For those suffering from the injustice of extreme poverty, life is a series of difficult choices. Evaluating the merits of various career options is rarely one of them. Thinking people tend to hope for a world where living standards rise across the board, but too often this hope omits a depressing question: What is keeping this from happening? Though it’s beyond the scope of one article to suggest comprehensive causality, in this piece I’m going to examine growth in capital and labor markets in an attempt to piece out the places in the world — like Egypt — where exogenous factors are inhibiting GDP growth. (I will leave it up to others, hopefully with a lot more smarts than I currently possess, to isolate what precisely those factors are.)</p>
<p>I’m going to do this by looking at two components of growth — growth in labor and growth in the money supply — as well as growth itself. There are a couple of limitations to this analysis. The first — a big one — is that I’m really supposed to be looking at <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ301/growth_accounting.htm" title="Link: http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ301/growth_accounting.htm">capital rather than money</a> in traditional growth accounting. I’m also supposed to piece out the amount of aggregate growth attributable to both labor and capital individually. I chose to proceed with money (and also to ignore the second step of the analysis) for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>The biggest is that I couldn’t value every single capital asset in the world accurately if I had the cooperation of every one of the 130,000-plus CFA Institute members on the planet and a full year. It might take that long just to settle on an appropriate discount rate. That’s before we talk about the precise attribution of growth to different factors, which would likely take even longer.</p>
<p>I’m okay with using money instead of capital because this is intrinsically a “back-of-the-envelope” exercise. I am just mapping national growth using a consistent method, not trying to work towards a new truth in economics. My hope is that this work is helpful in generating ideas for further research as well as in digesting global growth patterns. If it inspires a heated discussion about the difference between stocks and flows in economics or a better stand-in for capital, I’m all ears. If you include a link to a time series, I might even update the charts.</p>

<p><strong>The Global Labor Force</strong></p>

<p>I figured I’d start this off with something that represents “consensus” thinking. </p>
<p>In many conversations about growth, there are three places that tend to be the focus of discussion: the developed world (represented by the OECD, which was at one time <a href="http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/global-governance/%E2%80%98club-rich%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98globalisation-%C3%A0-la-carte%E2%80%99-evaluating-reform-oecd">referred to as a “club of the rich</a>” and is never growing fast enough to satisfy), China, and India. In terms of how to slice up the globe, this can be a useful strategy. </p>
<p>But if we start by just considering the labor force, there is — quite literally — an entire world of growth that is obscured by that method . . .</p>
<hr/>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-24-16.13.51.png"><img alt="Total Labor Force Growth 19992013" src="images/Screenshot-2015-02-24-16.13.51.png?resize=640%2C433" title="Image: https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-24-16.13.51.png?resize=640%2C433"/></a></p>

<hr/>
<p>And that the non-China, non-India, non-OECD labor force is growing at a much faster rate than in the three places mentioned above. Now remember: Growth in the labor force only represents potential economic growth, not actual or even probable growth. But let’s set that aside for a moment. Which countries’ labor forces grew the fastest from 1999–2013?</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Cumulative Labor Force Growth 1999–2013</strong></p>

<hr/>
<p>This chart is misleading on purpose. </p>
<p>Some countries grew so fast that they threw off the scale and made the comparison less meaningful. So I stripped them out of the above. Those countries where the labor force grew by 70% or more from 1999–2013 are below.</p>

<p>I colored the countries that are traditionally considered part of the Middle East blue. Did you expect these results?</p>
<p>Granted, this is not necessarily material at the global level, but it doesn’t need to be to be interesting. The 14 countries shown here had just over 42-million people in their labor forces in 2013, but given that they had just over 19 million in 1999, it warrants some examination. It seems clear a remarkable transformation is taking place in the Middle East. If you’ve ever wondered why CFA Institute has been holding an annual <a href="http://meic.cfainstitute.org/">Middle East Investment Conference</a> for the last few years, one of the factors that makes the region interesting should be clearer now. There are a lot of people looking for something to do.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Money Supply</strong></p>
<p>So what about the money part of this equation? Well, let’s take a look at another pie chart.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Perhaps this chart is why people are so focused on the OECD, China, and India? It makes sense that if roughly 90% of the world’s money is flowing around those places, they merit substantial attention. . . .</p>

<p>This slide is just in case you didn’t notice how outsized China was in the previous chart. China’s economic growth is probably grist in and of itself for another charts post. But suffice it to say, China’s money supply expanded by more than an order of magnitude from 1999–2013. If a roughly average-sized baby (48.5 cm in length) was to grow at the same rate over the same period, we would have an adolescent who is more than 4.8-meters tall on our hands.</p>
<p>A note on the data here: I’ve seen different numbers from different sources on M2 levels in these countries but decided to stick with the World Bank numbers just to stay as consistent as possible. Now that I’ve disclaimed suitably, we can ask the important question: Is China to money supply what the United Arab Emirates is to the labor force? Let’s take a look.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Cumulative Money Supply Growth 1999–2013</strong></p>
<iframe height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D5HN8aXfYo3Yo2YvkiYt7Snegu5dQdcjnFLas0h1dfA/pubchart?oid=1334679784&amp;format=interactive" width="800"></iframe>
<hr/>
<p>Actually, that’d be Azerbaijan you’re looking for, but China’s not so far off. If you look past Azerbaijan’s 4,471% growth in money supply over this period, China is looking pretty good. I’ll flag as well that at 1,654% and 860%, respectively, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates also had some substantial money supply growth.</p>
<p><strong>Global GDP</strong></p>
<p>Now, my initial plan was to look at money supply and labor force growth and then see how actual economic growth has correlated with what we might have imputed from looking only at those two factors. Before we do that, let’s look at how global GDP was distributed in 1999.</p>
<hr/>

<hr/>
<p>And compare that to how it’s distributed now.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-24-16.20.54.png"><img alt="Relative Share of World GDP 2013 The Eccentric Pizza World" src="images/Screenshot-2015-02-24-16.20.54.png?resize=640%2C440" title="Image: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-24-16.20.54.png?resize=640%2C440"/></a></p>

<hr/>
<p>The timescale here is an interesting one for the purposes of this comparison. During the transition from the Pac-Man distribution of GDP to the eccentric pizza distribution, the world has gone through nearly two complete economic cycles. As you can sense from these two point-in-time illustrations, the gap in growth has been substantial.</p>

<p>It’s getting easier and easier for me to assume you agree that the OECD is not the engine of global growth — and, hopefully, that you’re willing to hang on for one more chart, tops. So here you go:</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The Gap between What You’d Expect from Money Supply and Labor Force Growth and What Actually Happened</strong></p>
<iframe height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D5HN8aXfYo3Yo2YvkiYt7Snegu5dQdcjnFLas0h1dfA/pubchart?oid=557697827&amp;format=interactive" width="800"></iframe>
<hr/>
<p>This chart has a straightforward question underpinning it: where did GDP growth not map roughly to money supply and labor force growth?</p>
<p>To answer that, I did something really lazy. I just took the average of the money supply and labor force growth rates, and subtracted that from the growth rate in GDP. In most cases, I got a relatively small number, indicating that GDP growth was basically in line with money supply and labor force growth. It’s important to note, of course, that this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship.</p>
<p>In a few cases though, I saw something interesting. In the countries that are colored deep green (like Indonesia), economic growth was much faster than the growth in labor and the money supply. Conversely, with ruby red countries like Azerbaijan, economic growth was much slower.</p>
<p>These extreme readings suggest that something (which is up to you to determine) is happening in these countries. Fortunately I’m not allowed to make macro calls from my current seat, so I’m conveniently absolved of the responsibility to tell you exactly what to do.</p>
<p>This is also, as I said, a massively “back-of-the-envelope” exercise, so it’s a bit premature to pairs trade the Ukraine against Angola . . . and even if you think you should, I’ll note that these index ratings are not actually meaningful except in reference to the other numbers published in the chart.</p>
<p>There are a couple of good takeaways though. One that I think should be considered is how well this actually relates to growth in many advanced economies. This method is only off by 5% in computing the actual growth rate of the United States economy over this period, and off by almost exactly the same amount in Japan. Is it possible that economic growth is just a function of money supply and labor force growth in these advanced economies?</p>
<p>The former Soviet Union is also (pardon the pun) covered in red. This should be intuitive for those who remember the <a href="http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2010/05/17/000158349_20100517152914/Rendered/PDF/WPS5312.pdf">Russian Financial Crisis of 1998</a>, which put many of these countries at a disadvantage over this time period.</p>
<p>It should also be straightforward that there is a glut of supply in the Middle Eastern labor market, and an interesting question for those who make money with capital should also be straightforward. Is there an investment that will harness the implicit human capital of this rapidly growing labor force?</p>

<p>Charts are fascinating. And I don’t just mean the 14 charts below. In <a href="http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/" title="Link: http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/">one of the more interesting lectures I’ve ever heard</a>, Bret Victor makes a number of really thought-provoking points that I hope you’ll chew over as you skim the images below.</p>
<p>In a discussion focused on designing new media to assist engineers and designers, he observes that “Media are thinking tools,” and by extension posits that “our representations of a system are how we understand them.” Think about that: If we are unable to represent a system visually, can we even understand it? He suggests that due to the limitations of how we represent complex systems, we may actually be unable to think the thoughts that lead to deeper understanding. Have you ever felt that way?</p>
<p>It’s kind of a crazy question. And if your head spins trying to represent your investment process visually, I don’t blame you. The important thing to take away from it, though, is exactly how far away these charts are from a clean visual representation of a system. Analysts often work with a tightly engaged <a href="http://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html">latticework of mental models</a>, but most would struggle to enumerate, describe, and integrate their own set without having previously considered the challenge.</p>
<p>So as you read, remember that you’re limited as well as empowered in your ability to understand. At Enterprising Investor, we’ll do our best to continuously present rigorous, provocative, and inspiring material — as well as philosophical questions and lots of charts. So <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/follow-the-enterprising-investor/">subscribe away</a> if that’s your sort of thing.</p>

<p>Haters gonna hate. It seems like that’s what almost everybody working on a bitcoin project needs to hear, and fortunately I can say that without reservation. Bitcoin manages to excite anarcho-capitalists while simultaneously triggering fears of a one-world government. Meanwhile, with only 382 citations in Google, the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">original paper describing the protocol</a> cannot have been that widely read. I think the technology has a lot of promise, but I’d welcome a variant perspective in the comments below. That said, I’m likely to refer anyone throwing shade on bitcoin out of habit to my colleague Ron Rimkus’s excellent <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/01/14/warren-buffett-wrong-on-bitcoin-the-bitcoin-proof/">Bitcoin Proof</a>.</p>

<p>Are you under the impression that computers keep getting faster and faster? Well, in one way you’re right — software keeps improving, which allows us to do more with less. But the actual clock speeds of computers have remained stagnant. What’s driving that? As <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/116561-the-death-of-cpu-scaling-from-one-core-to-many-and-why-were-still-stuck">this article</a> notes, transistors are getting so small that it’s difficult to prevent electronic current from leaking out of them. It also has a fascinating statistic: Maximum CPU clock speeds only jumped by about a third from 2007 to 2011. From 1994 to 1998, they increased 300%.</p>

<p>Matt’s analysis here is spot on. You can play with the data yourself <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/JTS7200QUL">here</a>, but these quits suggest a level of optimism in lower-level employees that hasn’t been present for quite some time. The November 2014 index reading of 547 is the highest we’ve seen in the United States since May 2008.</p>

<p>If you’re paying attention to the widening income gap — and believe me, I am — it might be surprising to look at an economic time series like this and find optimism levels across income segments narrowing, as opposed to diverging. I will continue to look for other data points suggesting a broadening base of optimism. But especially given the context of Matt’s preceding chart, this is provocative.</p>

<p>On first looking at this chart, I was surprised that the pay gap between genders appeared to be widest in the United States, Scandinavia, and other wealthy countries. A prior version of this post actually suggested that we take economics lessons from Japan. However, <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/02/04/14-charts-worth-your-time/#comment-183368">as Nikola noted in the comments</a>, I totally missed this one. The legend is confusing, but my bad for writing a faulty analysis.</p>

<p>Does the phrase “don’t catch a falling knife” mean anything to you? This price chart of the gold dollar trading prices of Confederate bonds should be stapled to the trading screens of distressed debt analysts. It’s a reminder that you can make a significant short-term gain and then a total loss rapidly thereafter. These bonds rallied in almost a straight line after Hood’s army was destroyed, and then, well, we all know what happened to the Confederate States of America.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things is when a local trend does not correspond to a national aggregate. There are undoubtedly tons of places where water scarcity is causing significant issues, but aggregate water usage seems to have decoupled from growth in GDP. This is undoubtedly a good thing, but one has to wonder how it looks on the local level, particularly in the fast-growing arid/desert regions of the United States. <a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2010/20100721_watermap.jpg" title="Link: http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2010/20100721_watermap.jpg">This chart</a> of the sustainability of various county water supplies seems to indicate trouble for most of the Southwest. Selfishly, it’s a good thing I live in New York City.</p>
