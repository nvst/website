<h2 id="how-we-measure-investment-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/05/08/how-we-measure-investment-performance/">How We Measure Investment Performance</a></h2>
<p>When I started this firm, I used an external vendor (YCharts) to measure the performance of our investment strategies. This worked well for us at the beginning, but as the firm has grown, it became clear that this was sub-optimal.</p>
<p>I had to perform numerous manual data transfer operations each month in order to produce our performance numbers. And with each passing month, I became more and more concerned that these operations were introducing errors into our reported results.</p>
<p>This isn't so relevant for our existing clients. They have always had access to accurate, up-to-date performance information calculated by Altruist, our custodian.</p>
<p>But it's important to me (and our regulators) that prospective clients have access to accurate, timely information about our investment strategies. So as of today, I'm making a material change to the way we measure and present our investment performance.</p>
<p>Please note that this change is only applicable to the <a href="https://investvegan.org/strategies/">performance we show publicly</a> for each of our strategies. If you're a client, the most accurate performance information will always be available to you directly through the Altruist web portal or app.</p>
<p><strong>What's changing?</strong></p>
<p>Each of our strategy pages now shows the performance for an actual fee-paying account that has been invested in that strategy since its inception instead of a calculated value.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you making this change now?</strong></p>
<p>Our recent hire has allowed me to spend additional time auditing our internal processes. I identified a deficiency in our existing approach and moved to correct it.</p>
<p><strong>How significant is this change?</strong></p>
<p>It's significant. We are discontinuing the practice of reporting on our real estate strategy, and restating the historical performance of our other two strategies.</p>
<p>The table below shows the cumulative performance of our Veda Ethical Growth strategy calculated under the new methodology and the old methodology from October 2021 through March 2023, when the old methodology was discontinued for this strategy. Both the new and old calculations include all applicable fees.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>

<p>The change also applies to the Veda Integral portfolio. Please note that this table covers a different time period than the one above. I've included returns from the benchmark in these periods in the hopes that it better calibrates your understanding.</p>

| **New Calculation** | **Old Calculation** | **Benchmark** |

| 7.05% | 4.77% | 2.18% |

<figcaption>

</figure>
<p>I would not presume to decide whether this change is significant on your behalf. Instead, I've presented the old and new calculations for each month of each strategy at the end of this post. And like, created a whole blog post about it so that you can dig into the reasoning, examine the practical implications, and decide whether or not to move on with your life.</p>
<p><strong>Will the way investment performance is calculated change again?</strong></p>
<p>Over time, I hope to converge the approach we use with the <a href="https://www.gipsstandards.org/">Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)</a> promulgated by CFA Institute. Attentive readers will remember that I used to work at that organization, and can probably imagine that I continue to hold its standards in high regard.</p>
<p>If I see an opportunity for us to move towards compliance with these standards without compromising our ability to accept clients with no investment minimum, I will seize it. However, in the meantime I have attempted to strike a practical balance between complexity, accuracy, and timeliness.</p>
<p><strong>I've got questions about this. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Reach out to me directly! You can either <a href="mailto::sloane@investvegan.org">send me an email</a> or <a href="https://calendly.com/ethicalcapital">click here to schedule a meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The stock market is... complicated.</p>
<p>But despite that, it is possible to construct useful understandings of how it behaves through careful study of its long-term performance.</p>
<p>Before we get into that though, let's make sure we share a functional understanding of what we're talking about. Feel free to skip ahead if things get a little too basic for you, but we want to make sure that everyone's able to follow along.</p>
<p>So let's start at the very beginning.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-stock"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#what-is-a-stock"><strong>What is a stock?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Happily, we have a euphonic case study that should help you understand this!</p>
<p>Consider Crocs, the rubber clog company.</p>
<p>At some point in their history, the founders realized that they needed more money in order to manufacture their products. This is a very common situation and can happen to any company whether it's small or large.</p>
<p>Crocs' financial position is summarized by something called a balance sheet, which records all of its assets and liabilities at a given point in time. Assets are things they own, like ideas, resources, or physical inventory, while liabilities are best understood as the way those assets are paid for.</p>
<p>As you might guess from the word "balance," the general idea of these reports is that both sides should sum to the same value. The table below might be a helpful representation of this if you happen to be visually inclined.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Assets</strong></th>
<th><strong>Liabilities</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tangible (Equipment, inventory, etc)</td>
<td>Borrowed money (mortgages, loans, bonds, etc)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intangible (Designs, copyrights, etc)</td>
<td>Equity (often synonymous with "stock")</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Investors are best understood as providers of capital to companies. We have two primary ways of charging the company to use our money: lending it to them through a loan or a bond and investing alongside them as stockholders.</p>
<h3 id="how-are-stocks-and-bonds-different"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#how-are-stocks-and-bonds-different"><strong>How are Stocks and Bonds Different?</strong></a></h3>
<p>The main difference between them is that the return on stock investments is vague and uncertain while the returns that lenders like bond investors experience are generally determined (or at least well described) by a contract.</p>
<p>If the company were to encounter financial hardship or - in an extreme (but illustrative) case - enter liquidation, bondholders would be significantly better protected from financial loss than their stockholder neighbors on the balance sheet. Bondholders generally receive the interest and principal payments they are owed before stockholders get anything in these sorts of adverse situations.</p>
<p>With that said, if the fortunes of the business were to improve, a bondholder's best case would be to get paid back in full. By contrast, stockholders would participate directly and proportionally in the improving fortunes of the company.</p>
<p>These stylized examples don't capture the full spectrum of how these securities interact, but they do convey a few things that are important for long-term investors to internalize:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can use both stocks and bonds to charge companies for the use of our money,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonds have a predetemined payoff, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stocks have an uncertain payoff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-a-stock-portfolio-typically-perform"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#how-does-a-stock-portfolio-typically-perform"><strong>How does a Stock Portfolio Typically Perform?</strong></a></h3>
<p>This is where the fun really begins!</p>
<p>As a practical matter, it is very difficult to forecast the future of any particular company with much precision. We may love our crocs (and be wearing them as we write this essay) but that doesn't mean we can see the company's future clearly.</p>
<p>But when we combine individual stocks into a well-constructed portfolio, things get much easier to predict. Imagine that you purchased shares in the S&amp;P 500 index, which is among the most widely used and studied indices, back in 1980. If you were to fall asleep for the next twenty years, you would probably have been very pleasantly surprised when you woke up and checked your brokerage statement.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of how good that surprise would be, we've excerpted the chart below from an excellent review of risk management practices published by Sloane's former colleagues at the CFA Institute Research Foundation. This shows the market's returns on a logarithmic scale, which shows exponential growth much more clearly than the linear charts you might be more familiar with.</p>
<p>You don't have to worry too much about those math words though: we've included this chart to convey that there is a clear pattern of gradual ascent in long-term stock returns. Just look how the line goes from bottom left to top right!</p>
<figure>

<p>So, if stock market returns are historically consistent, why is the stock market risky?</p>
<p>One could easily write a PhD thesis on this topic, and many people have. It's complicated! But our goal in this essay is to leave you with a well-grounded understanding of how stocks behave, and it's possible to get there without resorting to pursuing a graduate degree.</p>
<p>If you look at the chart above, you can see that returns oscillated between flat and negative for more than a decade after the year 2000. The 1970s were similarly non-wonderful times to own stocks. These things have happened, and likely will happen again!</p>
<p>But the important thing to remember is that they also usually stop happening eventually. And when they do, stocks' long-term tendency to appreciate has historically returned in force. So there are significant practical rewards to adopting a patient posture that embraces this reality.</p>
<p>That's true in triplicate when you zoom in to consider what might happen in any given year. The chart below shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index - the same one we examined above - has declined an average of 14.3% at some point in each of the last 43 years.</p>
<p>Those declines are shown in red on the chart below, but they're only half of the story. The grey bars on the same chart show the returns for each full year. And despite some sort of decline occurring like clockwork every single year, the stock market managed to notch a positive performance almost three quarters of the time.</p>
<figure>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At this point, it's probably beginning to make a lot of sense why stocks are usually seen of the cornerstone of a long-term investment portfolio: if you can ignore, indulge, or otherwise plan for their volatility, they have an extremely well-documented tendency to turn money into more money.</p>
<p>We'll get back to bonds in a second, but before we go there, let's just lay out what we learned in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stocks go down at some point every single year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They still managed to finish the year up about 75% of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To capture these returns, stay invested!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But is this really all that different from the way bonds behave? After all, many people we talk to aren't particularly motivated by extracting every last iota of investment return from the market. They just want to live their lives with a reasonable sense that when they need money sometime in the future, there will be enough of it.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-stocks-compare-to-bonds-and-other-assets"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#how-do-stocks-compare-to-bonds-and-other-assets">How do Stocks Compare to Bonds and Other Assets?</a></h3>
<p>The book <em><a href="https://wsp.wharton.upenn.edu/book/stocks-for-the-long-run/">Stocks for the Long Run</a></em> by Wharton professor Jeremy J. Siegel is perhaps the most widely referenced study of long-term investment returns. It's worth a read for anyone serious about learning the craft of investing, but we bring it up here mostly because it also contains the excellent chart below.</p>
<figure>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart shows something remarkable in stark clarity: <strong>increasing our holding period decreases our range of outcomes.</strong></p>
<p>Over the period Siegel studied - which begins in 1802 - stock performance was extremely variable in the short term. An investor who held a diversified stock portfolio for one year at any point during those centuries might have experienced a gain as large as 67%, a decline as stark as 39%, or anything in between those two values.</p>
<p>But as we move our eyes across the chart to the right and examine a longer holding period, the difference between the best and worst return narrows significantly.</p>
<p>After thirty years, the difference between the best and worst annualized return was only about 8%. So even if you were to pick the literal worst time in the past two centuries to put money into the stock market, there is a strong statistical argument that you would come out ahead with enough patience, planning, and preparedness.</p>
<h3 id="should-i-expect-similar-returns-from-an-ethical-capital-portfolio"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/05/06/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect-when-youre-investing/#should-i-expect-similar-returns-from-an-ethical-capital-portfolio">Should I Expect Similar Returns from an Ethical Capital Portfolio?</a></h3>
<p>We hate to conclude a fact-laden exploration like this with uncertainty, but it bears mentioning that <strong>the way we invest is nothing if not unusual</strong>.</p>
<p>We are proud of this, and <strong>it's not going to change</strong>.</p>
<p>The people who are best suited to working with us are generally unsettled by the thought of investing in an index like the S&amp;P 500, which contains (among other things) many prolific carbon emitters, weapons manufacturers, and organizers of industrial-scale animal slaughter.</p>
<p>We'd rather be punched in the face than have any involvement with those activities.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, a lot of our time is spent trying to insulate the portfolios we manage from an ever-growing list of product and conduct-based issues. In our view, this is likely to mitigate risk and promote adherence to <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">our process</a>, which has remained remarkably consistent since Sloane founded this firm in 2021.</p>
<p>But again, <strong>we do things differently around here.</strong> If the thought of your portfolio behaving differently from your neighbor's is scary to you, it's likely you will be better off working with a different firm. If that thought makes you queasy, it's probably worth evaluating <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/">our strategies</a> or <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">reaching out to our team</a>.</p>

<p>We might be in the midst of a recession right now.</p>
<p>I say that because measures of real-time economic activity have slumped significantly this year. As I write, the Atlanta Fed's <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow">GDPNow model</a> is forecasting that the United States' GDP fell by 2.1 percent.</p>
<p>We can't know for sure if this will come to pass until the official data is released later this summer, but people are already worried about it. Google <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=recession">search volume for the word "recession"</a> is already higher than it was in 2008, and the mainstream press is starting to write about slowing economic activity with some regularity.</p>
<p>It's natural to wonder what this means. After all, most people assume that a recession is one of the most significant risks to their savings. There is certainly truth to that. The S&amp;P 500 is down almost 20% so far this year, and it's likely that many investors have experienced similar declines in the value of their holdings.</p>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>No-one can say with certainty how the rest of the year will unfold. But this is a profound opportunity to learn from history because this isn't the first time that the US economy has slowed down. The National Bureau of Economic Research maintains a handy <a href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating">database</a> of prior instances and we spent some time examining it for indications of how the future might unfold.</p>
<p>One crucial thing to understand is that no-one rings a bell at the onset of a recession. They are generally only recognized in retrospect, when economists can confidently identify peaks and troughs in economic activity.</p>
<p>The chart below is meant to illustrate one of the most important practical implications of this: <strong>by the time an official recession determination is announced, the recession is usually over</strong>. The grey bars indicate recessionary periods and the purple bars indicate when those recessions were announced.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/CleanShot-2024-05-23-at-17.37.14.png"/></p>
<p>Buying stocks during the month a recession was announced generated an average return of 16.19% one year later.</p>
<p>But much more importantly, remaining committed to one's long-term plan allowed investors to experience the profound growth that unfolded over the subsequent decades. Even terrifying periods like 2008's great recession were no match for patience and the power of compounding.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on what matters</strong></p>
<p>The real risk of a recession is that it will scare us into making suboptimal financial choices like staying away from the stock market, selling our existing holdings, and buying expensive "protection" from further market declines.</p>
<p>These mistakes can be immensely seductive! I've got no doubt that there is someone making slick tiktok videos right now about complex trading strategies that purport to preserve the value of portfolios no matter what happens in the market. Your best bet is to ignore these, because they have a way of shifting focus away from what matters: your long-term investment objectives.</p>
<p>Families, individuals, and institutions often forget that the simple act of centering these goals produces a profound sense of strategic clarity. In many cases, the money we manage is meant to meet goals that won't materialize for more than thirty years.</p>
<p>That's roughly the entire amount of time shown in the chart above! It can be hard to picture yourself that far into the future, but it's worth a try. Because by then, you'll have almost no recollection of today's fears, just a sense of gratitude to your past self for sticking with the plan.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/">Why We Need A New Food System Now</a></h2>
<p>Today's supply chain snafus might be setting the stage for a broader, more complex catastrophe in the global food system. The availability of potash, phosphate, and fossil fuel derived agricultural inputs that we rely upon to feed earth's growing populations has already been materially reduced, and these stresses could take as long as 3-5 years to resolve.</p>
<p>The timeline comes from to <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterZeihan">Peter Zeihan</a>, an analyst I've been following for close to a decade for his sharp views on geopolitics, energy, and international trade. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeihanonGeopolitics">His YouTube channel</a> is free, and has been illuminating during Russia's recent war of aggression, so I took the opportunity to dig a little deeper into how his views intersect with something that should be of interest to everyone on the planet: our food system.</p>
<p>He would probably want me to underscore one point at the outset of this exploration: <strong>modern agriculture is an industrial process</strong>. It's true that regenerative approaches are growing in popularity, but at the moment only about 5.5 million of the United States' roughly 900 million acres of farmland is certified organic. That's well under one percent.</p>
<p>So as a practical matter, synthetic fertilizers are currently supporting about half of the world's population.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the world population that our current food system can support with and without synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Approximately half of the people on earth rely on unsustainable synthetic fertilizers to survive. " src="images/world-population-with-and-without-fertilizer-1024x723.png"/></p>
<p>The chart above is stark enough before we pause to consider that supply chain disruptions (and the most acute threats to food security) are not evenly distributed around the world.</p>
<p>North America is unique in that we have plentiful sources of potash, phosphate, and natural gas in close proximity to our midwestern "breadbasket." Only a few other places in the world are so fortunate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eighty percent of global potash production comes from Canada, China, Belarus, or Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China, Morocco, and the United States produce two thirds of the world's phosphate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Russia and the United States are the world's two largest producers of natural gas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed that Russia featured twice in that list. Both Mr. Putin's Petrostate and allied Belarus are now subject to sanctions, which effectively takes a non-trivial portion of the market offline.</p>
<p>It's too soon to tell what this will mean exactly, but just a few days ago the Interim Chief Executive of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/canadas-nutrien-sees-possible-prolonged-global-fertilizer-disruption-russia-2022-03-01/">Nutrien, the world's biggest fertilizer producer, said</a> "We are going to run our plants. Run them flat out. Could we see interruptions in exports out of Russia? Yes. Can we see plant closures? We could."</p>
<p>Such a disruption would be poorly timed, since the northern hemisphere's temperate agricultural regions will be in the full bloom of spring before too long. And fertilizer only works if you put it on the plants before they grow. So in the short term we're left hoping that these shipments can make it to their destinations.</p>
<h5 id="the-food-system-is-unsustainable-at-best"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/#the-food-system-is-unsustainable-at-best">The Food System is Unsustainable at Best</a></h5>
<p>Of course, it bears mentioning that <strong>none of this is remotely sustainable</strong>.</p>
<p>For one thing, potash, phosphate, and fossil fuels are not renewable. They need to be extracted, transported, refined, and then transported again to reach their final destinations.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, they also have an unfortunate tendency to leach into groundwater and literally strangle waterways with out-of-control algal blooms. But even if those negative effects could be contained, farmers would still need to keep spending substantial sums re-applying these treatments every year. And their soil wouldn't be any better off after all of the expense and complexity involved.</p>
<p>Farmers will do their best to adapt. Some might stop planting corn in favor of soy, which needs less fertilizer to grow than conventional cultivation methods. They might even take steps towards adopting regenerative practices by using manure in place of expensive fertilizers.</p>
<p>But that won't help the folks in the global south who are already facing food insecurity.</p>
<p><img alt="Inequality in per capita calorie intake in 2020 by country. This shows that the global south is profoundly more exposed to disruptions in food supply than the rich world. " src="images/coefficient-of-variation-cv-in-per-capita-caloric-intake-1-1024x723.png"/></p>
<p>It's hard to pinpoint where on the planet these pressures will manifest, but one can safely and sadly assume that the darkest-tinted countries in the map above are set to carry most of the weight.</p>
<p>This is a policy choice. And delaying our adaptation leaves many vulnerable populations around the world needlessly exposed to famine.</p>
<p>Even if we were to forget how to make synthetic fertilizer, we could still adapt our agricultural system to feed everybody on earth and entirely mitigate the risk of famine by phasing out animal agriculture. This <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets">would free up 75-400% of the land currently in agricultural use</a> (depending on the way you measure), substantially reduce humanity's carbon footprint, and prevent billions of living, thinking creatures from experiencing needless suffering.</p>
<p>It would also create a much more resilient economy, since we wouldn't have to worry about geopolitical tensions spilling over into famine with the same sort of urgency. The expensive, complicated, and non-renewable inputs that are pushing us towards that extreme situation this time around would be replaced by manure and compost, which can be generated locally.</p>
<h5 id="can-we-accelerate-this-transition"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/#can-we-accelerate-this-transition">Can We Accelerate This Transition?</a></h5>
<p>We can sure try. But it will be a complex undertaking, and it's important to make sure that you've given yourself the space and support to take on this kind of challenge. True change starts from within, so this can be as simple as making an authentic commitment to try your best and follow any resulting instincts.</p>
<p>If you do only that, I believe it can make a world of difference. After all, that's basically how I wound up starting this firm, which has allowed me to help others build financial security for themselves by aligning their capital with companies that are driving positive change in the world.</p>
<p>A little more than 16% of our flagship investment strategy is invested in companies that are making our food system a little bit better and more resilient every day. They do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making low-cost loans available to family farmers and sustainable electric cooperatives,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuing cutting-edge research into synthetic biology, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing early-stage capital to the next generation of agriculture and food-tech startups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's very, very cool that we're able to make a professionally managed portfolio of companies like these available to almost anyone who can open an American brokerage account, regardless of how much money they have available to invest.</p>
<p>But I hope to compound my firm's impact even further by sharing our thoughts openly and regularly through missives like this one. If you've enjoyed it, <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">say so!</a> I would love to hear from you.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-inflation-mean-to-you"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/">What Does Inflation Mean to You?</a></h2>
<p>Inflation has been an obscure economic phenomenon for most of my life. There has been plenty of academic discussion, but it hasn't crossed over into mainstream economic and political discourse.</p>
<p>Until recently.</p>
<p>Pandemic-induced supply chain shocks have coupled with Russia's war of aggression and the associated volatility in world energy markets to put it front and center in "kitchen table" economic discussions.</p>
<p>Which is a polite way of saying that people are worried about it.</p>
<p>I can see why.</p>
<p>Traditionally, analysts ignore inflation in energy and food prices (which are quite volatile) and focus on "core inflation" which is designed to measure the other stuff in our day to day life. Things like medical care, apparel, education, and services.</p>
<p>As the chart below from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm">United States Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> shows, those prices have spiked after almost two decades of stability.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/12-month-percentage-chan-1024x761.png"/></p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>And more importantly, how can we expect it to manifest in the broader economy?</p>
<p>There is no shortage of scary stories about the ravages of inflation. Countries like Zimbabwe, Argentina, and Turkey have been indelibly shaped by it for most of the period shown in the chart above. We've heard of people who make a habit of going to the grocery store first thing in the morning because prices increase every afternoon and princes made into paupers by the mass devaluation of currency.</p>
<p>Is that what we have to look forward to?</p>
<p>At a high level, <strong>I don't think so.</strong></p>
<p>And I think that the general discussion about inflation in our economy has obscured some basic questions of fairness that should be of interest to anyone with a progressive political bent. But I want to make sure that we're all on the same page. So let's clarify some terms before we dive into what we can reasonably expect in the future.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#what-is-inflation">What is inflation?</a></h3>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines inflation as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not so complex! Prices up, value of money down. But a declining value of money doesn't exactly create warm and fuzzy feelings in anyone's hearts. Instead, it tends to create panic, since most people aren't used to thinking of the dollars in their wallet as something that fluctuates in value.</p>
<p>That's because unless you're sending money overseas, traveling, or making a big-ticket purchase from another country, fluctuations in the value of the dollar don't mean very much to you. They show up in the price of things you buy day-to-day, but generally speaking the fluctuations outside of food and energy prices are digested by the time they reach you that you barely perceive them.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-inflation-measured"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#how-is-inflation-measured">How is inflation measured?</a></h3>
<p>In the United States, the benchmark measure of inflation is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They've created a metric called the <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong>, which is designed to measure the prices that consumers pay for certain goods and services.</p>
<p>It's important to underline that we're talking about consumers as a whole here, not you in particular. For instance, vegans have generally been insulated by recent rises in the price of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. So our personal experiences of inflation may be quite different from what's described in the CPI.</p>
<p>That's doubly true for folks who live outside of big cities. The CPI is designed to measure price changes for urban consumers, and doesn't generally do a good job tracking the experiences of people in Rural America who often have lower incomes, greater day-to-day reliance on oil and gas, and labor markets that are slower to adjust for rising wages.</p>
<h3 id="is-inflation-good-or-bad"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#is-inflation-good-or-bad">Is inflation good or bad?</a></h3>
<p>Inflation is just one component of our economic ecosystem, which makes it difficult to analyze in isolation. With that said, many economic commentators have not hesitated to characterize it as a scourge. That's because it reduces the value of certain assets, like cash held in bank accounts, in a way that's quite scary to seniors and other folks who live on fixed incomes.</p>
<p>But it also creates jobs. It's not a coincidence that inflation is flaring up at the same time as the US unemployment rate is drawing closer to pre-pandemic levels. This relationship is so central to our economy that the US Federal Reserve's mandate is to promote both "maximum employment" and "stable prices."</p>
<p>This effectively acknowledges a direct link between the recent "great resignation" which has featured all sorts of employees leaving their jobs for better pay, more flexibility, or long-term career opportunities and the rise we've seen in inflation rates. One begets the other. So it would be quite difficult to issue an accurate blanket characterization of it as good or bad because at some level, it's both.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem to stop people.</p>
<p>There seems to be an army of right-wing zealots ready to pounce on every inflation-related datapoint in an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the long-term stability of our economy. In many cases, these pundits have been making the same case for years without regard to the evidence. And in my judgment, you would be well served by ignoring them. A well-diversified portfolio of stocks (such as the sort that we build for our clients) is widely seen as the best way to preserve the value of your wealth over long time horizons.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-relationship-between-debt-and-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#whats-the-relationship-between-debt-and-inflation">What's the relationship between debt and inflation?</a></h3>
<p>The mainstream discussion about inflation tends to overlook something crucial: many Americans are in significant amounts of debt. I'm talking less about mortgages here than credit cards, student loans, and medical debts that often come with high interest rates and target some of our poorest populations.</p>
<p>This probably doesn't come as news, since at this point almost everyone has a friend or loved one that has been touched by this personally. A recent <em>Liberty Street Economics</em> <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/11/uneven-distribution-of-household-debt-by-gender-race-and-education/">analysis</a> published by the New York Federal Reserve found that Black, Hispanic, and Female college graduates were much more likely than other graduates to still be carrying student loan debt at age thirty.</p>
<p>This means that those graduates effectively had their earnings reduced by the cost of carrying their student loan debt. And because inflation reduces the cost of paying back those debts, its recent rise may wind up reducing the burden that these borrowers are set to bear in the coming years.</p>
<p>Of course, it's nothing compared to just cancelling the loans outright or enacting broader-scale economic justice reforms. But we'll have to leave those topics for another time. Feel free to reach out to us if you don't feel like waiting, though.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-best-way-to-protect-my-assets-from-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#whats-the-best-way-to-protect-my-assets-from-inflation"><strong>What's the best way to protect my assets from inflation?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Most well-diversified portfolios are designed to protect the value of your assets over time, but some do a better job of that than others. As a general rule, companies with strong pricing power are the best situated to navigate an extended inflationary environment. Investments in tangible assets, like real estate and infrastructure, should also be expected to hold up well.</p>
<p>The strategies we manage here are designed with this in mind, and tend to hold larger-than-average concentrations of real estate and electric utilities. Our due diligence <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">process</a> also evaluates a company's degree of pricing power, which is a fancy way of saying that we take inflation extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Anyone concerned with inflation should also consider owning some I Bonds. Issued by the US Treasury, these are special savings bonds that automatically adjust their interest rates to account for inflation. That means that whether inflation rises or falls, you can rest assured that your I bond holdings will retain their purchasing power.</p>
<p>The primary drawback with I Bonds is that you can only purchase $15,000 worth of them in each calendar year. They also withhold a few months of interest if you sell the bonds within five years of purchase, but the yields are so much better than most other savings products that they are still a compelling option for many use cases.
