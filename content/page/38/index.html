<h2 id="minyan-makes-markets-manageable"><a class="toclink" href="../../2009/04/21/minyan-makes-markets-manageable/">Minyan Makes Markets Manageable</a></h2>
<p><em>This is from a paper I wrote at the College of Idaho.</em></p>
<p>Minyanville.com made it possible for me to be conversant about financial issues. </p>
<p>I remember discovering the site about two weeks into my first internship on Wall Street. I had been tasked with monitoring a status screen and told to continually read the news to help my own understanding. When I first started attempting to understand the machination of the Wall Street beat by reading the New York Times business section and Reuters financial news, I felt like I was drowning.  </p>
<p>My parents (both corporate finance geeks) had taught me phrases like EBITDA and revenue at a young age. My friends assumed I knew about these things, and would sometimes ask me questions about investment banking, trading, or business; assuming me to be an authority because I knew the names of more than five Wall Street firms.</p>
<p>I found Minyanville by chance, and found Todd Harrison’s writing there to be immensely helpful to my understanding. At first it was just his writing, but as I started exploring the site and tenaciously checking for updates, I found a collection of authors and thinkers who had devoted themselves to the craft of finance and were willing to share their experiences.</p>
<p>Imagine me, eighteen years old, essentially dropping in like a fly on the wall and listening to a collection of the “cool kids” in the finance world talk about their craft with one another and an audience of thousands.  I was fortunate to both sit down with and chat over the phone with Todd (Toddo) recently, and he shared with me some musings about both the reasons for Minyanville’s existence and the way that the general public interacts with the financial media.</p>
<p>The Minyanville approach of providing opinion rather than advice comes clear after I ask Toddo if anyone actually understands the financial machination. He responds “To understand where we are we must appreciate how we got here. So I think that looking at the probability spectrum of what could occur and communicating the risks and rewards to all of the scenarios within a probability spectrum and offering an opinion in the context that it’s just that (an opinion) is the greatest value add in the market place, as opposed to telling people what to do.”</p>
<p>Indeed many have long been critical of those who offer advice to random audiences rather than opinions. In person, it’s clear that Harrison believes there’s very little merit in offering advice over the internet, since there is absolutely no way he could know the risk profile of his readership. Further to the point of offering advice without information he offers “I think that’s endemic of the mindset that got us into trouble in the first place.”</p>
<p>Harrison offers that people should re-examine who they look to for their punditry, arguing that “Many of the pundits that people are looking to for questions on when we’re going to get out of this are the same people who didn’t see I coming in the first place.” This jives very well with a thought passed on by a friend in the asset management industry who offered that oftentimes, once people are validated as pundits in the media mainstream that it’s very difficult to get rid of them. Indeed pundits who offered up investment recommendations that failed miserably one month are often back the next recommending new investments with little accountability for their past failings.</p>
<p>On the subject of criticizing unaccountable pundits, there’s not much more I can offer. There’s already a closet industry built around criticizing CNBC. A point Toddo raises which I think is very thoughtful is that “There is a fair amount of culpability that extends throughout the societal spectrum. (It ranges) from the consumers who overextended on their credit to the financial institutions that engineered the markets to the policymakers who were complicit by acceptance to the CEO of the United States of America.” He adds “Nobody was asking questions when the screens were green.”</p>
<p>Harrison is hesitant to point out too bluntly that he and many other Minyans were asking questions when the screens were green. It’s been a good thing for me to have these guys as teachers, and to have their thoughts percolating in my brain.</p>

<h2 id="the-greening-of-campus"><a class="toclink" href="../../2009/04/04/the-greening-of-campus/">The Greening of Campus</a></h2>
<p><em>This is a profile I wrote for Quest Magazine at the College of Idaho.</em> </p>
<p>After a record oil price spike, Quest sits down with Andy Erstad, principal at Erstad Architects in Boise to discuss the College, the future, and the state of environmental building.</p>
<p>Construction fences and equipment have been sprouting up around campus so far this year. With the remodel of Simplot completed and the remodel of Hayman underway, it’s beginning to look like a much newer campus.  Andy Erstad is one particular charioteer of change: “I’m excited that the school has taken a very proactive approach to upgrades and management of resources that go into operating the facilities.”</p>
<p>There have certainly been exogenous factors in the campus’ push towards sustainability. Erstad posits that “The run-up in the cost of energy really highlighted the potential beneficial outcomes of being smart and doing conscientious smart planning both in master planning of the campus facilities and in the actual building design and implementation.” There are real costs associated with operating a campus, especially, laboratory buildings and science buildings. According to Erstad, “the costs are doubling”.</p>
<p>The seeds of sustainable practices have been germinating for a long time, however. Erstad notes that “you have this sort of industry movement already going on and then you have this exclamation point of a very real energy spike (cost spike).” The benefits of building new buildings or renovating existing ones are often more than simply aesthetic. Erstad thinks “people started to say ‘Wow, you know we’ve been hearing about this all these years, now we get to see the real impact of it.’ And where a building designed and built fifteen years ago may cost a hundred thousand dollars a year to run in energy and utility costs. That same building built today may take fifty-five or fifty thousand dollars to run.”</p>
<p>Aesthetics and experiences do matter though, and Erstad believes that there are habits that can change to both assist us fiscally but also to improve our relationships with the land. One such way is “Utilizing [campus as an] outside living classroom if you will. And that type of approach while it’s very sustainable and green…is also a fabulous teaching tool to bring college students, faculty, and staff in line or aware of their environment and aware of opportunities to be stewards of the land and stewards of the facilities.”</p>
<p>There are certainly financial constraints involved in bringing the college forward and more towards sustainable practices. Erstad notes that “you couldn’t really take every single building and afford to do a complete sustainability overhaul…on each of them due to cost. As the college is looking at upgrading and making improvements to various buildings, they are seizing these opportunities to do the right thing. Increase the efficiencies, add different types of lighting: The new lighting technologies, the new energy management technologies, and the new heating and air conditioning technologies where they can.”  The college has been particularly forward-looking in this according to Erstad, who notes “as every opportunity arises the College has been taking those situations and trying to increase the energy efficiency, increase the mechanical and electrical efficiencies, get a leg up wherever they can.”</p>
<p>Erstad is happy to share his enthusiasm for the way that the college has handled its campus. “They’re seriously focused on doing the right thing…I appreciate that mindful of the budgets and the cost implications I think it’s still the right thing to do….In the long run, the savings are tremendous, and particularly in college buildings, classroom facilities, science laboratories which have a huge energy consumption component. This Is one of the ways that the school takes a very responsible role in leveraging every dollar that they have to the highest possible extent.”</p>

<p><em>Tim Rayment was kind enough to grant me an e-mail interview for my journalism class at the College of Idaho. <a href="http://www.volumespreadanalysis.com/Images/Tim%20Rayment%20Article.pdf" title="Link: http://www.volumespreadanalysis.com/Images/Tim%20Rayment%20Article.pdf">He went on to win the 2009 Forex Trading World Cup</a> that year in addition to writing a number of features for the Sunday Times of London. Two months after we spoke, he <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/joseph-cassano-the-man-with-the-trillion-dollar-price-on-his-head-qtmmnz8mjph">published one</a> with a nice vignette about my dad.</em> </p>
<p><em>At the beginning of this conversation, he shared an anecdote with me about informally advising an actress on when to swap currencies while she sold a house in France and bought one in England.</em> </p>
<p><strong>To look at the example of the actress that you mentioned, it seems as if there doesn't seem to be much of anything that can get her to look at news rationally except for somehow making her into some form of trader. Is doing this as simple as involving former bankers and hedgers in the news media, or are there other steps that you would recommend be taken?</strong></p>
<p>Turning her into a trader wasn't difficult. I told her how she would feel before she felt it.</p>
<p>I explained that the panic she would experience in a few days' time was part of the process by which markets work, and that she had to endure feeling sick with anxiety before she could be rewarded with higher prices -- and that there was another actress, or at least another human being, who was going through the same emotions in mirror image while trying to achieve the opposite transaction, i.e., one who wished to sell a house in England and to buy one in France, while our actress wished to buy a house in England and sell one in France. </p>
<p>The actress panicked when she was supposed to, despite being prepared for what would happen. But she trusted the explanation enough to wait. Each day I gave her price levels that would mean all was well, and price levels that would mean all was not. She watched the markets on her laptop, not daring to go out. In the end, I think she actually enjoyed the experience, because it gave her an understanding and a feeling of control. And she got her price.</p>
<p><strong>As a follow up, how might one avoid the "Cramer Problem", where a former hedge fund manager makes the transition to being a journalist, but gives wide-ranging advice that is more designed to entertain than enlighten? Do journalistic organizations seeking to overcome this problem simply need to ignore the "Mad Money" audience? Can they do this and remain solvent?</strong></p>
<p>I can't speak for CNBC, but in British broadsheet newspapers, the desire to entertain has been met in more wholesome ways. </p>
<p>The Money section of The Sunday Times, for example, probably gives as much space to publicising the scams of banks and of financial companies as it does to investment themes, so that the reader is "entertained" by being made to feel angry. Arguably there is a strong public-interest justification in these stories. </p>
<p>This is not a phenomenon of the credit crisis, by the way: the Money section, which -- unlike the Business section -- is aimed at a general audience, has always been quite sceptical. It's probably one-third to one-half investment advice, and one-third consumer advice, while a sixth of the section entertains readers by, for example, interviewing a celebrity about the most satisfying moments and the biggest mistakes in their personal finances. There's also a columnist who is mean with money, and happens to be married to someone he loves but regards as profligate. He's always saving cash; she's always spending it. It's quite funny.</p>
<p><strong>Coming from the standpoint of protecting investors from hazy information that they might receive, could you support conceptually the establishment of a test to see who was capable of trading individual stocks and bonds (as distinct from vanilla mutual funds)? Can you think of anything that you would want to put on such a test?</strong></p>
<p>Such a test might have perverse consequences. </p>
<p>If you require people to pass a test before they can trade, you drive them into the arms of professionals, who might perform no better (but charge fees for the privilege). For those who pass the test, the danger is false confidence. Where would you draw the line? Would you ask a tenant to pass a test before allowing them to buy a house, for example?</p>
<p>I can see a case for requiring a test before trading on margin, however. It's leverage that destroys lives.</p>
<p><strong>Is improving the quality of financial journalism more a question of improving the quality of reportage at the highest levels by involving experts or instead one of improving the level of discourse at the lowest level to educate a greater number of market participants? If you were the editor of a business section and had to choose which of these two to emphasize, which would it be? Why?</strong></p>
<p>It would be both. </p>
<p>I'd start by hiring reporters who understand companies, economies and the markets. Without that, you've got no business section and without a business section you don't have a proper newspaper. So, an editor has to give that priority. Then I'd establish a separate section, similar to the Sunday Times Money section, to educate the widest audience. By having two sections, you can publish material for a sophisticated audience in the Business section without intimidating the general audience. The two constituencies are equally important. Finally, I'd save some money from my budget to hire hedgies and ex-bankers as business columnists. These are columnists, not reporters. If there were no money left in the pot, I'd persuade them to do it for nothing (but they would not be allowed to "talk their book"). </p>
<p>Their job is to educate the sophisticated audience (in the Business, not the Money section) with real-time analysis from a trader's viewpoint, because traders think differently from reporters.</p>
<p><strong>When you were a "budding" trader, how did you navigate the transition from amateur to professional? What resources did you utilize? Are there ways you can conceive of to make these resources publicly available?</strong></p>
<p>That's a long story. </p>
<p>There are thousands of legitimate ways to trade, and would-be traders face a quest to find what is right for them. In the end, I took some academic work from the 1930s, which I came across by chance, and combined it with profit-driven work on technical analysis in the 1990s. Then I adapted both to suit the way my mind works. Much of the trading literature remains useful for generations, because it is not really about trading at all. It's about human nature, which does not change.</p>
<p>Trading is mostly control of your own psychology. And I've spent thousands of hours working out how to reduce the subjective to the binary, so that decisions can be as objective as possible.</p>
<p>I've also been very lucky in that I have good mentors. My advice would be to find good mentors and to do your best to outgrow them. At the same time, try to remove all ego from the trading process.</p>
<p>There's valuable work in the trading literature, but you need to overcome human frailty to use it. That's a lifelong task</p>

<h2 id="the-social-media"><a class="toclink" href="../../2009/03/16/the-social-media/">The Social Media</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this in my second semester at the College of Idaho. It was originally untitled, but my irony-free usage of "The Social Media" in it made the right title obvious in retrospect.</em> </p>
<p>Media pundits often speak breathlessly about the ongoing democratization of our world because of the increasing involvement of the “Joe the plumbers” of the world. The phenomenon through which they have come to be involved has been referred to as “grassroots” or “citizen” journalism: a process by which citizens are actively involved in the creation and editing of online news stories through the ability to comment, filter, and create/share substantially anything they want. </p>
<p>I have participated in this phenomenon through “social media” websites like Digg.com and Reddit.com, where I have long been voting on stories in an effort to collaborate with my fellow users to bring the stories most relevant to our microcosm of society to the front page. The intersection of opinions about what news is most relevant can lead to interesting problems.</p>
<p>When I first got started using the social media, it was through digg.com, which was at that time a relatively small community of likeminded users. I found the vast majority of the news stories to be relevant because its combination of important social news and irreverent internet jokes appealed to the eighteen year old, slightly pimplier version of me.</p>
<p>Digg.com started to become less appealing to me as its user base started to grow unwieldy. Since Digg’s user structure depends on users discussing and voting on issues for one front page. There is only one front page, so the interests of the community must be quite relevant to one another in order to give a relevant experience to the whole userbase. As the site continually grew, the friendly community of eighteen year old boys laughing at funny pictures of animals and learning about the Austrian school of economics swiftly became an online red light district. With each incremental user, Digg took a step down an inexorable path to become an Obama/Ron Paul/repetitive joke machine.  I started to grow dissatisfied as Digg grew into an online times square: a big place so actively purporting to be hip that one cannot help but be repulsed.</p>
<p>As my revulsion grew, I began looking for sites which had similar functionality but a method to control the overwhelming number of users on a site. After much searching, I found reddit.com, a site which allows the user to subscribe to various news feeds in specific subject areas. The website then concatenates those various news feeds into a single feed, which effectively displays a great deal of information that is relevant to my interests, while still being edited by a small group of relatively sane individuals.</p>
<p>This forum allows for both insightful and irreverent discussion of the articles, as well as an ability to comment on Reddit rather than the underlying site in order to discuss the story in a more back-and-forth way than by simply posting a reaction on the website and seeing what happens. The reddit/digg manner of interaction also allows for the posting of “anti-news”, as in the revelation of irresponsible coverage of news reporting or the non-coverage of an event.</p>
<p>The social media has helped me not just because it steers me towards “the best” article in any particular news cycle, but also because it has the capability to bring stories to our attention that would not normally find themselves headline news on network TV: stories like a group of anonymous internet users collaborating online to catch a pedophile, or the Pope’s continuing non-action in sending condoms to Africa. The sites mix funny news with real news and real chat in the comments, in a way that makes them palatable and fun to consume.</p>
