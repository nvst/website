<h2 id="the-chart-that-breaks-capitalism"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/07/29/the-chart-that-breaks-capitalism/">The Chart That Breaks Capitalism</a></h2>
<p>As I write this, US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and the Fed's Board of Governors are ensconced in another two-day meeting. As with past sessions of the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm" title="Link: http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">Federal Open Market Committee</a>, they will make a statement at the end. That statement will either move markets or bore them, but as a professional investor I will be waiting for exactly one thing: certainty about the path interest rates will take.</p>
<p>You're supposed to laugh at that line. It's more likely I'll be tapped to be the new lead singer of One Direction than the Fed will tell us exactly what it's going to do. But I'd settle for Yellen and company just narrowing the range of projections they're offering a little bit.</p>
<p>I was privileged to be in attendance at the <a href="http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/events/Pages/07202015_104532.aspx">60th Annual Financial Analysts Seminar (FAS)</a> last week in Chicago, where <a href="https://www.pimco.com/experts/marc-p-seidner" title="Link: https://www.pimco.com/experts/marc-p-seidner">PIMCO's Marc Seidner</a> got straight to the point in his presentation: The dots aren't adding up. His first slide came from the Summary of Economic Projections of the most recently released Federal Open Market Committee meeting <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150617.pdf" title="Link: http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150617.pdf">minutes</a>. It's a bunch of dots. Here it is:</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Appropriate Pace of Policy Firming: Midpoint of Target Range or Target Level for the Federal Funds Rate</strong>
<img alt="Appropriate Pace of Policy Firming Midpoint of Target Range or Target Level for the Federal Funds Rate" src="images/Appropriate-pace-of-policy-firming-Midpoint-of-target-range-or-target-level-for-the-federal-funds-rate.png?resize=640%2C356"/></p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150617.pdf">The US Federal Reserve</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>According to Seidner, each dot shows where a voting member of the committee expects rates to be at the end of the calendar year in question.</p>
<p><strong>You See the Problem, Right?</strong></p>
<p>If this chart is being offered as an answer to the question, "What do you guys think is going to happen with interest rates over the long term?" the answer that we are being left with is "lol, I dunno."</p>
<p>Just think about it. The span of projections given for the end of 2016 range from a little under 50 basis points all the way up to more than 2.75%. The US 10-year Treasury bond closed <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5ETNX+Interactive#%7B%22range%22:%221mo%22,%22allowChartStacking%22:true%7D">Monday yielding 2.23%</a>, which means there is literally an entire 10-year Treasury bond's-worth of yield between the low and high end of the forecast range.</p>
<p>It's convenient that the same degree of uncertainty doesn't exist about "longer term" interest rates: We are clearly being told to think of them as gravitating towards the 3.25%–4.25% range. But anybody who has spent time in investment markets can tell you that the long term can take a long time to materialize.</p>
<p>The Fed seems to be saying the same thing.</p>
<p>So to practitioners who are active in the market now, there's a straightforward question: What do you do? My colleague Jason Voss, CFA, has drawn attention to "<a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/06/15/the-little-worm-that-is-destroying-capitalism/" title="Link: http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/06/15/the-little-worm-that-is-destroying-capitalism/">The Little Worm That Is Destroying Capitalism</a>," but we need to do more than stay away from companies with lazy capital budgeting processes.</p>
<p><strong>We Need an Interest Rate to Value Stuff With</strong></p>
<p>And we don't really have one. Or at least so it seems. Most investors should still be using discount rates that reflect what they expect to see over the lifetime of their investments, and I really hope that most people making active allocations have a time horizon of more than 18 months in mind. So perhaps it's worth examining your process a bit if you find yourself wondering when Janet Yellen is going to fix your discounted cash flow (DCF) model.</p>
<p>But with that said, the market has a mind of its own. And this Federal Reserve Board’s approach to normalizing policy may make it a more productive strategy than usual to pay attention to market-oriented forecasts instead of trying to read the tea leaves too closely. Indeed, <a href="http://www.arborresearch.com/bianco/?page_id=46890">Jim Bianco of Bianco Research</a> argued in an earlier presentation that the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates until the hike is priced in. To make our lives simpler, he suggested that we all check the CME Group’s <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=print&amp;utm_campaign=CTA-Intelligence-advert">FedWatch</a> and go about our business. In case you’re wondering, yesterday the near-month contract was trading with an implied 0% probability of a rate hike, albeit on close to no volume. The market right now has a 91% probability on a hike, but that may be static as trading in the contract comes to a close.</p>
<p>But the importance of the Fed seemed straightforward to all who were in attendance at the FAS. At least five of the sessions focused on the path that this esteemed group of 12 technocrats would chart for the global economy. But at least a part of me wonders how much agency they have in the matter. Speaker Vivian Lau, formerly of Serengeti Asset Management, argued that 70% of central banks around the world are easing right now. We (as the market) are focused on the one in Washington, DC, though.</p>
<p>Is that because it’s really the most important? Or just because it’s the closest?</p>
<p>I have to wonder if it’s the latter. Though the phrase only appears once in the most <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150617.pdf">recent set of minutes</a>, Fed watchers have stressed that the bank is likely to remain “data dependent” in setting the future course of policy. What that means is anyone’s guess. It sounds great to concentrate on the data. and clearly all analysts should have no problem with data-driven decision making.</p>
<p>But one has to wonder if a data-driven decision might be a means of distracting the market from a more insidious truth: Perhaps the data are truly in control. Maybe, despite the implied power of the Fed, the Federal Open Market Committee is no more able to raise the prevailing rate of interest than I am able to levitate.</p>
<p>We will see. One thing is for sure though: the quote of the FAS goes to Holly Huffman of JP Morgan, who relayed her hope that the Fed would hike rates at the upcoming meeting. Why?</p>
<p>“So we can start talking about something else.”</p>

<h2 id="are-financial-advisers-supposed-to-get-paid"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/07/20/are-financial-advisers-supposed-to-get-paid/">Are Financial Advisers Supposed to Get Paid?</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>For many investment professionals, the seemingly inexorable rise of robo-advisers constitutes an existential threat. The fear is simple and justified: Services now exist that provide investors with a portfolio that fits their expressed risk tolerance and reward inclinations for 0.25% of the assets invested in that portfolio.</p>
<p>That’s a great deal. Financial advisers offering a similar service at higher cost are in a tough place.</p>
<p>If we use the example of a financial adviser currently making $75,000 a year, one who splits their fee down the middle with their firm, we can see this pretty clearly. At a 1% fee, this adviser can make a comfortable middle-class income if they spend 60 hours a week talking to 100 or so happy clients with a grand total of $15 million invested with the firm.</p>
<p>If their fee were lowered to 0.25% of assets, the adviser would need to either take on more clients (and provide less service to existing ones) or seek wealthier clients. Either way, their firm would need $60 million in assets instead of $15 million to make the same amount of money. Like, duh, right?</p>
<p>If losing that much in fees worries you, a widely shared blog post should terrify you. <a href="https://medium.com/@blakeross/wealthfront-silicon-valley-tech-at-wall-street-prices-fdd2e5f54905" title="Link: https://medium.com/@blakeross/wealthfront-silicon-valley-tech-at-wall-street-prices-fdd2e5f54905">Blake Ross, who co-founded Firefox before spending six years at Facebook as director of product, maintains that those already-reduced fees are astronomically high and should be closer to zero</a>. He even accuses Wealthfront, one of the larger robo-advisers, of embodying the same “Wall Street” mentality that many find reprehensible.</p>
<p>So while investment professionals are staring at robo-advisers and wondering how they’ll ever compete on cost, technology folks are looking at robo-advisers and wondering if they can be undercut further. I’ve been saying this for a long time at this point, but <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/12/01/free-investing-is-the-new-free-checking-2/" title="Link: http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/12/01/free-investing-is-the-new-free-checking-2/">free investing is the new free checking</a>. The cost of these services is going to approach and eventually reach zero.</p>
<p><strong>So What Should You Do?</strong></p>
<p>Enterprising Investor is written for professional investors, so it’s tempting to interpret the question above from a business perspective. What should you do if you want to stay competitive?</p>
<p>The thing is that good business comes from good outcomes, so let’s ask the question from a different vantage point. What should you do if you want to give your clients a good outcome?</p>
<p>Blake’s argument is really simple to encapsulate. Many robo-advisers compare their fees to the typical investment adviser’s 1% and argue that they are fantastic. But that’s not necessarily the right benchmark to use. All fees reduce investment return, so what would happen if you didn’t pay any of them?</p>
<p>Well, if you’re able to save $5,000 a year for 50 years and invest it at a constant 6%, you’d be richer.</p>
<p>The more than $300,000 gap between a 1% annual fee and a .25% annual fee is striking, but so is the $125,000 gap between paying a seemingly nominal .25% and nothing. If you paid 1% a year in fees, you’d have an account that is smaller by 28.5%, whereas if you paid just .25%, you’d be behind by just over 8%.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Value after 50 Years of Saving $5,000 Annually</strong>
<img alt="Value after 50 Years of Saving 5000 Annually" src="images/Value-after-50-Years-of-Saving-5000-Annually1.png?resize=640%2C414" title="Image: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/07/Value-after-50-Years-of-Saving-5000-Annually1.png?resize=640%2C414"/></p>
<hr/>
<p>And remember, that’s for an account that receives regular contributions over time. For a lump sum investment, the gap is even larger.</p>
<p>So like, why would you pay fees? The answer you have to give is because the fees are for services that add value, right? So the only question that matters is simple . . .</p>
<p><strong>Value Compared to What?</strong></p>
<p>Blake’s post makes the point that many of the services that Wealthfront and other similar robo-advisers provide are of uncertain or questionable value, and he may well be right. It’s awfully difficult to beat a Vanguard target date retirement fund on cost.</p>
<p>But what is value here? What’s the point of saving money? Managing someone’s money well should be about maximizing their quality of life. It seems quite reductive to distill that down to the size of their bank account in retirement. Everybody <a href="https://youtu.be/EmZRLxnXamM?t=4s">wants more money</a>, but it’s not the point of existence. It’s just a means to buy the stuff you need or want.</p>
<p>A mean-variance optimized portfolio, however it’s delivered, is simply not the same as insight into what you will need and might want. It is also not as valuable. If you approach a client with a perfectly customized portfolio but fail to explain the role it will play in their life, they won’t care very much. They might well become a client, but they will miss the point of the exercise and you will have failed both them and yourself.</p>
<p>So don’t neglect the conversations that are really important when you sit down with your clients. Don’t forget to ask them about what they’re doing to live a good life. You should be able to have discussions about the trade-off between spending money now to <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/10/15/can-financial-advisers-make-their-clients-happy/">be happier</a> and saving it for later in a context that is broader than an ending account balance.</p>
<p>If you’re willing and able to have those sorts of conversations with clients, then it’ll be worth paying top dollar for your services. But that assertion only confirms that the product you provide — advice — is worth something. It doesn’t tackle the question of how to charge for it.</p>
<p>That’s somewhat intentional. How do you think we should be charging?</p>

<p>The investment community is coming to a powerful consensus: Investments have impact. When you match unused capital with an unfunded need, the magic of business happens. That business has a first-order effect: making money. It also has a second-order effect: profitability. The emerging consensus I refer to is that the second-order effect is worth assessing and even optimizing.</p>
<p>If that sounds like “impact investing” to you, you’re not totally off base. But that’s not what I’m talking about. Impact can be intentional or unintentional, but it can’t be avoided. Given that, doesn’t it make some sense, at minimum, to understand the follow-on effects of making an investment?</p>
<p>But if you are still a bit skeptical about the notion of incorporating social good into your portfolio, that’s understandable. For whatever reason, it is difficult for many people to think that a profit motive can be combined with something that improves the world. That’s unfortunate, but it comes from a good place. After all:</p>
<p><strong>Investing Is Not a Philanthropic Enterprise.</strong></p>
<p>It would be great if the trillions of dollars entrusted to financial intermediaries could be devoted directly and wholly to social good. But that’s not the way the world works. People entrust professionals to grow their assets so they can use them in the future. Making investment decisions without a focus on return makes that harder, and it harms our clients. That is infinitely worse than getting fired (which is also nearly certain to happen if you forget about your responsibility to seek a fair return).</p>
<p>So it’s a good thing you can actually find excellent returns by considering the impact of your investments. Tischhauser tossed a chart of his fund’s returns up on the screen, and it went from bottom left to top right just like it was supposed to. There are return streams here that can be accessed.</p>
<p>There may also be enduring edge. If one considers an almost stereotypical case of investing with impact, where one acts as a microfinance lender in a capital-starved market, it starts to become clear that if you get it right once, you might be able to get it right again. It also demonstrates that the local business environment might be quite uncorrelated with activity on Wall Street or anywhere else. Uncorrelated consistent returns are the holy grail of the investment industry. Wouldn’t it be great if you could earn them by helping people?</p>
<p>It would. That doesn’t tell you how to do it, but it does convey the promise. A great number of funds are showing interest in these strategies. But you don’t have to take my word for it. As Richard Brandweiner, CFA, who runs a $45-billion-plus superannuation fund (think pension fund if you’re not Australian), said at the beginning of the session, “Investing with purpose is not a fringe idea, but we need to learn to do it better.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, attendees did. </p>
<p>Here are a few quick things that you can do to catch up to those who made it to Frankfurt in the flesh:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Michael E. Porter and Mark R. Kramer’s “<a href="https://hbr.org/2011/01/the-big-idea-creating-shared-value">Creating Shared Value</a>.” It was widely referenced by speakers on this topic throughout the conference, and I’m personally very much looking forward to spending some quality time with it, especially if it’s at all as good as Porter’s “<a href="https://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy">What Is Strategy?</a>“ Debevoise suggested taking a look at the latter, as well as some other good next steps:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Next steps from <a href="https://twitter.com/nelldd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nelldd</a><br/><br/>Read: <a href="https://t.co/eO32NT645P">https://t.co/eO32NT645P</a><br/>Study: unilever, axa, etsy<br/>Study metrics: iris, sasb<br/>Craft your job<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FutureFinance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FutureFinance</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/593332971744186368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2015</a></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Learn goal programming. It looks a bit wonky, but I found listening to Read’s explanation of the discipline in the video above to be immensely clarifying. Goal programming is a system of balancing competing objectives that he suggests is a much better version of the asset allocation thinking that has been used in finance since the early 1960s. Time to upgrade your toolkit!</li>
<li>Shift your perspective. Tischhauser noted that he first did this by taking a bike ride from Geneva to South Africa. The poverty that he witnessed led him to brainstorm creative solutions and ultimately start his own fund. <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/andrew-sheng/">Andrew Sheng</a> noted in the earlier “<a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/events/long-termism-and-the-new-era-of-fiduciary-capitalism/">Long-Termism and the New Era of Fiduciary Capitalism</a>” panel that the sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia asks its employees to pursue a similar course. Travel somewhere without a capital market and think creatively. It can’t hurt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, we need to remember something critical in evaluating allocations to these countries: Poverty is a lack of choice. Investors raised in developed economies may not understand the firsthand experience of the very poor, but they can certainly grasp, at an atomic level, that entrepreneurship is about creating new choice.</p>
<p>Backing entrepreneurs is also a great way to make money.</p>

<h2 id="is-shadow-banking-scary"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/05/01/is-shadow-banking-scary/">Is Shadow Banking Scary?</a></h2>

<p>When I say “shadow banking,” do you think of money market and bond funds? I can’t blame you if that’s not where your mind goes first. After all, <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/shadow-banking">there</a> <a href="http://qz.com/327335/chinas-shadow-banking-is-back-with-a-vengeance-and-it-brings-bad-omens-with-it/">has</a> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-10/50-shades-of-shadow-banking-china-risks-reined-in">been</a> a <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/04/01-shadow-banking-china-primer-elliott-kroeber-yu">lot</a> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/30/china-economy-shadowbanking-idUSL4N0SP1O720141030">of</a> <a href="http://time.com/8671/why-you-need-to-worry-about-chinas-shadow-banking/">press</a> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml">about</a> shadow banking in China, and <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/03/10/shadow-banking-is-hurting-chinas-banks-and-thats-a-good-thing/" title="Link: http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/03/10/shadow-banking-is-hurting-chinas-banks-and-thats-a-good-thing/">we even published some of it</a>.</p>
<p>But even though shadow banking is huge in China, with its largest sector — wealth management products — clocking in at at 12 trillion yuan as of early 2014 and growing by 50% since 2013, it would take a lot of growth for it to be more than a drop in the global bucket.</p>
<p>Speaking at the 68th CFA Institute Annual Conference, Nico Valckx, a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), put the global size of the shadow banking sector at just about $75 trillion, which is just shy of the asset management industry’s mark. That’s not really surprising because there’s a lot of double counting there. Many asset management products are also shadow banking products.</p>
<p>If that comes as a shock, it’s because you may not have meditated yet on what shadow banking really means. Simply put, a shadow bank is an entity that engages in credit intermediation without as much regulation as a bank . . . or a formal liquidity backstop.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes Those Things Can Come in Handy</strong></p>
<p>As Valckx noted in his presentation,”Shadow Banking: Global Trends and Policy Developments,” the fears of many who lose sleep over shadow banks were in some ways realized during the financial crisis in the money market industry. After the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings led the Reserve Primary Fund to “break the buck” in 2008, investors panicked. (Full disclosure: my mother worked in fixed-income trading at Lehman Brothers from roughly 2000 to 2003.)</p>
<p>Money market fund share values were supposed to be solid at $1! A run on money markets and the asset-backed paper that they held ensued. And as our own <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/ccb.v2015.n2.1">research</a> on the subject notes, 43 individual money market funds wound up requiring sponsor support to keep their share price stable at $1.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that, if left unchecked, could become a significant problem. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) <a href="http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_141030.pdf?page_moved=1">estimated money market fund assets at $3.8 trillion globally</a>. And money market funds are supposed to be safe! Many practitioners use them as “cash-like” investments, expecting them to hold value during times of crisis. Just imagine the psychological impact of finding out that your “safe” investments . . . aren’t.</p>
<p>The difficulties that these funds experienced resulted from a simple issue: The market didn’t assess Lehman’s creditworthiness appropriately. People misallocated capital. Some people lost money. This sort of thing happens all the time, and most investors should understand that it is a possibility. But it goes from being a few people’s loss to a big deal when isolated losses cascade through an asset class. The reason that happened in this case was simple:</p>
<p><strong>There Was a Liquidity Mismatch</strong></p>
<p>The IMF <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/06/basics.htm">explains</a> that a money market instrument has two characteristics: a short maturity (under a year) and ready liquidity. The hope is that even if a security still has a couple of months to maturity, a ready market will exist for it so that it can be easily converted to cash.</p>
<p>But sometimes that doesn’t work, and the problem extends to more than just money market funds. When asked to name the two biggest risks in shadow banking, Valckx noted one you may have thought of — China. But he also identified one you probably hadn’t considered — a host of asset management strategies that have the potential for similar liquidity issues. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g6cu9i5yv9jgrcl/Screenshot%202015-04-27%2018.19.32.png?dl=0">This</a> chart (in which AE and EM stand for advanced economy and emerging market, respectively) shows a number of other strategies that are reasonably exposed to the same risks.</p>
<p>You’ll have to do your own work to find out how this affects your investments in particular, but Jim Grant, CFA, did a great job explaining how this can affect emerging market debt funds in an article about a year ago, which he <a href="http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3677436335001/sell-to-whom-michael-hasenstab/?#sp=show-clips">talked about</a> on <em>Fox Business News</em>. I found that example quite illustrative of a place where we might see stress when risk appetites inevitably wane.</p>
<p>If this has piqued your interest, the longer report that Valckx and his team <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfsr/2014/02/pdf/c2.pdf" title="Link: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfsr/2014/02/pdf/c2.pdf">put together</a> is almost certainly worth a read, as is our <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/ccb.v2015.n2.1">own</a>, which was authored by Rhodri Preece, CFA, who also served as moderator during the session. Preece has <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/marketintegrity/2015/04/27/shadow-banking-set-in-context-unlocking-capital-markets-or-migrating-risk/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/marketintegrity/2015/04/27/shadow-banking-set-in-context-unlocking-capital-markets-or-migrating-risk/">written</a> a quick primer on it, and the FSB’s <a href="http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_141030.pdf?page_moved=1" title="Link: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_141030.pdf?page_moved=1">monitoring report</a> is likely worth a look as well.</p>
<p>Returning to the question — is shadow banking scary? — I think you’ll answer it about the same way I did after reading these selections: it depends what kind of shadow bank you’re talking about.</p>
