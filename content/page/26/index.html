<h2 id="the-troll-economy-in-seven-charts"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/03/04/the-troll-economy-in-seven-charts/">The Troll Economy in Seven Charts</a></h2>
<p>_I wrote this essay for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor. It includes one of the few mixtapes on earth that qualifies for continuing education credits.
_</p>
<p>By troll economy, I mean that of the United States of America, of course.</p>
<p>Anybody who doesn’t think the United States is a special place has never tried <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-25-best-barbecue-restaurants-in-america-2015-7">real barbecue</a> (BBQ). But BBQ’s just the beginning. Let’s start with geopolitics. As the excellent book <em><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mr-peter-zeihan/the-accidental-superpower/9781478983118/">The Accidental Superpower</a></em> notes, most Americans have no grasp of the bounty they are blessed with. Author <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/speakers/peter-zeihan/">Peter Zeihan</a>, who will be speaking at the <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/">69th CFA Institute Annual Conference</a> in May, points out that the United States just happens to have the world’s best piece of arable land — the American Midwest — located conveniently amid the world’s largest navigable network of waterways.</p>
<p>If you forget every other nice thing you know about the United States but remember that, you still walk away thinking the country is disproportionately blessed by good fortune. Add to that some simple observations about US ports — the Chesapeake Bay alone “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fareed-zakaria-americas-prospects-are-promising-indeed/2014/11/20/eb91209a-70f3-11e4-ad12-3734c461eab6_story.html">boasts longer stretches of prime port property than the entire continental coast of Asia from Vladivostok to Lahore</a>” — and you can’t help but feel pretty positive about the country’s long-term competitiveness.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The U.S. has added jobs for 65 straight months, the longest streak on record.<a href="https://t.co/whRLn9enXB">https://t.co/whRLn9enXB</a> <a href="https://t.co/VsI8jRkDUc">pic.twitter.com/VsI8jRkDUc</a></p>— Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) <a href="https://twitter.com/bencasselman/status/705822105145905152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>And that competitiveness has come again to troll those who have forecast the imminent death of US economic expansion, fueled as it may be by monetary voodoo and financial engineering. New data released on Friday add just another piece of color to a picture that is far from bleak.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Unemployment-to-Population Ratio Fell Two-Tenths of a Percent on Strong Household Survey Hiring: <a href="https://t.co/GyKHrQ6yEJ">pic.twitter.com/GyKHrQ6yEJ</a></p>— Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) <a href="https://twitter.com/M_McDonough/status/705752568278999041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>It’s also an objective reality that the workers who have been on the sidelines are re-entering the labor force, at least to some degree.</p>
<p>And though wages haven’t grown yet, there’s ample reason to believe they should (and will).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"Great quarter guys"<a href="https://t.co/9EFdPkkdrL">https://t.co/9EFdPkkdrL</a> <a href="https://t.co/HNsitX3NEN">pic.twitter.com/HNsitX3NEN</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/703306637897928705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>But the economy is not the market, and this rosy picture hasn’t (yet) translated into what matters most for investors: growth. We can talk about the gap between expectations and performance — and there are some positive stories there — but the fact remains that revenues are not growing in aggregate.</p>
<p>Take a look at the last big piece I did — <a href="http://srvo.org/34-charts-this-time-is-different">34 Charts: This Time is Different</a> — to get some more color there.</p>
<p>But let’s all close our eyes for a minute and think about what it might mean to live in a world where Americans who want jobs have them and their wages start growing.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If it quacks like a duck.... <a href="https://t.co/tnCTkJXjBN">pic.twitter.com/tnCTkJXjBN</a></p>— Sloane Ortel (@sloaneortel) <a href="https://twitter.com/sloaneortel/status/705850238611931144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>And the word gets out about this thing called inflation. At just such a time, it would be convenient to remember a thing called <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PhillipsCurve.html">the Phillips Curve</a>, which suggests that wage inflation will accelerate as unemployment continues to fall.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Markets still barely pricing in one more <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fed</a> rate hike this year. <a href="https://t.co/CL8e84fugU">pic.twitter.com/CL8e84fugU</a></p>— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href="https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/705704070019940356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>In just such a circumstance, it’s likely that current projections about the path of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve will be seen as impossibly dovish, unless of course the Fed chooses to ignore its long-time targets: 5% unemployment and 2% inflation.</p>
<p>Why might it do that? Perhaps it <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/03/why-the-federal-reserve-should-be-the-worlds-central-bank">will focus on the still-tepid global economy</a>. Vice chair Stanley Fischer <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20150526a.htm">insists the Fed must look beyond its borders but also remember that it is not the world’s central bank</a>.</p>
<p>In either circumstance, America could frustrate the rest of the globe. A Fed that’s forced towards hawkishness as domestic job gains and inflation continue to materialize would be a headwind to the rest of the world unless it follows suit.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Germany?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Germany</a> beats the U.S. on real <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GDP</a> per Capita. <a href="https://t.co/cf1tRsQKVh">pic.twitter.com/cf1tRsQKVh</a></p>— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href="https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/705845362716762112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>That might happen! But we’re still a long way from any sort of conclusive directional proof. It’s also hard to imagine a Fed that ignores rapidly increasing inflation and a tightening labor market in deference to global growth risks for very long. Especially if you take a moment to consider the current domestic political climate.</p>
<p>In any case, <a href="http://fat-pitch.blogspot.com/2016/03/march-macro-update-recession-risk.html?spref=tw">an imminent recession does not seem to be in the cards for the United States</a>. No reason not to stay vigilant — these things revert quickly — but the immediate risks are elsewhere. What if the troll economy forces rates upward unexpectedly and well before the rest of the world is ready? That’s the risk I’d ponder as you head off for the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="34-charts-this-time-is-different"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/02/27/34-charts-this-time-is-different/">34 Charts: This Time is Different</a></h2>
<p><em>This was one of the more widely read pieces I ever wrote for the Enterprising Investor at CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>“This time is different” — I might include that in the title of everything I publish from now on.</p>
<p>I’ll never be wrong, which is an appealing proposition. A man can dream. And funny thing: A dream is the subject at hand.</p>
<p>In October, I asked whether the market could <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/10/26/15-charts-can-the-market-have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too/">have its cake and eat it too</a>. The hope was for persistent low interest rates and consistently appreciating securities.</p>
<p>Somebody seems to have remembered cake doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p>According to some, this buying opportunity is brought to you by the letter “C”: China, commodities, and the now questionably healthy consumer. Reaching towards risk feels sensible. It’s been nearly 10 years since it wasn’t.</p>
<p>But today, growth, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/14/weekend-reads-the-recurring-death-of-certainty/">like certainty</a>, is hard to come by. We hear the word “recession” again. There have been more <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=sell%20stocks&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5" title="Link: https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=sell%20stocks&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5">Google searches for the phrase “sell stocks”</a> this month than at any time since October 2008. And January is not over.</p>
<p>To some strategists, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rbs-the-chance-of-an-imminent-recession-is-75-2016-1">the writing</a> is on <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/albert-edwards-societe-generales-woodstock-for-bears-financial-crisis-prediction-2016-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T">the wall</a>. I wrote recently that anyone who says they know exactly what will happen is wrong, cheating, or both. I still think that. So before getting into what I see, I want to tell you what to do: your homework. Now is the time to <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/21/todays-market-is-when-you-distinguish-yourself-as-an-investor/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/21/todays-market-is-when-you-distinguish-yourself-as-an-investor/">distinguish yourself as an investor</a>. So as you read through everything below, remember: I’ll be disappointed if you wind up agreeing with everything I say.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"It was the fifteenth-straight year-over-year fall in revenues for IBM" <a href="https://t.co/uNkm0yBUPU">https://t.co/uNkm0yBUPU</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/adamsamson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adamsamson</a> <a href="https://t.co/0XTqAHkmSt">pic.twitter.com/0XTqAHkmSt</a></p>— Mamta Badkar (@mamtabadkar) <a href="https://twitter.com/mamtabadkar/status/689563756473483264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Fifteen straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines from a company that once set the world on fire. Things haven’t actually been that bad for IBM since they <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/tripping-through-ibms-astonishingly-insane-1937-corporate-songbook/">disbanded their corporate orchestra in 2001</a>.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=Linear&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1453323600000&amp;chddm=499698&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;cmpto=INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC&amp;cmptdms=0&amp;q=NYSE:IBM&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=0d2fVtCOKpL5eqfOj6AG">outperformed the NASDAQ</a> until revenue growth reversed and it transmogrified from a tech company into an object lesson.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that to be mean. Without question, IBM is still changing the world. <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/">They make incredible things</a>. But they are far from the company they used to be. In 2000, books published in the English language mentioned IBM roughly <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=IBM%2CIntel%2C+Cisco%2Cmicrosoft&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2CIBM%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CIntel%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CCisco%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmicrosoft%3B%2Cc0">twice as often as Intel, Cisco, and Microsoft combined</a>. Today, “IBM” is googled <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ibm%2C%20cisco%2C%20intel%2C%20microsoft&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5">less than any of them</a>.</p>
<p>Is it prudent to bank on a rebound? Think it over as you keep reading.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Equal Weighted <a href="https://t.co/saumOX5pJH">https://t.co/saumOX5pJH</a> <a href="https://t.co/iq7n7Kd1Am">pic.twitter.com/iq7n7Kd1Am</a></p>— zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/688053290580492289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Because IBM is not alone. Investors focused on the Shanghai Composite could be forgiven for the assumption that the bull market we’ve experienced has brought us to broad-based new highs. Consider the experience of a wide range of companies instead, and it’s transparently not so simple.</p>

<p>Though not cause for alarm on its own, the mood of most consumers is far from buoyant.

<p>A good rule for when investment people invoke politics is to stop listening. So I won’t blame you for rolling your eyes. I only bring it up to highlight something that I don’t think is so well understood in the global investment community: American optimism is being tested. What’s especially sad is that negative readings on this particular measure used to be quickly reverting statistical aberrations. Not any more.</p>

<p>But there is the little matter of what happens next. Let’s consider the case of China, currently the world’s largest exporter of volatility.

<p>And things might still soften from here. The linked article makes two critical points: First, these are export orders, not exports. That means that this series will materialize in actual trade flows in two to three months' time.</p>
<p>Second, a lot of exports from Taiwan are sent to Chinese factories owned by Taiwanese companies to then be exported again. That means the share of GDP coming from investment in China might rise simply because exports fall. This is not a positive development.</p>

<p>But this is. Kind of. Shenzhen is the city directly adjacent to Hong Kong on the Chinese mainland, and it’s also the home of a booming technology sector.

In November, the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4ea8e320-9420-11e5-b190-291e94b77c8f.html">reported</a> that residents in Shenzhen could look forward to strong wage growth, in contrast to stagnating pay packets across the border in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The existence of growth is a good thing, but the intensity of change in the value of a square foot should make you wonder how scarce  growth really is. And what happens if that growth dissipates?</p>
<p>And zoom out for a second. If you assume <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers are right that 2016 GDP growth in China will come in below 6%, strip out the nearly 50% of growth that comes from investment and then consider how rapidly prices are changing in the economic zones where there is organic growth.

<p>If I could hear the thoughts of every other investor who works in Midtown Manhattan, I imagine they’d be saying something along the lines of “the Fed is distorting asset prices.”</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve is not useless. I was around in 2008, working in the auction-rate preferred market. It was dominated by Lehman Brothers. I know what it’s like when liquidity disappears. I’m sharply skeptical of any argument that the world would have been better off without a liquidity provider of last resort at the peak of the crisis.</p>
<p>But this time is different. The problem now is not liquidity. It’s that growth is accruing to a collection of businesses that can serve the entire world with a a tiny village of employees.

<p>For instance, what happens to the auto business when self-driving cars are widely adopted? How big will the auto parts industry be? Will it have millions of customers or a handful? How many autos will have to be manufactured as car utilization rates climb from <a href="http://ark-invest.com/webx0/how-many-cars-can-one-zipcar-replace">around 4%</a> to something closer to 100%? Since (for now) it owns the button you press to summon the car, Uber will be having a nice time. AutoZone? Not so sure. The companies that sell through them? That’s even less certain.</p>
<p>I am not predicting the end of history. Monopolies end. Progress is not immediate. Remember IBM? Ever glanced at what <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/07/22/130585002/2010-isnt-what-many-futurists-of-the-past-imagined">people thought 2010 would look like</a>?</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t poke around in the public equity markets for what will replace today’s monopolies. And it’s doubtful there are 500 companies that are worth 1.6 times sales as the economy flirts with recession and pricing power evaporates. And deflation is a thing. And the rapid growth of valuations relative to realized growth contains risk. And what’s happening in emerging markets is about more than just oil. And the returns society as a whole received from an unprecedented expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet were not that great towards the latter part of the intervention. And now we’ve got at least one Japan hanging around that needs to be unwound.</p>
<p>And against that backdrop, every risk on earth is being repriced. We can still be friends if you don’t agree with me though.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I saved this Tweet to cheer you up <a href="https://t.co/IyHIuTmtGU">pic.twitter.com/IyHIuTmtGU</a></p>— StockCats (@StockCats) <a href="https://twitter.com/StockCats/status/688515811921760256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Because I believe this too. But I’m 27 years old now, so I have a pretty good idea of how long 20–25 years is. And the pace of innovation has quickened immensely since the first top on this chart in 1929 and, indeed, since the most recent one in 2000. It’s not going to slow.</p>
<p>So really I believe a version of this: That by the time I’m 50, I’ll have lived through an era of now-unfathomable, unprecedented prosperity. But just as this recent bout of volatility was in some ways brought to us by the letter “C,” we’ll have to wait and see what gets us there. And patiently, because it’s a long road.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-smarter"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/02/26/how-to-get-smarter/">How to Get Smarter</a></h2>
<p>It’s simple: Lever yourself with technology.</p>
<p>It’s not controversial to suggest that computers (<a href="http://genius.com/Marc-andreessen-why-software-is-eating-the-world-annotated">and the software that they run</a>) have changed a lot about the way that we live. Mainstream science documentaries are <a href="http://www.discoverychannelasia.com/shows/futurescape-with-james-woods/">already discussing the eventual emergence of a human-machine meld</a> as an inevitability. Whether that presently far-fetched idea comes to pass or not, there can be no disputing that <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/07/is-artificial-intelligence-for-real/">AI is for real</a>.</p>
<p>Any observer is bound to wonder: Will I be left behind? <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf">A widely cited estimate suggests that 47% of total US employment is at risk of being replaced by technology</a>. Think like a portfolio manager: Isn’t that the sort of risk you should hedge?</p>
<p>You can, but hedging well is a function of effort not security selection. I’m putting my money where my mouth is here: The organizing premise that CFA Institute rests on is that you can always be a better analyst. So, I’m a bit biased towards continuous improvement. If you want to take this with a grain of salt, fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>Your Loss</strong></p>
<p>We polled <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers about their comfort with technology, and the plurality (62%) of the 583 participants responded, “Comfortable — I’m a skilled user, but there’s a lot I don’t know.”</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What is your comfort level with technology?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/What-Is-Your-Comfort-Level-with-Technology.png"><img alt="What is your comfort level with technology" src="images/What-Is-Your-Comfort-Level-with-Technology.png?resize=640%2C273" title="Image: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/What-Is-Your-Comfort-Level-with-Technology.png?resize=640%2C273"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>So, what steps can one take to turn “a lot” into “a little”? The first step might be as simple as learning a few keyboard shortcuts. If, like many, you’re a daily user of Microsoft Excel, there’s no excuse not to invest a little bit of time getting faster.</p>
<p>I spent a number of years as a ski racer and coach, and I can tell you with authority that the difference between an advanced and intermediate skier is whether they are able to <a href="http://youcanski.com/gallery/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/greg-shorts-1flat-1-of-1.jpg" title="Link: http://youcanski.com/gallery/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/greg-shorts-1flat-1-of-1.jpg">lean out over the fall line</a> while turning. Using Excel without a mouse is exactly the same sort of bright-line separator. Especially if you would have answered “of course” to this poll, aspiring towards mouse-free spreadsheeting is an excellent interim goal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are resources to help you. An excellent software package called <a href="http://www.veodin.com/keyrocket/">KeyRocket</a> integrates nicely into Microsoft Office on Windows computers and shows you a little notification every time you perform an operation that could have been done more quickly with a hotkey. It also has a Chrome extension. I’m not aware of a similar program for Macs, but <a href="http://www.hotkey-eve.com/">HotkeyEVE</a> gives a similar introduction to the many shortcuts that can speed your navigation through the (highly hotkey-friendly) Mac operating system. And <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-one-key-that-infuriates-bankers-so-much-theyll-pop-it-out-of-their-keyboards-2012-5">here’s a quick explanation</a> if you’re mystified by the notion that anyone would rip F1 off of their keyboard.</p>
<p>Just as leaning out over the fall line is an introduction to a world of fast turns, deep powder, and a better life in general, adding hotkeys into your routine will leave you wondering how you ever got anything done without them. You’ll also quickly realize that they’re something of a minimum. As you start performing the same operations as before more quickly, you’ll start to wonder: What about new ones?</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye, Deus Ex Appina</strong></p>
<p>It used to be the case that if you wanted your computer to do something that it couldn’t do already, you had to wait around for someone else to build an app for you.</p>
<p>That is no longer a thing.</p>
<p>The cost and difficulty of creating your own simple apps has plummeted in recent years. And we’ll get to that. But a host of new technologies bring a great deal of the power that can be harnessed by writing simple applications into the hands of the average user, no code required. Perhaps the most widely known of these is a service called If This, Then That. It’s <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for short.</p>
<p>Its integrations run the gamut from <a href="https://ifttt.com/connect/hue/ios_location" title="Link: https://ifttt.com/connect/hue/ios_location">turning the lights on when you get home</a> to triggering alerts based on <a href="https://ifttt.com/stocks">movements in the financial markets</a> and even <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/379341-mulled-wine-for-christmas">ordering mulled wine on Christmas</a>. Presumably, you could set up an automatic light switch rave whenever one of the companies in your portfolio beats earnings or rallies sharply.</p>
<p>But that’s actually pretty picayune compared to the tools you can use to get some actual analysis done. You’re doubtless aware that data from services like Bloomberg and Reuters can be pulled easily into Excel. The <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred-addin/install_windows.html">St. Louis Fed even has its own tool</a> to pipe in the data from its excellent <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">FRED service</a> alongside the other data streams.</p>
<p><strong>But You Can Go Further</strong></p>
<p>A new service called <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/" title="Link: https://www.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a> allows you to pull in data from a substantial and growing number of web services. So, you can <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/bs/news-and-content-search-diffbot" title="Link: https://open.blockspring.com/bs/news-and-content-search-diffbot">build custom news searches</a>, overlay a <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/bs/sentiment-analysis-with-aylien">sentiment analysis</a>, and <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/pkpp1233/send-twilio-message" title="Link: https://open.blockspring.com/pkpp1233/send-twilio-message">have your spreadsheet text you</a> if people are saying nice things about you on the internet. A state of hyper-awareness is only a few alerts away.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that you can also pipe in data from <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/tags/306">Quandl</a>, <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/tags/361">Data.gov</a>, and <a href="https://open.blockspring.com/tags/15" title="Link: https://open.blockspring.com/tags/15">pretty much any website</a>. But, by the time you get around to doing stuff like that, it’s probably time to start thinking about writing actual code.</p>
<p>Which programming language should you learn? <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/choose-programming-language" title="Link: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/choose-programming-language">It’s a daunting question</a>, but it doesn’t need to be. For one thing, learning to program is a lot like learning a foreign language. At first, you will be expressing yourself with roughly the eloquence of a five-year-old. And you’ll be able to do about as much. But eventually, you’ll be able to access a whole set of conversations that made no sense beforehand. And even if you find out later that you’d prefer to have a different set of conversations, you’ll still have learned something.</p>
<p>That’s how you get smarter.</p>

<h2 id="humanity-will-leave-coal-behind-but-when"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/02/04/humanity-will-leave-coal-behind-but-when/">Humanity Will Leave Coal Behind, But When?</a></h2>
<p>Coal has done a lot for humanity. It literally took us out of the cold.</p>
<p>It powered the first industrial revolution, which fueled countless advances that have made the world altogether more livable. And today hundreds of thousands of people make a difficult living pulling it out of the ground, and millions more precede them.</p>
<p>Of course, that is rapidly changing. In West Virginia, once the heart of coal country, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-only-state-where-less-than-half-its-citizens-work-2015-01-13" title="Link: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-only-state-where-less-than-half-its-citizens-work-2015-01-13">less than half of all civilian adults are employed</a>. The decline of the coal industry is not just an American phenomenon. Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces in northeastern China, once the country’s industrial heartland largely because of their abundant coal resources, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/china/21637449-after-promising-signs-renaissance-chinas-old-rustbelt-suffers-big-setback-back-cold" title="Link: http://www.economist.com/news/china/21637449-after-promising-signs-renaissance-chinas-old-rustbelt-suffers-big-setback-back-cold">have long since fallen behind</a> and are now among China’s slowest growing.</p>
<p>It’s not that hard to figure out why. Over the past five years, the <a href="https://www.quandl.com/data/ODA/PCOALAU_USD-Coal-Price?utm_medium=graph&amp;utm_source=quandl" title="Link: https://www.quandl.com/data/ODA/PCOALAU_USD-Coal-Price?utm_medium=graph&amp;utm_source=quandl">price of coal has decreased sharply</a>. The Dow Jones US Coal Index <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=4931635" title="Link: https://www.google.com/finance?cid=4931635">trades at its lowest levels ever</a>. The industry is in a tough spot.</p>
<p>And that’s before you even consider carbon emissions. Bloomberg ran an excellent story entitled “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2014-hottest-year-on-record/">2014 Was the Hottest Year on Record</a>.” A year later, they followed that up with a similarly titled piece, “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/hottest-year-on-record/" title="Link: http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/hottest-year-on-record/">2015 Was the Hottest Year on Record</a>.”</p>
<p>I hope you can see where I’m going with this. It is not controversial to say that the earth is warming. The only question is: What happens next? There are <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/17/climate-change-and-financial-stability-which-risk-is-most-critical/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/17/climate-change-and-financial-stability-which-risk-is-most-critical/">physical, transition, and liability risks to get familiar with</a>, and investors should not waste time.</p>
<p>In his excellent curation of the best resources to help investors with this, my colleague Usman Hayat, CFA, observed that despite all the headlines climate change generates, “<a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/16/climate-change-and-investment-decisions-selected-reading/">curiously there is little if any coverage of the phenomenon in traditional investment textbooks</a>.” Time to bone up.</p>
<p>There’s no question that there is an intersection. Arch Coal, long one of the largest coal producers, just <a href="http://www.archcoal.com/restructuring/">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>A driving reason for that: There is a strong case that we won’t be burning coal forever. It’s cheap, but dirty. It provided 41% of the <a href="http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/coal/">world’s electricity in 2013</a>, but to understate the case, new <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/anti-coal-protesters-target-climate-change-sceptic-peer-matt-ridley">coal projects are unpopular</a>. In the United States, coal-burning power plants <a href="http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/electricity.html">account for about 39% of the electricity generated but 77% of the sector’s carbon dioxide emissions</a>.</p>
<p>What compounds the problem for the coal industry is that continuing to use coal is a choice the world makes. And given the environmental costs associated with that choice, the world might be inclined to change its mind. So we decided to ask <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> readers how many years they thought it would take for coal to be phased out as an energy source. There wasn’t much of a consensus among our 730 respondents.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How many years until coal is phased out as an energy source?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/Coal-poll.png" title="Link: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/Coal-poll.png"><img alt="Coal-poll" src="images/Coal-poll.png?resize=640%2C285" title="Image: https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/02/Coal-poll.png?resize=640%2C285"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>At least 42% of our readers project they will be dead before it happens. I got that number on the back of an envelope, but I think it’s not far from the truth. The average global life expectancy was <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends/en/">71 years</a> in 2013, so if one were to assume our readers are all 20 years old, “It’ll take more than 50 years” and “I’ll be dead before it happens” are basically the same statement.</p>
<p>And they might be right. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/asia/china-coal-power-energy-policy.html?_r=0">Coal power plants keep being built</a>. It takes a lot of assuming to think that coal will go away soon.</p>
<p>Or perhaps not. As my colleague Svi Rosov, PhD, CFA, <a href="https://twitter.com/SRosov/status/695337706042236928" title="Link: https://twitter.com/SRosov/status/695337706042236928">noted on Twitter</a>, that sure looks like an <a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/s-curve-business-23032.html">S curve</a> in adoption. These are widely thought to indicate a mature if saturated market. Technological disruption is always possible.</p>
<p>And it’s tough to handicap, but there is a compelling argument that that’s happening. The <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/us-has-more-solar-workers-than-coal-miners-2014-7" title="Link: http://www.businessinsider.com/us-has-more-solar-workers-than-coal-miners-2014-7">ranks of solar workers in the United States now outnumber coal miners</a>. There has been discussion of a <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/inside-the-dynomak-a-fusion-technology-cheaper-than-coal" title="Link: http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/inside-the-dynomak-a-fusion-technology-cheaper-than-coal">cheaper-than-coal fusion reactor</a>. That may sound like the stuff of science fiction now, but many realities of daily life today would have seemed just as farfetched 20 years.</p>
<p>And if the rumor that the White House wants to impose <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/695340409459859456">a $10-a-barrel fee on oil</a> to fund green transportation proposals has any validity, the act of politics I mentioned in my earlier tweet is at least somewhat more likely.</p>

<h2 id="the-recurring-death-of-certainty"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/01/14/the-recurring-death-of-certainty/">The Recurring Death of Certainty</a></h2>
<p>When are we going to learn?</p>
<p>The most persistent theme I’ve ever noticed has been that anyone who professes to know exactly what’s going to happen is wrong, cheating, or both. Markets, it’s been proven, just don’t work that way. Neither does life.</p>
<p>Even forecasts as simple as “the sun will come up tomorrow” can be complicated by clouds.</p>
<p>I don’t generally write these Weekend Reads columns, so when I fill in for colleagues, I like to take the opportunity to share provocative ideas that I believe will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Last time I shared some of my favorite works on subjects <a href="http://srvo.org/zombies-strategy-and-the-future-of-the-planet">ranging from effective strategic thinking to the tax treatment of zombies</a>.</p>
<p>This time, I’m writing as the prices of risk assets plummet and investors’ collective attention seems to be focused anywhere but on the long term. So I’m going to try to help you contextualize the here and now in the hopes that you’ll be able to see beyond it to opportunity.</p>
<p>With his characteristic brilliance, CNBC’s Jim Cramer summed up the prevailing risk appetites in a tweet, asking if a lottery ticket was more investable than Freeport-McMoran or Chesapeake Energy. When a lotto ticket compares favorably to the equity of the <a href="http://www.fcx.com/company/industry_context.htm">137th ranked member of the Fortune 500</a> and the <a href="http://www.chk.com/about">second-largest natural gas producer in the United States</a>, it’s time to re-examine your beliefs. Whatever they are.</p>
<p>For those of you who are fortunate enough to be members of CFA Institute, I’m pleased to report <a href="https://cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/books/Pages/investment_idea_generation_guide.aspx?WPID=BrowseProducts">we’ve just released a tool to help you examine and develop those beliefs</a>.</p>
<p>Our <em>Investment Idea Generation Guide</em> is a compendium of tools to help you figure out what you really think, strategies to harmonize those thoughts into a worldview, and approaches you can use to translate that worldview into measurable alpha. <a href="http://www.jasonapollovoss.com/web/">Jason Voss</a> and I had a tremendous amount of fun working on it, and I honestly think that sitting down with it is one of the more productive things that you can do. And now seems to be the perfect time.</p>
<p>If you’re not a CFA Institute member yet, no big deal. We’d love for you to <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/community/membership/Pages/index.aspx">join</a> or, barring that, pick up a copy on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Investment-Idea-Generation-Guide-Jason-ebook/dp/B01946EMNQ">Amazon</a>. Or just keep reading. Because for the balance of this post, I’m going to try and round up a few things that are objectively true at the moment and highly relevant.</p>
<p><strong>1. Spreads are widening, and people are noticing.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, <em>Enterprising Investor</em> colleague <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/author/martinfridson/">Martin Fridson, CFA</a>. In an <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-12/junk-bonds-signal-44-chance-of-recession-in-2016-fridson-says">interview with Bloomberg</a>, he points out that the 7.39% spread investors in high-yield bonds were demanding over Treasuries during the month ending 8 January points to a 44% chance of recession. Stripping out the uniformly shellacked commodities sector, he still finds a market-derived probability of 20%. Though he goes on to note that he is inclined towards optimism, those new to these developments would do well to read the 2 December 2015 note from colleague <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/12/02/the-credit-markets-are-softening-and-funding-is-tightening/">David Schawel, CFA</a>. Those not so new to the story will likely already know that <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BAMLH0A2HYB">the daily spread has widened since Marty highlighted the issue</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. If you’re looking for inflation expectations, you can find them in the toilet.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/T5YIFR">5-year, 5-year forward inflation expectation rate is at the lowest level ever, apart from the 2008–2009 recession</a>. But what does that really mean? Though this spread is widely used as an indicator of inflation, it’s really just the output of a formula. The implications of that are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kocherlakota-breakevens-tweet-2016-1">well detailed here.</a> In fact, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/11/11/three-reasons-why-it-is-still-a-good-time-to-talk-about-inflation/">it might be a fantastic time to buy protection against rising inflation</a>. But it’s worth remembering that even if this series doesn’t axiomatically mean inflation expectations are falling, its sustained decline certainly doesn’t mean that expectations are rising.</p>
<p><strong>3. Real growth expectations are right next to them.</strong></p>
<p>The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model is suggesting that <a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx?panel=1">GDP growth will come in at an annualized rate of .8%</a> for the fourth quarter of 2015. <a href="http://projects.wsj.com/econforecast/#ind=gdp&amp;r=20">Forecasters surveyed by the</a> <em><a href="http://projects.wsj.com/econforecast/#ind=gdp&amp;r=20">Wall Street Journal</a></em> have divergent expectations, but they are almost uniformly higher. <a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/fipfedawp/2014-07.htm">A paper analyzing the accuracy of GDPNow</a> found that it had particular trouble forecasting private inventories and exports. Though likely incorporated into the current reading already, a <a href="http://finviz.com/futures_charts.ashx?t=DX&amp;p=d1">sharply higher dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015</a> and <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CBI">flattening private inventories through the third quarter of 2015</a> don’t seem to indicate that the model is erring on the high end.</p>
<p><strong>4. Not many US stocks have hit new 52-week highs.</strong></p>
<p>Duh, right? After all, stock indices themselves are well below their peaks, so you wouldn’t expect a large number of the equities that compose them to be trading near record levels. But here’s the thing: The number of stocks making new highs was falling even as headline indices were rising. You can see what I’m getting at by taking a look at the <a href="http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=%24NYHILO&amp;p=W&amp;b=5&amp;g=0&amp;id=p86135214068">NYSE High-Low Index</a>, which — you guessed it — tracks that relationship. Check out <a href="http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:high-low_index">this tutorial</a> for a quick primer on how to peer inside of this interplay and how to use the tool to make decisions. You should be able to tell right away that the market’s breadth sure isn’t minty.</p>
<p><strong>5. Nobody seems to want oil.</strong></p>
<p>I spoke with a very sharp friend in the oil business on Tuesday night who shared a cutting observation: “At $40 oil, people were confident. At $30, oil they’re terrified.” The evidence would appear to support a sense of doom. Here are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gundlach-oil-charts-2016-1">five charts that purport to “definitively prove oil is toast.”</a> That analysis was conducted before the Tuesday inventory report, which noted that “<a href="http://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf">inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years</a>.” It’s unclear what will come of this. All I can say is that if you’re considering taking down some of that inventory for your personal account, I’d advise against accepting physical delivery. One of the few moments of levity in the last six months of oil news came when Bloomberg’s Tracy Alloway <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-03/that-time-i-tried-to-buy-some-crude-oil">did just that</a> and reported on the absurdity of the process.</p>
<p>With those five points in mind, it’s time to focus longer term. Here’s some reading that will help you find opportunity.</p>
