<h2 id="what-makes-a-great-trader"><a class="toclink" href="../../2014/04/16/what-makes-a-great-trader/">What Makes a Great Trader?</a></h2>
<p><em>This is one of my favorite interviews ever. It was first published on CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>If you peruse the Wikipedia entries that describe some of the world’s great investors, you’ll often find that they share a common footnote: a series of books entitled “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Wizards">The Market Wizards</a>” which feature <a href="http://jackschwager.com/">Jack Schwager’s</a> profiles of a number of successful traders.</p>
<p>His most recent book, <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118858697.html">The Little Book of Market Wizards</a> is a distillation of those interviews into a collection of lessons that can provide a useful entry point for those who might not be familiar with the habits, thought patterns, and disciplines that can differentiate great traders from good ones.</p>
<p>Jack and I spoke recently about his most recent book, the characteristics of great traders, and the path that those who should aspire to be great should follow. A condensed and edited transcript follows, beneath the full conversation.</p>
<p><strong>CFA Institute: What does the word “trader” mean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack Schwager:</strong> To me, trader means, first of all, someone who is as likely to go short, as well as long. It takes away this automatic long bias. That’s one critical element to the word, “trader.”</p>
<p>Another element of it is, I think, a willingness to change position with maybe more frequency than someone you might term as a “long term investor.” Those are the key elements.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s odd, when I remember for “Market Wizards,” the first of the Market Wizard books, when I interviewed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rogers">Jim Rogers</a>, immediately as soon as I stepped into his Brownstone he said, “I don’t know why you want to interview me, I’m not a trader.”</p>
<p>That was his opening line. I said, “Well, yeah. I know you invest long term but, in my mind, you are a trader because you will go short as well as long, and change positions, and so forth.”</p>
<p>In my mind you are making decisions. To me, decision on when to go in, out, reverse positions, that’s a trader. As opposed to a long term investor who says, “I want to have 50 percent of my money in equities. I’m going to buy an index. I’m going to stay for 40 years.”</p>
<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that but that’s not a trader.</p>
<p><strong>How do great traders go about finding their approach to the markets? What would you say sets them apart?</strong></p>
<p>Novices tend to believe there’s some answer out there, that it’s a matter of finding the right formula, the single right technique. That’s why books like, “How I made a million dollars trading in the markets,” always sell well.</p>
<p>The truth is it doesn’t work that way. There is no single way that works continuously. If it did, it would stop working anyway because everyone would follow it.</p>
<p>It’s a really a matter of finding a method that is right for the person. It varies all over the place because there are people like, going back to Rogers, people like Rogers who have complete disdain for technical analysis. He’d say that the only people he’s met that make money in technical analysis is those that sell their technical analysis services, that’s his take on it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ve got people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_S._Schwartz">Martin Schwartz</a> who’ve done phenomenally well. He’d say: “I spent a decade as a fundamental analyst, but I got rich as a technician.”</p>
<p>Believe me, Rogers could never make money using technical analysis and Schwartz could not make money using fundamental analysis. Yet, they both do terrifically well.</p>
<p>The very first thing to get across to people is you’ve got to figure out what is the right method. It’s not just fundamental versus technical. Either are you short-term, or you’re long-term. Do you want to trade stocks? Do you want to trade futures? Do you want to trade currencies? On and on with the variations.</p>
<p>It’s a discovery process, an evolutionary process. Nobody can tell you that.</p>
<p>I get emails from people sometimes. They’ll say, “What trading method would you recommend?” To me, the question is a lot like “I’m going to buy an expensive suit. What size should I get?”</p>
<p>How would I know? I don’t know if you’re six-six or five-five, so you can’t answer that question. There is no answer to that question. There is no right sized suit for everybody, and people need to think of trading the same way. There is no right size trading method for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Is it enough to “find the right suit size” so to speak?</strong></p>
<p>The approach has to have an edge. It’s not enough to just have an approach that you’re comfortable with. It can make all the sense in the world. On paper, it might sound reasonable, but the markets don’t pay off for approaches that sound reasonable. They pay off for what works, and what works may often be very counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>You have to get some sense of feeling and confidence that that approach that you’ve evolved works. By work, I don’t mean it’s a money machine. I just mean that over time it’s making more than it’s losing. That’s the edge.</p>
<p><strong>What about managing risk?</strong></p>
<p>That’s very important, but first I’ll note that these are not in order of importance, they’re in chronological order. You develop a method that’s right for your personality. It has to have an edge. Then, when you’re implementing it, part of the planning process has to be risk management.</p>
<p>You can have a method that has an edge, but if you don’t take risk management into account very seriously, and your approach leaves you open to having single trades, or a small number of trades, lose a lot of money.</p>
<p>A good approach could be sabotaged by a few mistakes. You never want that. You never want to be at the mercy of having a few mistakes knock you out of the game. Virtually every trader I ever interviewed said the risk management part is more important than the method.</p>
<p>You’ve got the key ingredients, but it all doesn’t mean anything unless you implement it, and implement it consistently. Another way of saying that is “discipline.” You need the discipline to take your method, with the edge and the risk management, and stay true to it. There are trades that are going to look scary and that you’re going to really not want to take, but if it’s part of your methodology, you take them.</p>
<p>There are times your methodology, or your risk management, tells you, “Here’s where you’re out.” You may hate to get out, but that’s your methodology, that’s your risk management, you get out. You have to be strict on the discipline part.</p>
<p><strong>So self-knowledge, having an edge, risk management, and discipline are the qualities that set these traders apart?</strong></p>
<p>Flexibility is another trait that separates great traders from just about everybody else. They’re able to change on a dime. They could be wildly bullish one minute, and if something happens to change their mind, they’re able to be wildly bearish the next. That flexibility to be able to change your mind and not hope that your position is right is an essential ingredient.</p>
<p>That’s true of a number of traders. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tudor_Jones">Paul Tudor Jones</a> was bullish on the stock market when I saw him one week. Two weeks later, he was bearish.</p>
<p><strong>Apart from the characteristics we’ve discussed, is there some other quality that all of these great traders have . . . Is there a look or something? Did all the successful traders go to Harvard Business School, for example?</strong></p>
<p>No, of course not, some of them went to Princeton.</p>
<p>No, it’s become more a characteristic of the modern hedge fund world. and loses its way people getting jobs within hedge funds. The people from the Ivy League schools have the better shot and so forth. You get maybe an over representation of that.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are a lot of hedge fund managers that go to Ivy League schools, but as far as the people I’ve interviewed they fall all over the map. Some dropped out of college in fact. It’s not necessarily just people that are book smart.</p>
<p>There’s a different type of intelligence that goes with trading. In some cases, it depends on methodology. If it’s a high quant methodology then sure, having a PHD from Princeton in mathematics is probably beneficial. Some guys are just several deviations off the IQ scale, no question super brilliant people.</p>
<p>But you have other traders who are not amount of book smarts, and maybe not using that type of analysis at all or any real quant stuff. They’ve just got a good feel for markets, and have a way of taking lots and lots of different facts, and distilling down what’s important.</p>
<p>A good representation of that might be someone like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Marcus_(trader)">Mike Marcus</a>. He’s no dummy. His Masters is in psychology, but he wasn’t a quant guy.</p>
<p>I remember, this was a story that I heard not from Marcus, I don’t know if it was Marcus that told me, but it may have been other traders in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodities_Corporation">Commodities Corp</a> that told me the story.</p>
<p>Helmut Weymar, the founder of the company, wrote a book on analyzing the cocoa market. Marcus’s comment about the book was that it, “was so complicated I couldn’t understand the cover.”</p>
<p>There’s a personal story here, which applies. I met Marcus, because when I was getting my first job as a Wall Street analyst the job I was taking, he was voluntarily vacating, because he was going to become a “Trader.”</p>
<p>He was leaving this analyst position to become a trader, and I met him when I was coming in. We talked a little bit, and he was still in New York for a few years before he went out to Malibu, and we used to get together for lunch.</p>
<p>I remember this instance where I was an analyst. At that time, I was really a fundamental analyst, and I would cover a number of markets, one of which was cotton.</p>
<p>As a good little economic graduate, I did all the basic analysis. I went back. I studied the economics of every market in the post-World War II period, and decided that there were only three or four markets at that time that would qualify as free markets.</p>
<p>In all the other years, the government program kicked in and distorted the price, so you really couldn’t tell what the true recoil of your price would have been. I was left with just those three or four years, and then based on that analysis, really there wasn’t enough data to form an opinion.</p>
<p>That’s what I should have said, but I came up with the conclusion that that season was the most bullish, as bullish as the most bullish free market season we had. Prices were about 25 cents at the time, and the highest we’d ever had was somewhere in the mid-30s or whatever.</p>
<p>That was my projection, which was good as far as it went. I also believe that, once we got up to the mid-30s, it’s getting pretty high and the market’s fully priced. Here’s where the difference between someone like myself, who is doing things analytically, and Marcus comes in.</p>
<p>Marcus, and I were having lunch, and I was starting to short cotton. It was getting to that point where i felt it was fully priced.</p>
<p>Marcus says, “No, it’s going much higher.” The reason he thought so was because it was the first year that China, which was then called the PRC, was a buyer of cotton. There are a thousand facts out there about cotton, but he understood that this one fact, that the PRC was the buyer for the first time, changed everything.</p>
<p>He was absolutely right. Cotton didn’t stop at the mid-30s, mid-40s, mid-50s. It went all the way up to 99 cents, which was the highest price cotton had ever seen since the Civil War. He got it right, and he made a fortune on that market, even though I did a lot more analysis and more work, because he understood the one fact that mattered.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a D.E. Shaw or an Ed Thorpe to make money in the markets. It’s a different approach. His approach was one that worked for him, and he had that type of market intelligence that is not so much book smarts. It’s an intuitive smarts.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to non-professionals who would like to start trading?</strong></p>
<p>The process is first, read.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you what to read. Just go explore, whether it’s on the web or go to a library, go to a bookstore if you can still find one these days.</p>
<p>That’s a challenge in itself. However you do it, just pick up different things. Look at different things. See what they’re saying. You’ll find what you gravitate. Once you figure out where you’re gravitating to, read more on that.</p>
<p>Then start thinking about, on your own, start thinking about ideas based upon what you read. Start looking about how you might implement it in the market.</p>
<p>Watch the market. Take those ideas. Try different things.</p>
<p>Then eventually, we’ll try to evolve that into some sort of methodology that you could define rules with, come up with a risk management plan. Once you have that in place, paper trade. Paper trading’s not the same because you don’t have the emotional thing component, but it’s a way of checking whether you really have an edge.</p>
<p>If it seems like you do have an edge, then start with a small amount of money and implement it. That’ll make it real, and I say a small amount of money because most people will lose when they start trading.</p>
<p>You might as well get the education cheaper. No reason to do a $50,000 degree when you can get one for $5,000, so to speak.</p>
<p>Then of course, if you’re trading with real money successfully, then gradually increase it as you feel comfortable. That’s basically the line of progress that I would recommend.</p>

<p><em>This post was written for CFA Institute and first published on</em> <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/02/07/this-209-year-old-graph-will-teach-you-a-lot-about-global-growth/"><em>the Enterprising Investor</em></a><em>.</em> </p>
<p>It’s easy to forget that business and commerce have been around for a long time, in fact almost as long as civilization itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair">William Playfair</a> — who among other things, invented the bar chart — published a book in 1805 which investigated the causes of decline and fall of wealthy nations.</p>
<p>The chart below was in the very front of the book. It’s particularly provocative when read alongside modern attempts to look at the way that the economic productivity of countries changes over time, like this excellent <a href="http://www.investmenteurope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2013_yearbook_final_web.pdf">Yearbook of Investment Returns</a> from Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>Both excellent works serve as reminders that investors are well served by periodically remembering how dramatically things can change over time. In the graph below, the United States of America is newly ascendant in the international scene: a true emerging market. Russia, England, France, and Germany are the world’s economic powerhouses. China and India are not mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Chart of Universal Commercial History</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Chart_of_Universal_Commercial_History.jpg/1280px-Chart_of_Universal_Commercial_History.jpg"><img alt="Chart of Universal Commercial History" src="images/Universal-Commercial-History.png?resize=600%2C388" title="Image: https://i1.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2014/09/Universal-Commercial-History.png?resize=600%2C388"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>It’s amazing what can change in a few hundred years, or even in a few decades.</p>
<p>To choose an example of a drastic change closer to living memory, did you know there was a time when serious businesspeople doubted that a South Korean company could produce a microwave? In “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Silent-War-Business-Americas/dp/0679728279">The Silent War</a>“, a 1990 book about the future of competition in business, the author details what Samsung had to overcome in order to compete.</p>
<p>A glance at their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics#Market_share">market share</a> in products that require highly advanced manufacturing processes, like hard drives and flash memory, makes it almost funny that there exists in living memory a time when serious businesspeople were skeptical they could pull something like that off. In the 45 years since Samsung’s founding, the competitive landscape in business has altered so much it is barely recognizable.</p>
<p>The investment ramification of this walk through history is straightforward: what’s changing under your feet?</p>

<p>This section will trace the construction of CRISIL, an institution central to India's economic development.</p>
<p>The second part of this interview resonated unusually deeply with me, as I hope it will with you. It is a tangible example of how innovation in finance can make life better despite every complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s talk a little about CRISIL, because first of all, I have to say, you must be very proud to have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doing-what-right-CRISIL-Story/dp/9382618074">a book</a> written about a thing that you built with the subtitle, “Doing What is Right.” I would guess that that’s something of a point of pride.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, indeed. I suggested the idea at first in 1986. In 1981, I came back from Harvard, and then I realized that there was a need for something like this.</p>
<p>My then Chairman, who I helped set up another retail housing finance company, which was also the first retail housing finance company in the country, and which is a household name, Housing Development Finance Corporation.</p>
<p>I was working there, and my Chairman wouldn’t let me go. It took me about a year-and-a-half to get his permission. I was given leave of absence, just as I was given leave of absence from ICICI to start HDFC. I was then given leave of absence from HDFC to start CRISIL, and I was supposed to go back to my parent organization.</p>
<p>At that time, interest rates were not differentiated under risk. They were administered. It was like a binary, if somebody was found creditworthy, they got money at a particular rate, and there was no differentiation amongst different borrowers, and their capability to pay back.</p>
<p>A lot of people were not given any money at all, because they were just seen to be black, as we call it, not white or whatever. They were not good. A white was good. There were no shades of gray in between, we realized that they would need to start differentiating on the base of credit risk. There was a need to educate the regulators to free up the administrative mechanism.</p>
<p>People didn’t understand the concept of yield to maturity. Would you believe that, in bonds? Forget yield to call, yield to put, because those call and put bells and whistles didn’t really come out in debentures, but they just took the funds at the rate, because it enabled administered interest rates so there was not seen to be volatility in the interest rate environment.</p>
<p>We had to educate not only the regulators, but issuers of debt, investors in debt. A large number of people, and again, don’t forget we have illiterate people who still have savings.</p>
<p><strong>Of course.</strong></p>
<p>We have low-educated people who still have savings who want some guidance. We have, of course, the sophisticated intermediaries, and investors. They all needed guidance, and our thought was to create awareness of the concept of credit rating amongst a diverse set of people, and four basic constituents, issuers, investors, intermediaries, and regulators, and address different needs.</p>
<p>One of the most heartening things that I found, we developed a strategy. We had very small capital. We started with 14 million of capital at today’s rate of exchange it would be about $700,000 of capital, and we had to survive…it was a commercial venture! We had no ability to educate through advertising and promotion. I would take every opportunity to address gatherings.</p>
<p>I must have addressed several 100 gatherings in the first two years of the chamber of commerce or institute of chartered accountants, or gathering of business people or whatever, Rotary Clubs, whichever, because it was a new concept. We took the opportunity to be interviewed in the press, because it was a new concept.</p>
<p>Something clicked in the press, and we articulated it well. It got the attention of people, and we took advantage of that to create awareness, and spread the concept widely.</p>
<p>Our strategy was to get strong companies, which were perceived to be strong companies, to begin using the ratings. We figured that they would start spreading the word, that they were the highest of high quality and so on. That was exactly what we did.</p>
<p>We got high companies, or high quality companies come in the first three months. We started spreading the word by advertising. At least we got a flood of inquiries, “What does this mean? How does it work? We also think we are very strong, why don’t we get the same rating?” And so on.</p>
<p>We developed a methodology, which was different from Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s in one or two key respects. The one key respect that essentially was required, was that we decided that we would not work only for investors. We would work for issuers, as well as investors. As well as I told you, the regulator and intermediaries.</p>
<p>Our philosophy was not one against the other; our philosophy was to help make the market function better, as you put it. What we said was that, if a company comes to us, an issuer of debt comes to us, wants a rating, and then doesn’t like the rating….They will be free not to use it, we won’t spread the word. We would bury that rating quietly.</p>
<p>In that case, we would give them our analytical feedback, as to what the rating was, and why it was so. For instance, if the operating leverage was too low, the financial leverage was too high, or they didn’t have succession plans, or the poor governance was contrary to what we thought it would be.</p>
<p>For instance, just as an example, there was a company which was selling trucks. Then an associate company which was in the business financing, trucks which these guys made. The board of that associate company was controlled essentially by the truck manufacturer.</p>
<p>We immediately found out that, there was a lack of proper governance. That the board was naturally biased towards supporting this truck manufacturer, as a sales tool for the parent, rather than operating for the good of the shareholders of the finance company.</p>
<p>There were conflicts: In some cases, prudence would indicate not financing somebody for whatever reason. This would mean depriving their parent, or affiliate company, (the truck manufacturer) of business. So be it.</p>
<p>We pointed out these kinds of things, and people loved it. No one had talked to them as frankly, as honestly. Never used to, even the biggest of industries. They were used to getting their way with the banks and institutions, and we stood up to them.</p>
<p>We said, “No you are not triple AAA, or you are not single A.” We also gave junk ratings to some. We never did it in a way that would give them the message that, you are doing a disgusting job. We said, oh, look this is what it comes out, you come out as junk. “Perhaps it’s not right to go into the market in this region, because you won’t get money.”</p>
<p>“You would unnecessarily, tell everyone that you are not credit worthy. Maybe, it’ll affect your banking title. Why don’t you do things? Why don’t you raise capital or bring equity? You use this leverage. Shed off this dividend, and create liquidity for yourself.” Et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>We give them ideas like consultants, and that worked very, very well. We used to get postcards. Postcards from individuals, from Himachal, or Orissa or something saying, “What is the credit rating rate? I’m putting my fixed deposit here. Can you tell us?”</p>
<p>In different languages, and I put some sampling of this in a photograph form in one of my annual reports. Just to tell the world how pleased we were. That we were actually helping out the poor. You are helping out innocent people, who have no ability to make judgments, and here they were responding like this.</p>
<p>Postcards, postcard is the cheapest way of communicating. In those days it used to be five paisa at one time, and five paisa is what a fraction of cent. One cent is 80 paisa. It’s a fraction of a cent, and then it begins 15 paisa.</p>
<p>They couldn’t afford anything better. They would write in their own language, Oriya, or Punjabi, or whatever and say, “Can you please tell us the rating and we would…” We were reaching out through the strategy of asking come, or not asking, or encouraging them. Not even encouraging. Giving a reason for companies to tell the world of their ratings.</p>
<p>Even when companies was rated not in the highest, we told them that, “Look, but don’t forget. You can tell the world that you are better than your competitors. Your competitors don’t even have a rating. How would they know what your competitor rating is?” Put pressure on your competitors by even announcing your Single A rating, for instance.</p>
<p>Different arguments that suited them, but it was always designed as a win-win situation, never working for one and against the other. That was a very fundamental characteristic of us. And we, of course didn’t make any major mistakes.</p>
<p>Our fee structure was such. We divided it in such a way that it was progressive. That we built it on the size of the issuer, that it became relatively affordable for even the smallest company, to come in and seek a rating. The fee for annual maintenance would also be affordable.</p>
<p>Additionally, we were quite brutal about downgrading or not agreeing to their viewpoint if the rating merited so. If the circumstances were poor.</p>
<p>As well, our team was young, we got excellent people from the Indian Institute of Management.</p>
<p>At Calcutta we were the number one choice for the youngsters there. Indian Institute of Bangalore, we were the number one choice. In Indian Institute of Management we were not number one, but I managed to get a lot of people from Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, who had worked elsewhere as well.</p>
<p>For instance, Roopa Kudva, who is now the CEO. She came to see me in 1992. As she recounted to me, when she was appointed to managing director or CEO of the company. One day she called me up that evening, and I hadn’t talked to her for some time.</p>
<p>I was very surprised that, “Oh! Wonderful to hear from you.” She said, “Look, I just came out from the board meeting. I have been appointed the managing director. I wanted to also tell you that, and you won’t remember this, that in 1992 when I came to see you, I didn’t have an appointment. You not only saw me, you gave me a job.” That was the way we operated.</p>
<p>If we saw a good person, we wouldn’t let that person go out of the door. Take the job back here. The people had tremendous freedom. In our rating committee meetings, everyone was equal.</p>
<p>We had a wide rating committee. Full of brilliant people, but anyone could chip in and argue with the committee or with any performance rating team. “Look, you are wrong. You are giving too high rating, or too low rating or whatever.”</p>
<p>There would be free discussions. This I saw from my own work experience in that time, that if you allow youngsters, who of course have the capability within them. But, give them the freedom to express themselves without fear without favor, without any bias and anger. They would want to present their best foot forward. They would have to defend themselves in front of peers.</p>
<p>That competitive spirit, without malice, was important. There would be no malice. There was no personal agenda, no angers for anyone. In a peer group, defending a rating or arguing for ones viewpoint, made for superb judgment, and superb outcomes in our rating decision. I was very happy in such a culture of honesty and integrity.</p>
<p>That sort of has prevailed. “Do what is right” is what the book says. That was a sort of philosophy in which CRISIL operated. It continued, and CRISIL was very highly thought of everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>That’s very cool, and in many ways is quite aligned with the way we think at CFA Institute. We obviously exist to <a href="http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/future/pages/index.aspx">help global markets function better</a>, with the ultimate hope that we would have some of the same outcomes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to ask: It seems like it’s all well and good to go and define a culture of honesty, and say that you are going to seek and aspire to certain values. How do you really implement something like that?</strong></p>
<p>Our attempt was to get good people, good, competent, and honest to the best of our ability. We make quick judgments. Don’t forget we didn’t have the luxury and liberty of elaborate interviews and so on. We were growing so fast at one stage, not only that, we would lose people, because unfortunately we were not not the best paymasters at that time.</p>
<p>We first we got a person that we could get, then we focused on systems, processes, and culture. This was our philosophy. That the process, the methodology for rating for instance, had to be comprehensive. There were no cutting corners whatsoever.</p>
<p>If they were a company with 17 plants, we may not visit maybe more than two or three plants, but it was important to understand the culture in the organization. Whether they were cost-conscious, whether they looked over manned. Whether they lived clean, kept a focus on safety and so on.</p>
<p>Although, assessments were being made by visits of a sample nature, Ratings were never given without meeting with the CEO and understanding the management philosophy. It was critical to understand the goals and ideals and their willingness to pay debt on time. With regard to ability, we could make judgment from past history, and product history and quality and so on so forth.</p>
<p>Making judgment of willingness, was also very, very important for us. That’s why we always had these management meetings. In some large companies, you would have meetings with as many as 50 people in an organization.</p>
<p>Different heads of department, from HR people, from marketing to production, to, of course the finance and so on. It was a very comprehensive rating methodology, and it had served CRISIL in good sense and continued methodology. The rating has stood the test of time.</p>
<p>It is now a 26 year old company, and it is doing very well. When I left it, it was the largest rating agency east of the Atlantic. A concept which was not started by us. It was learned from America, we adapted it. We were invited to give know-how to Israel.</p>
<p>Israel had all the opportunity and the offers from the US rating agency, to help them in every detail. They didn’t go anywhere with all the help. They came to us, and we gave them the know-how and they were so pleased. They planted a garden of 100 trees in my name.</p>
<p>I remain friends even now with the founder, who is now a retired person, but still is a professor of residence in Tel Aviv University. We gave know-how to Malaysia. Again, the rating agency there was started, but it wasn’t going anywhere. We helped them get going, and it has been a very, very successful operation we are told.</p>
<p><strong>There’s an anecdote in the book that I find striking. It’s given in the book as being potentially a myth. I guess it just seemed like it characterized these rating meetings appropriately. There’s this senior CRISIL person, who is walking somebody from S&amp;P around the floor of the offices, to sort of show them what the company is capable of. The great capabilities of CRISIL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They walk by a conference room, and there is a senior guy, just laying into a junior guy with the uttermost vehemence. It looked, to this guy, like there was an emergency. He actually goes, “Oh! I didn’t realize you had something urgent to attend to. We can continue doing this later.” Then the guy who is showing him around goes, “Oh, no, no, no. This is routine. It happens all the time.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then the junior guy that he was laying into, starts giving it right back to him. That seems so remarkable.</strong></p>
<p>It is symbolic of the culture. As I said, our rating committees were a treat. There was a design in that rating committee process. It was multi-layer.</p>
<p>For instance, if we knew the rating would be originating in the branch. In that branch, the team would have to present their findings to an internal committee there, and it would help even our judgment. No bullying, no pressure.</p>
<p>The team’s decision would of course be final, but surely they would have learned something from peers and so on. They would give contributions, because they were required to, and obligated to, and of course competent enough to do so.</p>
<p>Then we would come to our rating committee, and in the rating committee, we would have a full house. Whoever was present, was not only invited, whoever was professional was not only invited to, but obligated to attend.</p>
<p>It was like a small town hall meeting, in a boardroom. We would have about 30, 40 people sometimes, crowded and sitting in on the rating. No secrecy, no conspiracy, but fairly learning from each other as it were.</p>
<p>A presentation on a shipping company for instance, and the rating of the shipping company would be critiqued by someone who may not have been associated with shipping, but that person learned something.</p>
<p>Then would certainly have something to say, perhaps on the financial matters and the cash flow and so on, and they might comment on that, or might not comment, but just sit in and listen.</p>
<p>Putting the rating presentation in front of peers, as well as their seniors in the rating committee itself, made people put their best foot forward.</p>
<p>There was complete freedom, not only freedom, but it was encouragement and obligatory. If somebody knew something better than whoever is speaking, he or she was not only allowed, but encouraged to speak their mind.</p>
<p>As I said, always in the interest of the subject on end, never personal, no malicious intent, no vested interest. Those were not there. To my mind, that was one of the secrets of our rating outcomes, and secret of the culture that was created. Absolutely transparent, free, frank, no manipulation.</p>
<p>When we started this rating business, we were seeking desperately, association in national organization, and so on. We started with Standard and Poor’s, and they would not allow me beyond their reception.</p>
<p>Moody came and surveyed the market at our institute at ICICI. They said to us finally that, “Look, rating is an art and a science. You don’t have the art, you don’t have the science. Sorry, we can’t help you. If you want to do credit rating like Dunn &amp; Bradstreet does, we would be happy to help you out.”</p>
<p>We said, “Sorry, we are looking for capital market ratings.” We had IFC Washington, the International Finance Corporation, which was really the great private sector supporter of India, through its foreign know-how, and money and so on so forth.</p>
<p>They wrote in a letter, that they did not have confidence, they would not participate because number one, Indian industrialists would browbeat this company, and get the ratings of their choice, and it would lose its credibility. Second, we just didn’t have the know-how.</p>
<p>We had to prove them wrong. I was 34, when I was asked to take up the rating agency. I took it as a personal challenge I said. My great chairman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narayanan_Vaghul">Mr. Vaghul</a> who backed it. He was the chairman of ICICI.</p>
<p>He said, “All right, you know if you are ready to go, then go.” [laughs] Because, I told him, I said “Sir, why do we go with the second best? With someone who doesn’t understand, we would go on our own and do it.” He said, “All right.” He put his weight behind it. His name was on the line. I was a young chap, if I stumbled people they would have said, “OK. What do you expect of this guy?”</p>
<p>He had the vision and the courage to back me, and I think it worked very well.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful Pradip. It’s very impressive, and certainly a great book to read. Thank you so much for speaking to us.</strong></p>

<p><em>This was written for CFA Institute and first published on</em> <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/12/05/special-report-building-an-india-resistant-to-currency-shocks-and-inflation/"><em>the Enterprising Investor</em></a><em>.</em> </p>
<p>Inflation, currency shocks, and their unequal impact on the Indian population as a whole have been brought up repeatedly in this week’s <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/12/02/special-report-what-is-india-and-what-is-its-future/">coverage of India</a>.</p>
<p>In part one of a two-part interview with <a href="http://www.indasiafund.com/inner.asp?url=aboutus.htm&amp;param=credentials.htm" title="Link: http://www.indasiafund.com/inner.asp?url=aboutus.htm&amp;param=credentials.htm">Pradip Shah</a>, the founding managing director of Crisil, Chairman at IndAsia Fund Advisors, and a board member at several India-based companies, we discuss how India has recovered from currency shocks, how it might recover further, and the progress of various initiatives that have been undertaken to mitigate the impact of those factors on India’s vast population living in poverty. <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/follow-the-enterprising-investor/">Subscribe</a> to ensure you don’t miss part two, and consider attending the India Investment conference if your schedule accommodates.</p>
<p><strong>CFA Institute: Pradip, India is perhaps unique in that it’s a country that’s raising rates to try and to control inflation. From where I’m sitting in New York, and maybe from where the Fed governors are sitting across the country, some inflation would be OK for us as long as it got us some growth. How do you see the growth-inflation trade-off in India? Is it the same sort of consideration?</strong></p>
<p>Pradip Shah: At this time, there is certainly a trade off. They are addressing inflation in a manner that is depressing growth because the Reserve Bank of India has taken on all the burden of fighting inflation, through tight money and dear monetary policy.</p>
<p>As a consequence, because of high interest rates, we’ve seen a slow down of big ticket purchases by consumers, such as housing, or consumer durables or automobiles, and so on.</p>
<p>Not only that, tight monetary policy has discouraged investment. We had, at one time I think, 38 percent of the GDP in Investment, which has probably fallen well  below 30 percent now. That’s not good for an economy which needs a lot of infrastructure development and possesses a lot of investment possibility.</p>
<p>We have population growth; we have an underserved population with infrastructure being very poor, whether it’s public transport, roads, whether it’s irrigation of water for both urban as well as rural, and so on. There are a lot of investments that can take place, but it does get inhibited by higher interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>One of the things that you mentioned is that, the central bank sort of sees its role as being the guardian of the purchasing power of the currency. There’s been some volatility in the rupee  to say the least. How should we been looking at that?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, there was a catch up provision in the rupee depreciation. Between 1991, when we had the big bang of reforms, and 2001, the Indian currency depreciated by about 4.6 percent per year. The 10 years thereafter it depreciated only by about 2.6 per year. If you even extend it to early August, the depreciation was about 2.7 percent.</p>
<p>Now, 2.7 percent per year is less than the interest rate differential. There is an inflation differential between the dollar economy, and the Indian rupee economy. There was a catch up. For instance, look at August 2011, just a little over two years ago: the rupee appreciated to about 38 rupees to the dollar, it clearly went the other way. All on the back of financial flows, and a thin currency market.</p>
<p>Now, it went the other way at 68 rupees. When suddenly there was a lack of confidence triggered by the main announcement by Bernanke that they would begin to Taper QE3. Then many people started looking at all emerging markets in a different light. That caused a currency flight until the reserve bank got into the act.</p>
<p>In the mean time, some of us had been screaming for import duties. Import duties were introduced on gold, which took away 60 million dollars of currency when Individuals purchased gold.</p>
<p>The highest amount of gold purchases came about last year, in terms of gold being bought as ETFs, gold bouillon, bar form, non jewelry gold. This is clearly intended a store of value. People were shifting to gold, because of the inflation.</p>
<p>We were arguing for import duties. Duties helped bring about current deficit reduction, but, in addition, the reserve bank took three very interesting steps which were very useful.</p>
<p>Firstly, they took off 144 billion dollars of annual import demand of oil from the currency market. That dollar demand, 12 billion dollars a month, was far greater than the current account deficit. It tilted the currency market in favor of the rupee.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Reserve Bank of India entered into swap arrangements with other countries. For example, it entered into a 50 billion dollar swap with the Japanese government. That’s like having the Japanese government back us with 50 billion dollars in case of emergency. Of course, like reciprocity demanded, we will do the same if Japan got into a crisis. Fortunately, this worked for us, just not very well. It gave confidence, that there was money backing the reserve that the reserve bank already had.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the reserve bank opened up the foreign currency non-resident tap.</p>
<p>Again, I had argued for it in a meeting with the finance governor in June, July I wrote an article along those lines. But that governor changed and Raghuram Rajan came in, but that earlier governor announced that, Yes, we’ll open up the reserve. Exactly as I suggested.</p>
<p>They gave an incentive to banks to tap into the network that they already had in the Middle East, places where the <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/12/03/indias-importance-abroad-the-rise-of-the-indian-diaspora/">Indian Diaspora</a> exist in large numbers. The idea was to give the banks a little incentive by setting off liabilities and limits on foreign currency deposits.</p>
<p>The governor, currently, Raghuram Rajan did one better. He said to the banks, “<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/16/us-india-rupee-deposits-exclusive-idUSBRE98F0E120130916">Go out, raise money from non-resident Indians by way of foreign currency non-resident deposits, and you can swap that into rupees for 3.5 percent cost per year.</a>” Now, that was very attractive. Given the current low interest rate environment in dollars worldwide, we’ve got banks that are able to borrow money at about five percent.</p>
<p>They have 3.5 percent hedge cost, and the banks have an all in rupee cost at 8.5 percent, which they can easily lend out for two or three percent more than that. There’s a very attractive window that’s been created which brought in 10 billion dollars in one month’s time. By November 30th when it ends, it will bring at least another 10 billion dollars. The reserve bank has realized that it can open the tap.</p>
<p>More importantly, this signals to the market that it should not take rupee depreciation for granted. We have tools in our armory to address very sudden or spiky depreciation. Rupee depreciation hurts us. It adds to inflation.</p>
<p>It fuels inflation because we import 70 percent of our oil. That’s very important, because oil is needed to move the economy. Think about everything we do with diesel: from things as simple as bringing vegetables home to more complex things.</p>
<p>If diesel goes up in price, of course, your inflation increases. Our whole motto, our whole objective is to control inflation. We can’t allow the rupee to slide without concern. We will monitor it. The reverse bank still articulates that they don’t have a target rupee dollar rate in mind, but they’ve said that if it is seen to be excessive, they will control it.</p>
<p>They’ve brought it to around 61.5 to 62 rupees to the dollar. The government would have ideally liked it at 60. The finance minister went on record, which perhaps did a little bit of a job on the market, saying that the rupee should have been at 58 rupees to the dollar. That’s a fair rate. Perhaps at 60 or 61 rupee, it would seem that the rupee has caught up with the inflation differential, and this reflects a true value in purchasing power parity.</p>
<p>Unless we have a currency pull out or investment leaving or entering India in uncontrolled quantities, we should see an orderly currency movement. That’s in respect to investment, again, of course. If the rupee seems to be relatively stable, if we didn’t have a current account deficit, that would be wonderful. That would have been a blessing.</p>
<p>But we still have a current account deficit. Having controlled the gold import, we think the current account deficit will come down to about three, 3.5 percent, from what we had at 6 percent at one time.</p>
<p><strong>Well, there are two things that I really want to pick up on there. The first that you alluded to is sort of the power of the Indian diaspora, which I think is something that is difficult to appreciate for those of us who may not be as familiar.</strong> </p>
<p>Can you just sort of touch on this notion that, because of emigration trends that you’ve seen as a country over the last 50 odd years, that there is this wealthy network of foreigners who may have other citizenships, but who certainly feel allied to India in some way. Do you feel that that’s going to be a material driver?</p>
<p>Yes. You have a wonderful opportunity in India to tap some of this Indian diaspora overseas. There is, for instance, a floating diaspora, as I say, which is in the Middle East. Which went to build the Middle East, from labor, construction labor to professional bankers, and asset managers, technical specialists, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>For them to get citizenship is almost impossible. They earn a lot, save a lot, and typically the workers all submit money to India to support their families. We have about 72 billion dollars in just remittances coming into India, which helps us in our current account. These remittances are good for household expenses of the families here.</p>
<p>There is that strata of the diaspora, not only in the Middle East but also in Southeast Asia, Singapore, and Malaysia, and of course even in the Western world in the United Kingdom, the United States.</p>
<p>We have a large body of, for instance, yuppies who have gone for IT services overseas. We have a large body of first generation Indians who still have family here and have close contact with family here, and who therefore have grown up on Indian household names and feel very comfortable with the names, who are not averse to putting money into safe investments in India especially in fixed income category, especially if it’s denominated in the currency of their choice.</p>
<p>The diaspora can be that. It’s the second generation, the earlier generation which took roots in India, and then their children are born abroad. The children don’t have any affinity to India, they don’t think Indian. Although they may look Indian, they don’t think Indian. They perhaps don’t have any, as it were, longing for home.</p>
<p>There was a phase when they were lost youngsters wanting to come back to India, even though they were born and brought up, for instance, in the United States, and had the best of education, Harvard and MIT, and so on. But they wanted to work here, because India was seen about five years ago as such a great growth market, and nothing could go wrong with India, they wanted to come back to work.</p>
<p>That also may happen again, if we improve the climate and livability for people in India.</p>
<p><strong>The other thing I want to drill in on, is the notion that you raised that India imports this massive amount of oil. I wonder sort of on the geo-political front, the extent to which we might see India making moves to secure access to those resources. Do you think that’s a primary consideration?</strong></p>
<p>India has not gone as systemically as China has, towards securing natural resources overseas for its needs. Partly, because India does not have nearly Tree Trillion dollars of reserves. They have 300 billion dollars of reserves, which is about seven months of imports. They need to shepherd that carefully.</p>
<p>What they have done, nevertheless, is encourage public sector companies like ONGC, India Oil and Natural Gas Commission as well as for instance, Coal India, and so on, to look overseas for assets.</p>
<p>For instance, we had about 85 million tons of coal imports last year. Though we have one of the largest producers of coal in the world, we will need continually increasing coal imports to power our energy requirements. We need to build up those kinds of resources, and if we had the ability to generate current account surpluses, it would be less of a problem.</p>
<p>But still, we have energy dependence on overseas nations. We will need to be careful in how we’re spending our resources, and buying assets overseas will help us in at least in securing our future without having to be at the mercy of our currency that goes against us all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. That can be reasonably severe. Let’s talk about onions. If you’re in New York, onions are 69 cents a pound, which is maybe 0.0000013 percent of annual household income. I noticed onion prices in India are up 300 percent. That would seem to be material to the average Indian person.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed. I forget the figure just now, but the amount spent by the common man, as it were, the average person in India, is roughly 31 percent on just food supplies. Other non-discretionary items like healthcare and transportation also take up a lot. Discretionary spending is much more limited than, even say, China, for instance.</p>
<p>When you have such a large portion of your income being taken away by just food, and you’re not eating as well as the Western world in terms of either calories or nutritional value to begin with, any food price hurts. Don’t forget we have roughly 30 percent of our population, or if the government is to be believed much less, I think it’s 29 to 30 percent is fair estimate, of people living below the poverty line.</p>
<p>The government has gone so far as to say “Look, we have actually passed a bill, passed an act to help out the poor in India by giving them subsidized food products.” That subsidy program does serve almost two-thirds of the population. When you have onion and other essential food prices rise, it is the biggest punishment or tyranny toward poor people.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. In thinking about the subsidy programs. I remember reading a lot in “The Economist” a couple years ago, about a massive identification program that was underway in India. Is the government able to identify the people who receive the subsidies now? Is there a reasonably complicated implementation problem there, that’s sort of tough to get your hands around?</strong></p>
<p>If the unique identification program is designed for subsidy, I think it needs to be tweaked. What happens today is that to get a unique identification number, you have to produce some paper or identity document which says you exist in the country.</p>
<p>Even if you particularly present yourself and the system allows them to allow five biometric measurements of yours to be recorded, the government has not said that you exist!</p>
<p>This stage of implementation seems wrong. It says that, “Oh, have you got a ration card, have you got driving license, have you got a passport, et cetera, then yes, we’ll take these five biometrics, and say OK, you are the same person as the passport or whatever says.” That’s the way it is being implemented.</p>
<p>The government wants to implement this as they implement subsidies in terms of passing this person through the UID mechanism, having identified the person.</p>
<p>They would then allow the person to open the bank account, and then the money would be credited to the bank, to enable them to get subsidy as it were, and then buy food products.</p>
<p>Now this subsidy program in this manner is unlikely to work. It is going to work for bookkeeping purposes for the government, in that the budget will say, “Yes, we have provided so much subsidy.” One could argue that it might work, I guess, I can guarantee you it won’t the way it’s being designed, because look at it.</p>
<p>There are obvious issues. Firstly, to open a bank account is so dramatic for the poor. They are illiterate people. You’re not talking about a few 100. You’re talking about a few millions of people, tens of millions of people who are illiterate, or are unable to fend for themselves, either because they’re handicapped or don’t have support, because they don’t understand the language.</p>
<p>You have 21 languages, and how do you reach out to all of the communities even using the same language. It’s very difficult to reach out, and get them to fill out these monumental forms. These “Know Your Customer” requirements have become such holy cows.</p>
<p>Do you think those poor people have time to fill out the forms, or have the ability to fill out the forms to open a bank account? Then it’s been said, we know it. That’s why you find. For instance, they don’t invest in financial instruments as much as you would like.</p>
<p>They’re going to gold because it’s so easy to buy. You don’t have to show your identity. Even if they open a bank account, then how do you insure that the subsidy reaches out to the poor, for whom it is targeted?</p>
<p>For instance, in a family of four, let’s say, or six, where the husband may go to collect the money, and drink it before he reaches home. How do you make sure that there are three brothers don’t fight among themselves, and say, “Look. You’ve taken away more of my share,” because it’s not as if each individual existing in India will get the subsidy credits to that individual’s account.</p>
<p>It will go to the head of a family, or to the heads of the family, or whatever. It’s going to be, unfortunately, a deduction in welfare at the end of the day if they implement this subsidy program to these cash transfers. That would work in a small economy, where you can accurately identify or give an identity card to an individual here with unique identity.</p>
<p>The number doesn’t give an identity card, as it were. It confirms that you exist, but not give you a, “OK. Here, you didn’t have a passport. You didn’t have any of documents to prove that you exist, but you’re obviously living. Here is your identity card.” It doesn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. I’m going to add. I found that as somebody who speaks, English in India, I was as able to communicate out in the countryside as colleagues of mine who were native Indians, and spoke two or three languages just by speaking slowly in English.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 21 languages issue would seem to be massive, and underappreciated, but as well, it may seem like it’s not, necessarily, an investment consideration at first blush. If we consider India, and consider the growing middle-class argument, and consider the notion that as these people rise from unbelievable poverty they’ll become consumers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It would seem like the impediments like these are critical considerations. Do you think that there is a credible plan in place to address all of these things or do you think that it seems to be, basically, working itself out?</strong></p>
<p>I think the concepts are good. The concept of, for instance, rural employment guarantees, the concept of a unique identity card, very good concept!</p>
<p>But in a country with 1.25 billion people, with such a high illiteracy such that connectivity, whether by good, or by electronic, or communication devices. How can you ensure justice to each and every person? It’s not going to be possible.</p>
<p>You won’t be fair to everyone. This program cannot work in the manner that design would take. If it was Singapore with five million people, of course it will work very well, but not with 1.25 billion people and this much illiteracy. Even today, adult illiteracy would be about 26 percent of the population.</p>
<p><strong>CFA Institute: If you think about the mental space that India occupied in the business landscape for a long time, it’s easy to consWhere it was a very compelling place to do business process outsourcing because of a cost advantage, and that cost advantage drove economic competitiveness. Do you think that perception is still operative?</strong></p>
<p>India exists on so many planes.</p>
<p>At one level, we have rocket science. We’ve just sent a rocket to Mars. We speak of our aspirations, our ambitions, and our capability. We have that kind of large population. 30 percent of our population is urban, and of that urban population at least 50 percent of it, which is still a very large number, would be considered excellent in education, skill levels, et cetera.</p>
<p>They compete with anyone in the world on almost all matters. For them the world is flat, as flat as it can be!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/bookshelf/the-world-is-flat">Mr. Freidman</a> comes, and interacts with them. Naturally he thinks this is the way India is going, but there is a large number that is still in the stone age phase, for instance.</p>
<p>How do you address their needs? How do you take care of their aspirations? How do you take care of that requirement? Forget want, but just needs and requirements.</p>

<h2 id="is-corporate-india-healthy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2013/12/04/is-corporate-india-healthy/">Is Corporate India Healthy?</a></h2>
<p>As we continue our special coverage of India, it becomes important to ask the obvious: How are Indian companies doing?</p>
<p>For that, we turn to the chief investment officer of SBI Mutual funds, <a href="http://www.sbimf.com/AboutUs/Fund_House_Expertise/Investment_Team/Navneet_Munot.aspx">Navneet Munot, CFA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I am looking at a report from the Reserve Bank of India that says corporate profitability — this is a broad group of corporations in India — is down about 2%. Now it’s still big — it’s one crore, 74 lakh crore rupees — but how does this make you feel about business fundamentals in India? Is it still a rosy picture?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navneet Munot, CFA</strong>:  There is a part of economy that has been impacted more badly, and that is the investment side of it. So companies in industrials and infrastructure, those are the ones who got impacted. But if you look at the latest results, there is another set of companies that have benefited from a weaker rupee. So those who are exporters, those who are into information technology, pharmaceuticals, engineering — they have benefited because of the weaker rupee.</p>
<p>There has been pressure, particularly in the financial sector, because given the downturn, there has been stress [over] the asset quality of the banking system. So financials have been a bit under pressure; though the banks are financial services company who cater to the retail market, they seemed to be chugging along well because the overall retail delinquencies have not increased much in this downturn.</p>
<p>By and large, I think the corporate profitability is bottoming out. Two things that kept pressure: One was that lot of people who expanded capacity, extrapolating the 9% growth that we were witnessing till 2008, came for a shock when the growth fell and the global environment turned very negative.</p>
<p>For them, there is lot of capacity which is yet to come on stream and then generate revenues and also because of the government’s slow decision making and [because] the political environment has resulted in lots of infrastructure projects which are at the last mile from lack of environmental clearance — land acquisition or forest clearance or several ministry bureaucratic clearances and they have been pending.</p>
<p>So that got impacted and also the pressure on margins because the raw material prices went through the roof, the labor cost in India was going up in excess of 15% and 20%, interest cost was going up, currency was weakening, so they got impacted on margins. But from here on, I believe, as the cycle turns, the asset turnover improves, and also the pressure on margin recedes, I see better days ahead for corporate profitability.</p>
<p><strong>I just want to drill in on one of those comments, which is, you mentioned basically companies that have dollar revenues and rupee expenses as being a particular bright point in this environment. Does that signal a return to sort of offshoring and business process outsourcing-based competitive structure for India, or is that just sort of a short-term thing?</strong></p>
<p>I think that’s quite structural because [when] all is said and done, India has an advantage in terms of having a large English-speaking, educated talent pool and the cost pressure has receded for them, while the global environment has turned positive with the growth reviving in the US and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>These companies have benefited, and also the rupee depreciation obviously is helping them. But we have other sectors who lost competitiveness between, let’s say, 2005 and 2008–2009, when our economy was doing very well, the labor cost and, as I previously mentioned, I think, the cost structure went up and the rupee was strong, so they lost competitiveness.</p>
<p>But we are seeing a renewed way of thrust on getting the competitiveness back and several sectors. Autos is a classic example, and we saw the two‑wheeler companies — the Bajaj Auto and then some others. We are gaining the market share in the world market.</p>
<p>Similarly, several companies in auto ancillaries and in engineering particularly — there are other factors where India has the advantage of R&amp;D skills and low-cost labor. Across sectors, a weak rupee is likely to help corporate India.</p>
<p><strong>You are talking about the changing international investment climate. That’s something that has fascinated me as I have kept digging into India. I wonder if you could comment on flows a little bit. How important and how closely you’re a domestic Indian investor, how closely are you watching international investors in equities and their flows in and out of the market, how material is that to you?</strong></p>
<p>They have been extraordinarily important because what happens is that foreign institutional investors now almost own 22% or so of the market cap of India. If you have adjusted for the floating stock — because a large part of the market cap is with the promoters, be it the government or the private entrepreneurs or some of the multinational companies, they own a substantial chunk of the floating stock. They are a large part of the daily volumes, and their flows dictate the market.</p>
<p>To put it simply, we dance to the tune of global investors who get, in turn, driven by the global liquidity and the global risk environment. Why it is that because we run a large current account deficit, obviously the country needs a huge amount of capital flows. The flows by these foreign investors impact the currency market, impact liquidity, and interest rates here and impact the sentiment in the equity market as well.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, the domestic savings — India has a very high household savings rate, but unfortunately a large part of that saving effect is not coming into the financial instruments but going into real assets like real estate and gold. The domestic investors are becoming very marginal players in the equity market, and that’s why the foreign investors, their flows, make all the difference.</p>
<p>If you can do a chart of last 15 or 20 years, every single year where foreign investors poured in money, the markets did well. In every year where foreign investors were sellers, market didn’t do well.</p>
<p>But I hope that going forward, domestic investors will start reallocating their savings into equities as equities are relatively becoming more attractive compared to the other asset classes and that equation may change going forward. But as of now, foreign investors are a very, very critical variable in the overall direction of our equity markets.</p>
<p><strong>I want to pick up on the current account deficit thought in a second, but first I want to go to the comment you had about domestic investors. Now, what really needs to happen in order to spur that growth in a domestic shareholder base basically? Is that something that’s just like a last-mile problem, similar to those infrastructure projects, or is that really a big challenge?</strong></p>
<p>A variety of things. In the last 20–25 years, domestic investors — just like anywhere else in the world, they came at the peak of the market. They didn’t have the experience with the equities. There were some structural flaws in the system where probably the retail investors didn’t make money.</p>
<p>Also, India didn’t have a very sustained long‑term bull market. We had markets that delivered exceptional return; next to the year 1992 are the years 1999, 2000, and then 2006–2007, but unfortunately, the retail investors came at the peak. They had bad experience, and generally, equity is still perceived as something that is very speculative.</p>
<p>Another structural factor is that we don’t have enough of 401(k) type pension plans or all the retirement savings infrastructure in place, where a good part of savings automatically go into the equity market, like in the US and some of the other parts of the world. India needs to get that right. The pension reforms have just begun, and I hope that over a longer period, given the demographics and the high savings rate, people will start investing a lot more into equity.</p>
<p>Though the infrastructure now is in place, I think in terms of whether the settlement cycle — in terms of dematerialization, the overall infrastructure of the stock exchange, corporate governance, the regulation — everything is in place, but somehow, as you mentioned, the last mile. People will need to be educated, and given the importance of the equity in their overall savings portfolio, to get inflation adjusted at times, once that is done, a lot of money can come into the market.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature is that two other asset classes where people have put money in the last 10–15 years — real estate and gold — both have done phenomenally well, even adjusted for the volatility and liquidity. That’s why [there is] this perception that it is always better to put money in real estate rather than a paper asset. That needs to change. Hopefully, I think it will change over a period of time.</p>
<p><strong>I just want to underscore for the audience that investing in gold is not just a 15-year-old trend in India. It seems like to me a 2,000- or 10,000-year-old trend. There is a cultural focus on doing that that may not be very clear to an international base of investors.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but in last couple of years, [it has] increased significantly as a percentage of our GDP: Gold imports just shot through the roof for the simple reasons that real interest rates were negative and consumer inflation was running much higher than the policy rates. And that led people into more physical assets, and then also something to do with the cycle that in the last decade, at least in the rupee terms, because the rupee deficit people made good money in gold.</p>
<p>Also another reason that — I am an Indian, so I have had a fascination for gold for 2,000 years, but having said that, in the last 20 years, we have built a very good financial market. We have built good infrastructure in terms of whether it’s banks or mutual funds, insurance companies who are reaching out to millions of investors. But still, the proportion of savings coming into financial assets has declined, particularly in last three four years, which is a bit worrisome for the policymakers and for us.</p>
<p><strong>That gets back to the current account deficit thought. I was actually just listening to Mr Shanmugaratnam — the head of the Monetary Authority of Singapore — talk about the role that a current account deficit can play. He makes the point that a current account deficit in and of itself is not intrinsically bad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you see the lighter side of a current account deficit, or is it the sort of thing that you and perhaps the market more broadly are viewing as kind of holding India back?</strong></p>
<p>As long as it’s manageable, as long as it doesn’t create extraordinary pressure on the currency market, it doesn’t lead to destabilization in financial markets, it doesn’t lead to some kind of instability in the overall macroeconomic environment, and it saw the signs between June and August when the Fed announced — or probably the Fed announced — the intention of tapering and the massive impact it could have not only on the financial markets in India but also on the sentiment in the real economy.</p>
<p>The current account deficit, it is a point where the funding becomes a day-to-day challenge that is quite worrisome. But a 1%–2% of current account deficit for a country like India, which needs to invest more than private saving, it is largely in order. If you think from a global perspective, a few countries have to run the current account deficit; if everybody runs current account surplus, it is building reserves. I think that may not be good.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, that’s definitely true. In places that need investment, that’s OK, that’s what a current account deficit is. You brought up the word “tapering.” I wanted to ask you, just how often do you think about that word? Because here in New York, we think about it quite a bit. But on the other side of the world, it may not be obvious how important is to you.</strong></p>
<p>We hear almost the same [as] what people sitting in New York [hear] because, ultimately, our markets are governed by what people in New York think. As I have mentioned earlier, the foreign investors are extremely critical for us, for the equity market, for currency, and for, recently, the bond market as well.</p>
<p>Tapering — at least in the very near term — makes some impact, but longer term, if you look at last 20 year,s every time the US Fed was increasing interesting rates or the US Federal Reserve was tightening its policy, it turned out to be good for the Indian markets.</p>
<p>The first few days or first few weeks, markets would tend to react negatively because that would mean less liquidity available in the market, but over a longer period, if the US economy is doing well, I think that generally augurs well for the Indian economy.</p>
<p>One is the trade linkages, probably whether it’s IT export, health care, or some of the other industries. And over a longer period, there is a bit of correlation between the Indian IFT [Institute of Foreign Trade], the Index of Industrial Production, and the US ISM [Institute for Supply Management], which may be 3‑ to 6-month lag. So, a revival in global growth is generally good for India.</p>
<p>But the market takes a few weeks to realize that fact, and then the first reaction, just in line with every other market in the world when Mr. Bernanke or Ms. Yellen talks about tapering, people perceive it a bit negatively. But my sense is that once the tapering starts, eventually it helps to be adding; if it is driven by strength in the US economy, I think that should be good for the Indian economy and markets.</p>
<p><strong>Does the same linkage apply to other monetary zones, or would you say that you are concerned with things coming out of the ECB [European Central Bank] as you might be with things coming out the Fed?</strong></p>
<p>If I remember correctly, it was January and February 2012 when it announced the LTRO [long-term refinancing operation], and the Indian market, despite an extremely challenging micro and political environment, markets went up 25% and for no reason but just that the ECB showed signs of printing a lot of money and then the LTRO money came into India.</p>
<p>We get a lot more impacted by global liquidity, the global central bank stance, and global risk on/risk off sentiments. They impact a lot our markets, at least in the very near term. Of course, in the longer term, logically it is corporate fundamentals and economic fundamentals that should drive the market, but in the interim, I think it’s the global liquidity that impacts a lot.</p>
<p><strong>I want to ask, is it challenging in that case to sort of search for value among these equities? And if you are in this environment where you have this essentially tidal international investor sentiment, how does that frustrate your hunt for adequate risk/reward for your investors inside of the country?</strong></p>
<p>It actually also creates an opportunity for a domestic investor. Somebody who has a slightly longer-term horizon and he can, rather than getting trade by the volatility which is induced by the behavior of global investors. Sometimes it creates good opportunity, so if these markets are rising just because the global liquidity environment is improving, you can be on the other side of the fence rather than vice versa. It creates an opportunity for those who can take advantage of the differential arbitrage.</p>
<p>Another aspect is that, in the last five years, we would have gotten more than $80 billion from foreign investors, while the domestic investors have continuously been selling in the market. Now a large part of this money, or a bulk of this money, has chased around 50 or 60 odd stocks, and it has created a valuation gap between so-called defensives and the cyclicals.</p>
<p>Some of the stocks that foreigners are chasing — the large mega-caps within the consumer, health care, IT, and in some of the private sector retail banks — the valuations have risen there, while the rest of the market, because the domestic investors are not buying the cyclicals, had become a lot cheaper. Now I am seeing a trend where the domestic investors are focusing on finding value within those stocks which are neglected by the foreign investors.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about finding value, there is obviously the chase for value through all the listed equities, but I think if you reach into your wallet, I assume that there are some rupees there. Is that a source of worry, a source of confidence, both, or neither? It hasn’t been an easy 18 months for you probably.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, basically for Indians, gold is a dollar as such somehow because if the domestic one is not doing well and you have higher inflation, then through the weakened currency, you get the benefit in your investment and in gold.</p>
<p>Maybe people don’t talk about it, but subconsciously, it is the global diversification. Talking about as an individual, your expenses are in rupee and then you are running in rupee, and the last couple of years, the income growth has been in line with the nominal GDP growth. So, people are that way, OK. We haven’t seen investors really chasing and trying to diversify into global assets or investing overseas. We haven’t seen that trend catching up.</p>
<p><strong>One of the comments in doing this research that really surprised me came from Pradip Shah when he said that the [Reserve Bank of India] now views its job as protecting the purchasing power of currency, which again sounds a bit weird here in New York. Is that your perception? Is that translating into action to really defend the rupee? And if so, is that action viewed as credible in the market?</strong></p>
<p>Exchange rate has not been a major factor driving the monetary policy for several years, but I think there are periods when the bouts of volatility in the exchange market lead the central bank to take monetary action.</p>
<p>Having said that, the stated objective over the years has been that they want to contain volatility rather than protecting a certain level of the currency. Two things that have been a lot of the point is there — the currency will be stable if perceived inflation is well behaved, and the new governor Mr. Rajan, he has been very clear on two things.</p>
<p>One is that the primary target has to be containing inflation, and not only the wholesale inflation because that gets driven by global commodities, but the consumer inflation that impacts every household. And second is India needs to rebuild savings, so the real rates have to stay positive for some time to induce savers to come back into financial assets, to come back into deposits.</p>
<p>That’s why we need slightly higher rates, while the government and businesses have been clamoring for the lower interest rates to support growth. He thinks that we need a balance between these objectives.</p>
<p><strong>That’s it. Switching over to sort of a debt outlook, I’ve heard some chatter about a downgrade, a debt downgrade, for India the country. My country got downgraded not too long ago, and everything seems to be very much the same. Is that something that seems likely plausible or overblown? What are your feelings on that?</strong></p>
<p>Two aspects — one is that the actual event of India getting downgraded to a junk status, I think, is very, very remote. The macrofundamentals are reasonably strong, and they don’t justify that India should be in the junk category.</p>
<p>If you look at the public debt to GDP, if you look at the — there are hardly any implicit liabilities of the government, unlike most of the other parts of the world, where a very little pension liability or medical liabilities that the government has. And also, I think, even the demographic, the growth potential, the overall strength of the financial sector at a very low leverage among the households — the household balance sheets are very strong.</p>
<p>By and large, corporate balance sheets are in reasonably decent shape. India getting downgraded to junk is very, very remote, I would say. Having said that, I remember one good thing that has happened because of the threat of the downgrade; [it] has done lot of good to the country in a sense that the central government, despite this being an election year, it has been behaving very sensibly on the fiscal side because it knows that the sword of downgrade is hanging on us.</p>
<p>Because of that, the fiscal deficit has been under control, and serious reforms to consolidate the fiscal side, the budget deficit, began a year back. And I think some part would have been played by the threat of the sovereign rating downgrade of India.</p>
<p>Also, lots of reforms are taking place in the financial sector. The government has taken a lot of steps to revive growth and contain deficit. That’s a good aspect of this threat. But the actual event, I’ll be highly surprised. I’ll be shocked if S&amp;P [Standard &amp; Poor’s] takes the step and says that India doesn’t deserve an investment grade.</p>
<p>One more aspect that people neglect is that the bulk of the Indian government’s borrowing is in the domestic market. It has borrowed from the domestic banks and the households, and it has not borrowed overseas. That way, the vulnerability of India defaulting to global investors is hardly there. I’ll be very surprised if that event takes place. That’s a little overblown in that sense.</p>
<p><strong>That is certainly, probably, refreshing news to many investors. Navneet, thank you so much for joining us.</strong></p>
