<p><em>I wrote this essay for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Read any further and chocolate might not taste so good.</p>
<p>Same with shrimp. And I guess I should also mention there’s a decent chance your new t-shirt or skirt won’t look as nice either.</p>
<p>Because especially if you’re buying the cheap stuff, the odds are excellent that a slave is somewhere in the economies of scale that brought it to you. And I mean the strong form of slave: A human who is bought and sold.</p>
<p>Depressingly, this holds for almost any kind of “cheap stuff” you might care to discuss.</p>
<p>And that brings me to the part of the story that’s uniquely applicable to investors: where we have risk, opportunity, and indeed a chance to de-slave the world.</p>
<p><strong>That’s probably worth it, right?</strong></p>
<p>But I’m writing about this here, so something should be obvious. The case against slavery is about more than just morality. It’s also about money and a material risk to a broad cross section of widely owned businesses that is underappreciated, potentially disastrous, and (in time) easily mitigated.</p>
<p>So that’s why I’m not trying to knock you off the fence on the question of whether people buying and selling other people is your fight.</p>
<p>The point is that, unless you’re careful, it might be your business.</p>
<p>Before I get to how pervasive it is, let’s take a second to keep in mind the investment environment of the day: <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/07/18/18/11/NA07192016-IMF-Cuts-Global-Growth-Forecasts-on-Brexit-Warns-of-Risks-to-Outlook">Growth is not that easy to find</a>. <a href="https://vimeo.com/174632137">Risks are</a>. Whatever stocks may be at the moment, they are not cheap in most of the developed world. And at this point, it’s kind of an article of faith that <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/09/21/introducing-the-unterest-rate/">someday, somehow, interest rates will return</a>.</p>
<p>When stocks are fully valued, reducing risk is a value-creating act.</p>
<p>Interest rates are low. Equity markets are open. Money is reasonably priced and available for most large companies. So now let’s talk about slavery.</p>
<p><strong>It’s pervasive.</strong></p>
<p>Almost <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm">21 million people live in slavery today</a>, according to the International Labor Organization (ILO).</p>
<p>That’s the lowest estimate I was able to find. If all 21 million were gathered in one place, they would compose one of the largest cities in the world.</p>
<p>The US Department of Labor (DOL) maintains a (likely incomplete) <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/">list of goods produced with forced labor or child labor</a> broken down by country.</p>
<p>Fifty-five goods are made or acquired using forced labor in 37 different nations, the DOL reports. Coal, cotton, coltan, and cocoa are some of the raw materials harvested through that labor. So it’s conceivable slavery made it into your clothing or perhaps even the circuits that you are using to read this.</p>
<p>And that’s just the letter “C.”</p>
<p>The problem — the reason people capture, trade, and own slaves — is that their stolen potential has monetary value. A t-shirt that was produced by people working against their will looks the same as one that wasn’t. So does a diamond, a Christmas ornament, or a children’s toy.</p>
<p>This is a good time to think about what you’re wearing and wonder: Has a slave touched your socks? You won’t get an answer.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a tough question.</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t seen the complexity of such a question described better than in the essay “<a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html">I, Pencil</a>“: Leonard Read’s fictional account of the genealogy of a pencil. One line in particular is relevant. And, remember, a pencil is speaking: “Just as you cannot trace your family tree back very far, so is it impossible for me to name and explain all my antecedents.”</p>
<p>You get it. Things we perceive as simple are actually quite complicated. The pencil mentions its lead was mined in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and a paper sack was manufactured and discarded to carry it from place to place. Then it was shipped all around the world before mixing with clay from Mississippi and ammonium hydroxide.</p>
<p>It goes on. Imagine how much more complex a smartphone is. So there’s a good reason that if you ask a given company whether a slave touched your particular pair of socks, the ornaments on your Christmas tree, or even just your chocolate bar, you’ll most likely receive an incomplete answer.</p>
<p>That shouldn’t be, and it doesn’t need to stay that way forever.</p>
<p>Slavery exists today on the other side of a semiporous wall from most consumers. The cheap products that slaves manufacture are efficiently aggregated into global supply chains and transmitted around the world. The invisible mechanism that takes <a href="http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/forced_labour/forced_labour_in_uzbek_cotton_industry/default.aspx">cotton from Uzbekistan</a> to <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/a-struggle-from-dawn-to-dusk/">garment factories in Bangladesh</a> and then overseas and eventually onto your back is called the market.</p>
<p>And the market should have, can have, and must have a baseline ethics that values the dignity of human beings independent of what they can be forced to produce.</p>
<p><strong>Now.</strong></p>
<p>It takes a long time to change the world, but only a moment to make up your mind. It’s not so hard to imagine that if you’ve read this far you are inclined to do something.</p>
<p>But what?</p>
<p>First, think. Do me a favor and leave a comment below. How do you think the investment community can best express a wish not to be complicit in slave labor? How can we speak so that the management teams you work with will listen?</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine. But I’d suggest a simple question will be quite effective: “Can you assert that your supply chain is free of forced labor?”</p>
<p>Ask it in conference calls, one on one, and in annual meetings. And whatever the answer is, if it boils down to “no,” follow up with “When will you be able to prove that assertion?”</p>
<p>The product of stolen labor should not be able to find a market. And if the largest companies do their due diligence to ensure they are not unwittingly enabling this reprehensible trade, it will become harder and harder to make money through slavery.</p>
<p>You can help bring that about with an email. Do you care to?</p>
<p><strong>You Should.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/03/world/mauritania.slaverys.last.stronghold/">Slavery has been outlawed everywhere on earth since 1981</a>. And companies, in general, should know what’s going on in their supply chains for a variety of reasons. But thanks to a few legal developments, it’s clear that it’s past time to get on the right side of history.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted">Modern Slavery Act</a> requires any company that does business in the United Kingdom that has a total turnover of £36 million or more to <a href="http://www.corpcounsel.com/id=1202763929054/Is-Your-Company-Ready-for-the-UK-Modern-Slavery-Act" title="Link: http://www.corpcounsel.com/id=1202763929054/Is-Your-Company-Ready-for-the-UK-Modern-Slavery-Act">report on the steps it has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in “any of its supply chains”</a> as part of its annual reports.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/164934.pdf">A more prescriptive law</a> has been in effect in California since 2012. The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act is applicable to companies that sell in the state and have worldwide turnover of more than $100 million. It mandates stricter compliance, and has an associated <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/sb657/resource-guide.pdf">resource guide</a> that might be shared with your portfolio companies.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but I am an investor. And since it seems possible to avoid a swath of legal and moral issues through straightforward due diligence, I’d take a dim view of any management team that doesn’t think now is the time to act.</p>

<p>It would seem, at least from first examination, that supposedly choice-starved investors are more like New York City sports fans than victims of a famine. As a lifelong Yankees fan, I had fun <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2016_07_09_wasmlb_nynmlb_1#game=2016_07_09_wasmlb_nynmlb_1,game_state=Wrapup">watching the Mets lose</a> this weekend. And though from a certain cynical point of view you could say it wasn’t much of a game, it would be hard to argue that it wasn’t one at all.</p>
<p>The investment industry is full of persuasive, highly analytical people. They want you to see it their way. If it’s Treasury bonds they like, Treasury bonds are it. If it’s consumer stocks, then you’ll hear about it.</p>
<p>The trick is to realize that when someone tells you that there is no other way to play, they are revealing more about themselves than they are about the market. I’m a Yankees fan because I’m from New York City, and my hometown team won the World Series when I was <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws.jsp?feature=club_champs" title="Link: http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws.jsp?feature=club_champs">eight, 10, 11, and 12 years old</a>. Every kid should have that experience. It never goes away.</p>
<p>The markets have favorites in just the same way, but it bears mentioning that a lot of wealth has been created over the past 20 years or so, in a lot of different ways. Have you looked at a <a href="http://finviz.com/futures_charts.ashx?t=ZB&amp;p=m1">monthly chart of the long bond</a> recently? It takes a lot of discipline to find an alternative to that, especially if you’ve been riding the wave the whole way.</p>
<p>So do me a favor . . .</p>
<p>Let’s stop talking about which asset class is preternaturally disposed to turn in phenomenal returns because of some analytical angle you or others came up with. Let’s just discard the question. To get one last breath out of my sports analogy, let’s remember that there are sports played all around the world.</p>
<p>I quoted Miguel Fidalgo of Triarii Capital earlier this week <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/07/13/and-then-what-insights-from-nyssas-benjamin-graham-conference/">saying</a>, “We’re invested in Greece. It’s not the top of the business cycle there.” That laconic optimism has a place in your portfolio. “<a href="https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/are-us-stocks-overvalued">Are US Stocks Overvalued?</a>” I’m not sure. “<a href="http://fat-pitch.blogspot.com/2014/11/are-low-rates-responsible-for-high.html?spref=tw&amp;m=1" title="Link: http://fat-pitch.blogspot.com/2014/11/are-low-rates-responsible-for-high.html?spref=tw&amp;m=1">Are Low Rates Responsible for High Valuations?</a>” Urban says the answer is no, but let’s zoom somewhere else for a minute.</p>

<p>Keep asking the titular question and you’ll stay out of trouble, <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/04/crashing-planes-mungers-system/" title="Link: https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/04/crashing-planes-mungers-system/">says Charlie Munger</a>, a man we would all do well to emulate.</p>
<p>Nearly 125 years after the birth of Ben Graham, the investing profession’s organizing genius, that same question loomed large over a group of practitioners gathered at the <a href="http://www.nyssa.org/">New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA)</a> for <a href="http://www.nyssa.org/events/upcomingevents/conferencesseminars/ctl/viewdetail/mid/3763/itemid/2714/d/20160629.aspx" title="Link: http://www.nyssa.org/events/upcomingevents/conferencesseminars/ctl/viewdetail/mid/3763/itemid/2714/d/20160629.aspx">the Annual Benjamin Graham Conference</a>, during which they considered the future of an activity with a rich past — and an uncertain future.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nyssa.org/Events/AnnualBenjaminGrahamConferenceBios.aspx#cooperman">Leon Cooperman, CFA</a>, formerly of Goldman Sachs and presently of Omega Advisors, set a less-than-promising tone for the day. Noting the rise of passive investing and the reasonably high probability that automation will transform numerous professional fields, investing among them, he <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/leon-cooperman-outlook-on-hedge-fund-industry-174906230.html" title="Link: http://finance.yahoo.com/news/leon-cooperman-outlook-on-hedge-fund-industry-174906230.html">suggested that younger attendees would perhaps be best served by seeking employment in some other industry</a>.</p>
<p>After all, the business of fund management is to deploy capital in search of unusual returns, and the consensus in our world is diminished opportunity.</p>
<p>**There are only so many sources of return.
**
For investors in common equities, they are traditionally considered an expansion in earnings, an expansion of the multiple at which those earnings are valued, or some form of financial engineering that accelerates the delivery of earnings — present or future — to equity holders.</p>
<p>The former two — the organic sorts of growth — are not thought to be forthcoming in the current environment.</p>
<p>In aggregate, the largest US companies <a href="http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-sales-growth">are not growing sales</a>. I can hardly remember a major economic development in recent history that did not cause the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revise its growth outlook downward. Indeed, the IMF <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/imf-sees-negative-repercussions-from-brexit-on-global-growth-2016-06-30">pointed to Brexit</a> this time, but it also revised estimates downwards <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2016/NEW041216A.htm">every</a> quarter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/imf-cuts-global-growth-forecasts">this year</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still good sense to look for reasons why an index might rally further, but be prepared for a profound feeling of ennui. In the absence of organic growth, investors have shifted their appetites towards predictable cash-flow streams. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/general-mills-isnt-appetizing-at-this-price-1467135536">General Mills’ rich valuation</a> is an illuminating case in point. The company trades for more than 20 times its projected earnings in the next year. An optimist might see this as a harbinger of innovative breakfast experiences to come. An analyst is more likely to consider it part of a broader flight to perceived safety.</p>
<p>A bond-like stock might just be tailor-made for this purportedly low-return environment, but those disposed to that school of thought would do well to do more than just read macroeconomic commentary about the implications of such a phenomenon — <a href="https://www.blackrockblog.com/2016/04/18/prepare-for-return-environment/">there</a> <a href="http://astorim.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/astor-2016-outlook-welcome-to-the-low-return-environment.pdf?q=assets/astor-2016-outlook---welcome-to-the-low-return-environment.pdf">is</a> <a href="https://www.abbotdowning.com/_asset/zzgx7l/Navigating-in-a-Low-Return-Environment----FINAL---Low-res.pdf">no</a> <a href="http://www.rocaton.com/files/LowReturn.pdf">shortage</a> <a href="https://next.ft.com/content/695591ce-2f15-11e6-a18d-a96ab29e3c95">of</a> <a href="http://www.pionline.com/article/20160406/ONLINE/160409908/low-return-environment-has-cios-thinking-differently-8212-pension-bridge-conference">analysis</a>. Think: What happens after a low-return environment?</p>
<p>**It goes away.
**
Indeed, when my colleague Roger Urwin gave <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cp.v23.n4.4366">thoughtful and pragmatic guidance</a> on “Asset Allocation in a Low-Return Environment” almost 10 years ago, it would have been difficult for most observers to imagine the rapid shift in sentiment that followed. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/17bear.html?_r=0">JP Morgan bought Bear Stearns for $2 a share</a> just 16 months later, and a low-return environment gave way to a generational buying opportunity.</p>
<p>I am not forecasting a crisis, nor did any of the panelists. But many believe that risks loom within indices apparently priced for perfection.</p>
<p>One signal indication of that came when conference moderator <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/author/michaelweinberg/">Michael Oliver Weinberg, CFA</a>, turned the conversation to the utility sector. He asked “Does anyone feel the growing adoption of solar technology is not an existential threat to these companies?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>And this is not a small matter. Investors in utility companies are in many cases making their allocations under the theory that not much will change, or at least not to an extent to affect demand for the product their assets are developing: electricity.</p>
<p>This is a bad assumption. <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/2016/05/17/amy-myers-jaffe-energy-markets-and-musical-chairs/">We are likely to see material shifts</a> in both the energy demand profile and the way power is generated going forward. It is doubtful utilities will respond in a universally nimble fashion.</p>
<p>**Indices don’t cure idiosyncrasy.
**
This should be obvious to <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/01/27/34-charts-this-time-is-different/">those who remember</a> that last year <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-a-drab-2015-for-investors-four-stocks-made-all-the-difference/2016/01/04/e5259462-b331-11e5-9388-466021d971de_story.html">Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google (FANG) may have contributed more to the return of the S&amp;P 500 index than the other 496 companies combined.</a> But panelist Steven Bregman, CFA, of Horizon Kinetics, took it a step further. He sees more than just “no values in the sector funds,” but idiosyncratic risk as well.</p>
<p>It would be foolish to forget that some sector funds are really quite concentrated in just a few companies. The utility sector exchange-traded fund (ETF) has <a href="http://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlu/holdings">more than 25% of its portfolio</a> in its top three holdings, as of this writing. The energy sector ETF <a href="http://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xle/holdings">has almost 34% in its top two</a>.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there is a famine of opportunity. Far from it.</p>
<p>Against this dour macro commentary, Miguel Fidalgo of Triarii Capital was quick to point out that the world doesn’t move in macro lockstep: “We’re invested in Greece . . . it’s not the top of the business cycle over there.” This was perhaps the understatement of the day, but it made the useful point that we are poorly served by letting dour headlines become the full story. Indeed, there are certain to be individual cash-flow streams that grow no matter what happens. That’s why <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/06/29/post-brexit-tools-to-reset-your-narrative/">staying positive and driven</a> is so critical to our long-term success as investors.</p>
<p>But though individual names and income streams may grow, the way we invest has gotten a little bit weird. <em>The Economist</em> <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21700401-vanguard-has-radically-changed-money-management-being-boring-and-cheap-index-we">recently profiled the amazing rise of Vanguard</a>, which in general has been a massive boon to investors, including myself. Few question Vanguard’s motives, but it may be time to wonder about the long-term implications of the investment philosophy it has long championed.</p>
<p>Bregman noted an “ETF Vortex” that, in his view, is distorting the clearing prices of almost all large assets around the world. An index can create a self-reinforcing notion of value, so this makes some sense.</p>
<p>**It should also create opportunity.
**
Whatever distortion ETFs, indices, the US Federal Reserve, or anything else is creating in asset prices, it’s worth remembering that markets work in an altogether better fashion today than they did in Ben Graham’s time. <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/03/05/the-reasons-we-honor-irving-kahn-cfa/" title="Link: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/03/05/the-reasons-we-honor-irving-kahn-cfa/">The notion that we could use accounting information to make a decision about which companies to invest in was once controversial</a>. The job title “investment analyst” has not existed for that long.</p>
<p>In a sense, it is remarkable progress just that we have a forum for these conversations. But we shouldn’t take too much comfort from that. A forum is only as good as the curiosity that it feeds, and so a big part of me is glad that so many thoughtful practitioners joined us to ask — in one way or another — and then what?</p>
<p>I hope you’ll join us next time.</p>

<p>_I wrote this post for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.
_</p>
<p>Things happen.</p>
<p>You expect some of them, not all. And indeed clients are served in our industry through acts of judgment and discipline amid uncertainty, not just miracles of prophecy.</p>
<p>I am going to wager that you, or at least someone at your firm, was in the office this past weekend. The <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/06/25/the-brexit-results-what-happened-whats-next/">United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (EU)</a>. There will be other agitations and indeed other elections along the same lines in the months and years to come.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, I suggest you take a look at <em><a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/rf/Pages/rf.v2015.n1.1.aspx">Geopolitics for Investors</a></em>, a recent publication of the CFA Institute Research Foundation and authored by Pippa Malmgren, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and an advocate for Brexit.</p>
<p>An invitation to consider the thought processes of a reputable person who is cheering the Brexit should be interesting regardless of your level of pre-existing knowledge. It’s always neat to look at the radar of someone who thinks differently than you. And Malmgren thinks differently than many of us, if recent market behavior is any indication.</p>
<p>But to navigate the changing contours of the world productively, you’ll need to do more than just peek over someone’s shoulder. Successful active managers create their own context on a continuous basis. They take facts, relate them to possible futures, and construct rigorous understandings that are robust enough to survive surprise developments. The combination of analytical rigor and imagination produces an edge.</p>
<p><strong>Assuming You Add Effort</strong></p>
<p>To put it mildly, there is nothing easy about developing a valuable viewpoint. It is the strong form of a hard thing: You won’t know if you have succeeded for a long time, and it takes tremendous judgment to even choose how you spend your day.</p>
<p>We have done some things that we hope will make it easier for you though, and the purpose of this post is to summarize and present them in a practical form.</p>
<p>The first and most holistically useful is the <em><a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/books/Pages/investment_idea_generation_guide.aspx?intCamp=%24topic61">Investment Idea Generation Guide</a></em> that Jason Voss, CFA, and I authored late last year. It is meant to be helpful in general, but you may find it to be of particular value if you were caught by surprise last week.</p>
<p>Jason introduced me to a technique called scenario planning, which is a little bit different than you might expect on first look. It has more in common with a vision quest than a financial model that combines base, aggressive, and adverse cases to derive an expectation of value.</p>
<p><strong>Be Ready to Get Weird</strong></p>
<p>The goal of investment research is to produce a viewpoint that is fundamentally different from what others believe and yet is still correct. <a href="https://annual.cfainstitute.org/2016/05/13/think-different-but-be-right/">Think different, but be right</a>, in other words. The challenge we collectively face is not how to organically reach the same conclusion as others, but how to stick out in useful and forward-looking ways.</p>
<p>We don’t live in a world that is short on risks, so it will pay to get ahead of the curve a little bit here. The World Economic Forum’s <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/Media/TheGlobalRisksReport2016.pdf">2016 risks report</a> may be valuable at a time like this. As you read it, consider which of the issues it raises you haven’t thought about in a week, a month, or more. Study those.</p>
<p><strong>But Stay Focused, Rational, and Upbeat</strong></p>
<p>There is a deep tragedy to some outcomes that we are forced by fiduciary duty to contemplate.</p>
<p>If you are doing your scenario planning correctly, you will consider things like the possibility of all-out war in Europe, sectarian violence that scales globally, and weaponized diseases.</p>
<p>You will also do well to remember that, in general, the world is a good place to live. There are few alternatives. <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2013/03/elon-musk-die-mars" title="Link: http://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2013/03/elon-musk-die-mars">Elon Musk has said that he’d like to die on Mars</a>, but he might need a little something more <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-22/musk-says-solarcity-deal-about-synergy-but-it-may-be-about-debt">in the way of cash flow</a> to get there. When economic winds change, some dreams are blown away.</p>
<p>But the long-term trends that form the basis of a broadly improving human condition are still intact. Whatever happens in politics, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/" title="Link: https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">life expectancy is up sharply</a>. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/crispr-dna-editing-2/">We can now edit DNA</a>, which promises to remake the fabric of the human condition. There is never a bad time to start an innovative business. Macro trends have no bearing on entrepreneurial ambition.</p>
<p>However bad you think a given development is, it is worth remembering that the productive step is to put your focus in a positive place. Real businesses were built during the Great Depression. People made money during the financial crisis. Despite myriad predictions to the contrary, the sun still rises every day in the east.</p>
<p>This thing, whatever it is, will be fine in the long term. Don’t let it keep you from hunting for opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="economic-thinking-thats-ready-for-retirement"><a class="toclink" href="../../2016/05/26/economic-thinking-thats-ready-for-retirement/">Economic Thinking That's Ready for Retirement</a></h2>
<p>If I win, you lose.</p>
<p>It’s an insight that anybody who’s spent time on a playground has had at some point or another. And for a broad spectrum of human activity, it’s completely correct. Most games have winners and losers. And usually, wanting to win promotes good behavior.</p>
<p>I’ve been both a player and a coach, and I have never found a better approach than <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/building-better-athletes-with-more-sleep/382019/">getting enough sleep</a>, <a href="http://www.olympic.org/documents/reports/en/en_report_833.pdf">eating right</a>, and showing up ready to work hard. If you’re having fun, the rest is detail. And healthy competition tends to encourage exactly this sort of good behavior.</p>
<p>But there is only so much you can learn from the playground, and unfortunately, there is an all-too-common tendency to apply schoolyard logic in places where it has no bearing, such as international trade.</p>
<p>So, I was glad to see that when we asked <em>CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</em> readers which of four economic ideas is most ready for retirement, a plurality (42%) of 675 respondents chose the notion that one country’s growth is another country’s lost opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>That is not how things work.</strong></p>
<p>For one, considering economic trends in the context of countries winning and losing is about as cutting-edge as mercantilism, which institutionalized such analysis.</p>
<p>As the fall in oil prices reminded us over the past two years, sometimes it really is the case that nobody is in control. Winds blow, and some countries are better placed to harness them than others. Indeed, too much focus on winning can cause the analyst to believe a sovereign is at its strongest <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/twilight-the-petrostate-16235">just as the weather shifts</a>.</p>
<p>It can also give rise to protectionism, a force today’s leaders seem unable to resist despite repeated (and increasingly humiliating) protestations to the contrary. Following a November 2008 G–20 summit in Washington, D.C., world leaders released a <a href="http://www.cfr.org/financial-crises/statement-g-20-summit-november-2008/p17778">statement</a> underscoring “the critical importance of rejecting protectionism and not turning inward in times of financial uncertainty.”</p>
<p>This was reiterated again by the same group in 2009, with a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2009/pdf/g20_040209.pdf">communique</a> that read, “We will not repeat the historic mistakes of protectionism of previous eras”.</p>
<p>That sentiment lasted for about a minute. A 2012 report titled “<a href="http://www.globaltradealert.org/11th_GTA_report">Débâcle</a>,” by <a href="http://www.globaltradealert.org/">Global Trade Alert</a>, provides a good summary of how what was done differed from what was said.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert: It did, a lot.</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/549028/EXPO_STU(2015)549028_EN.pdf">2015 report</a> for the European parliament’s think tank, authors Roberta Barone and Roberto Bendini laid to rest any hope that world leaders had actually stayed true to their word, writing: “Unfortunately, this pledge to refrain from adopting new trade-restrictive measures — and to roll-back those in place — has not been honored. For the sixth year, the global institutions monitoring protectionism in the G–20 have confirmed the accumulation of new trade-restrictions and few efforts to liberalise trade.”</p>
<p>Now stop for a second and think. How did the preceding couple of paragraphs read to you: like good news? Bad? You’re wrong in either case. In particular if you’re a die-hard free-trader, I would encourage you to examine <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w21906">what happens to labor markets as business adapts</a> to the sorts of sudden trade shocks that come from low-priced foreign competition.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that a good long-term plan to nurture a domestic industry might involve some tariffs or trade restrictions at some point. The excellent (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silent-War-Business-Battles-Americas/dp/0679728279/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464203058&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=silent+war+business">and now basically free</a>) book <em>The Silent War: Inside the Global Business Battles Shaping America’s Future</em> details some cases in which governments have deployed restrictive policies to develop the groundwork for future economic miracles.</p>

<p><strong>Which economic idea is most ready for retirement?</strong>
<img alt="Which economic idea is most ready for retirement" src="images/Which-economic-idea-is-most-ready-for-retirement.png?resize=640%2C335"/></p>
<hr/>
<p>The second-place finisher in our poll, with 28% of the vote, was the premise that free market competition always creates positive outcomes. I’ve got a little statue of a bull on my desk right next to my nameplate, and am generally inclined to be in favor of markets  — but they can be shortsighted sometimes. Some current examples of objectionable activity we can thank free market competition for: <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/e-cigarette-ads-target-millions-kids-cdc-says-n490601">marketing e-cigarettes to children</a>, <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-05-peru-declares-mercury-poison-emergency.html">unregulated gold mines dumping mercury into Amazon rivers</a>, and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/babyview-ultrasound-clinic-pickering-provincial-regulation-1.3589897" title="Link: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/babyview-ultrasound-clinic-pickering-provincial-regulation-1.3589897">ultrasound clinics in Ontario that show you stock photos instead of your baby</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these each seem like open-and-shut cases where regulatory attention is warranted. But it’s important to remember that something is lost every time something is regulated, and it’s deeply tricky to effectively police what should not be done without stamping out activity that could have been productive. I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to suggest that a child could needlessly die because these fly-by-night ultrasound clinics prevented parents from recognizing that a pregnancy is in trouble. And their presence erodes trust in generally hardworking medical professionals. But it’s not trivial to eliminate them (or any of these other practices) without creating bottlenecks. Unfortunately, “prudent regulation” does not have the curb appeal of “free markets.”</p>
<p><strong>Emergent themes.</strong></p>
<p>The last two responses nearly split the balance of the vote, with the premise that individuals need paid employment to contribute to society receiving 15% and the thought that GDP is the best measure of a country’s economic activity getting 15%.</p>
<p>This makes sense: they are quite related. Both augur in one way or another for some means of evaluating activity that is not denominated in currency. The shortcomings of GDP are documented well enough that the European Commission has a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/key_quotes_en.html" title="Link: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/key_quotes_en.html">page dedicated to quotes enumerating them</a> as part of their “<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/index_en.html">Beyond GDP</a>” initiative.</p>
<p>It also may surprise you to note that it’s not a measure as deeply baked into history as, say, profitability or revenue. <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=GDP&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2CGDP%3B%2Cc0">A quick search of published books</a> shows that GDP experienced a sharp upswing in usage during the 1990s, rather than the sustained level of interest that you might expect.</p>
<p>The premise that we should detach a job from the notion of one’s economic value is also gaining significant steam, with interest in a so-called “basic income” even reaching <a href="https://www.janus.com/bill-gross-investment-outlook" title="Link: https://www.janus.com/bill-gross-investment-outlook">Bill Gross’s latest investment outlook</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/wiki/index" title="Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/wiki/index">Here</a> is a great summary of what that entails.</p>
