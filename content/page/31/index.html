<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Deflation is a thing now.</p>
<p>At least for the moment, it’s a statistical truth in some places — <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/hicp/html/inflation.en.html">I’m looking at you, eurozone</a>. But what does that mean? What’s causing it? And most importantly if you’re an investor, what the heck do you do about it?</p>
<p>Let’s find out. And be advised: if you’re not particularly concerned about deflation, you should probably get your head examined. Though you might have more fun checking out <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/01/14/the-blueprints-of-alpha-29-charts-29-comments-and-the-new-hotness/">the other charts post</a> I wrote recently.</p>
<p>The warning that I published in that article applies triply to these charts: They are just pretty pictures! If you read this and then use it to make investment decisions without verifying its content, you’ll literally <a href="http://imgur.com/UusInir">wipe the smile right off of my face</a>.</p>
<p><strong>And as usual, if you dig this sort of stuff (and promise to think for yourself),</strong> <a href="http://srvo.org/enter-the-sloane-zone"><strong>you should subscribe to my newsletter</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.10.48_PM.png"/></p>
<p>In case you were wondering if it was just you (or really just me) who’s thinking about deflation, you’re incorrect. Google search volume for “deflation” is rising to levels not seen since 2009.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.10.54_PM.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.10.54_PM.png"/></p>
<p>And the regional breakout is interesting too. Austrians are second after Nigerians . . .</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.11.01_PM.png"/></p>
<p>. . . but empirically are the least deflated members of the European Union. I noted <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/01/14/the-blueprints-of-alpha-29-charts-29-comments-and-the-new-hotness/">last time</a> that they were attracting a crazy share of immigration inside the eurozone, so it might be worth digging in a bit more. Anyone want to grab a drink in Vienna?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.12.11_PM.png"/></p>
<p>The picture of the aggregate doesn’t look good at all though.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/fastest_growing_new_asset_class_in_the_world.jpg"/></p>
<p>And the growth in negative-yielding government debt is clearly alarming, though it’s important to remember that a negative stated yield and an investor return are not the same thing. In a deflationary environment, money gets more valuable. Getting €.99 back in a year on your investment of €1.00 might be a pretty good deal if those €.99 can buy a whole lot of stuff all of a sudden.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.12.18_PM.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.12.18_PM.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.12.18_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Let’s zoom out a bit and think about what deflation really is. I find this 800-year chart of the Swedish consumer price index (CPI) oddly comforting when I remember that humans actually managed to live through the multicentury period of pronounced inflation and deflation that is pictured here. That said, it does highlight that we live in an unusual era of monetary peace. The <a href="http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/01/eu-deflation-good-or-bad/">article</a> that this tweet links to also includes a great chart relating the US CPI to stock performance (spoiler: no relation) as well as the excellent observation that while the world was on the gold standard, deflation had to follow inflation: you couldn’t change the monetary base at will!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/disappointed_across_sectors.jpg"/></p>
<p>Still, it does look like we Americans may be joining our colleagues in Europe sooner than we’d like. A whole host of US economic data has disappointed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_5.12.23_PM.png"/></p>
<p>And this time series of the CPI doesn’t look cheery, although it’s worth noting that it managed to correct back in 2011, and the Europeans are talking about a “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ecb-benoit-coeure-qe-has-to-be-big-2015-1">big</a>” round of quantitative easing (QE).</p>
<p>That’s not the only thing we need to think about though. The US dollar has rallied massively and oil is getting crushed. Are we really surprised by an environment where individuals are paying less for things?</p>
<p>It is also somewhat typical for us to go through a period when initially rosy estimates are rolled back. We literally do it every year, since forecasts are really just a way of having a conversation about expectations and it’s natural to be optimistic.</p>
<p>There has definitely been an impact on the earnings guidance that firms have been issuing though. It’s possible that this is reflective of investor relations teams’ tendency to seek lower expectations that are easier to exceed, but the zero line in this time series is clearly related to recessions.</p>
<p>Just like this one.</p>
<p>So what do you do? It depends, but it’s worth remembering that things still have a tendency to grow over long time horizons, despite disastrous events and unbelievable volatility.</p>
<p>The trick for enterprising investors will be to stay focused on what’s really important. In life, that means being a positive influence on yourself and those around you. In investing (whether the outlay is your dollars or your time), that means focusing on what you’ll get back later from what you part with, and what you’ll be able to do with that. In a deflationary environment, money increases in value automatically, which stalls investment and defers consumption.</p>
<p>What’s the best trade you can put on in your personal account to ensure your financial success in such an environment? <a href="http://srvo.org/have-you-made-a-profit-on-your-life">Make sure you're making a profit on your life</a>. It looks like money will only get more valuable.</p>

<h2 id="29-charts-worth-your-time"><a class="toclink" href="../../2015/01/14/29-charts-worth-your-time/">29 Charts Worth Your Time</a></h2>
<p><em>This is one of my favorite posts ever. It was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>I've collected 29 charts over the last several days that I think are worth your attention. But before you skim them you should really read the next three paragraphs.</p>
<p>There are some major analytical errors that you can make if you use charts the wrong way. Seriously. For one, it's always necessary to actually source the data yourself. These are images on the Internet, and so even though I think they're credible and want to believe they're true, you have to be an enterprising investor and verify them yourself. After all, I want to believe <a href="http://loyalkng.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/star-wars-band-kiss-princess-leia-hon-solo-r2d2-c3po-darth-vader-luke-skywalker-.png">this image</a> is real, too.</p>
<p>So you should look at these charts, think about and corroborate them, but you should also study the excellent work my colleague Jason Voss, CFA, has done highlighting the subtleties of analyzing charts well. His <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/05/15/an-r-squared-chart-taxonomy-seeing-is-not-believing/" title="Link: http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/05/15/an-r-squared-chart-taxonomy-seeing-is-not-believing/">r-squared chart taxonomy</a> would be required reading if I ran the world.</p>
<p>Anyway, we're coming to the end of the previously specified three paragraphs of text, so I will suggest you <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/follow-the-enterprising-investor/" title="Link: http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/follow-the-enterprising-investor/">subscribe to the Enterprising Investor</a> if you like this sort of thing.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.08_PM.png"/></p>
<p>One of the things that's intriguing about this chart is the repeat appearances on it. I sometimes hear from market participants that a country or issuer wouldn't default/devalue because then markets "would never" lend to them or trust their currency again. Oh really? Seems a lot more like the markets have pretty short memories.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.13_PM.png"/></p>
<p>This one is remarkable because it shows that central banks have been printing money more or less in a straight line since since even before the financial crisis is officially demarcated. I don't think anybody has argued seriously that they are printing money only to address the financial crisis — there is a broader economic malaise it caused as well — but it's noteworthy both how constant the growth is and how small a trillion dollars looks on this chart.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.19_PM.png"/></p>
<p>One of my favorite mental models comes from the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/todd_harrison">Todd Harrison</a>, who coined the phrase "the path of maximum frustration." An unexpectedly cold Arctic winter which leads to the expansion of the polar ice caps at an unusually fast clip seems like exactly that, since climate scientists must convince a scientifically illiterate population that action is needed to put the breaks on climate change. This data point may make an appearance in domestic political conversations in the coming year as environmental legislation is debated again.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.26_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Almost as compelling as the stated point of this chart — asset bubbles, indeed, are difficult to identify — is the transformation that's taken place in the S&amp;P 500 over the last 40 years. If I had made this chart, I might have titled it "The Amazing Disappearing Telecom, Materials, and Utilities Industries." Watching them vanish from large cap indices is a provocative look at how domestic markets have evolved.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.33_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Any change in a long-term trend is worth paying attention to, and here we have a particularly important one. Almost exactly 10 years ago, the housing industry was so hot that it seemed like an engine for obvious, permanent wealth creation. It's interesting that the vacancy rate has been flat for so long. Is it really possible that household balance sheets are healthy enough that people are choosing to buy instead of rent? I hope so.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.38_PM.png"/></p>
<p>The $8-trillion figure given in this study is a specific number attached to a forecast, and as such is guaranteed to be wrong, but it's important to note our susceptibility to the decline in effectiveness of our antibiotics. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/01/07/new-class-of-antibiotic-found-in-dirt-could-prove-resistant-to-resistance/">A new drug has just been uncovered that has a lot of promise</a>, but it's always worth remembering that we're in an arms race with evolution.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.44_PM.png"/></p>
<p>After years of flat-screen televisions being the epitome of cool, it's kind of wonderful that curved screens are the new hot thing . . . at least according to the television manufacturers trying desperately to upsell us on them. To me, it seems like it's getting cheaper and more competitive to produce television screens that are larger and better than ever before. I have a seven-year-old HDTV that cost more than $1500 but could be replaced for $399. It seems like low-end televisions are awesome enough that most consumers are wondering why they would ever shell out money for the new hotness, unless they like setting money on fire . . .</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.50_PM.png"/></p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.jpmorganfunds.com/cm/Satellite?UserFriendlyURL=diguidetomarkets&amp;pagename=jpmfVanityWrapper&amp;vanity=diguidetomarkets&amp;Source=Guide_to_the_Markets#top">JP Morgan Guide to the Markets</a> is out, and it's worth a read. I should have said "since mid 2009" in my tweet above, but it's remarkable how consistently S&amp;P 500 companies have favored buybacks over dividends. It's also remarkable that companies are now returning ~$176 billion to shareholders per quarter, versus ~$140 billion in 2007–2008. Measured from there, it's a pathetic compound growth rate. Measured from the next year — when it grew from ~$80 billion — it's amazing.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.46.58_PM.png"/></p>
<p>It looks like banks have been wary of real estate loans ever since almost being ruined by them during the financial crisis. Maybe that ends now? It's a bit worrisome that commercial and industrial loans have been so far above the median for so long, and real estate loans are only just catching up. Does this speak more to changing risk appetites on the lending side or changes in the demand equation for housing?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.47.07_PM.png"/></p>
<p>It’s not my job to make stock picks, but rather to filter the world’s investment information and provide helpful perspective. Last year, I published a series of conversations I had with prominent investors in India, and one of them <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/12/04/special-report-is-corporate-india-healthy/">cautioned that one of the more significant mistakes foreign investors make in allocating to India is buying into mega-cap names</a> . . . like those in the SENSEX. Enterprising investors who believe the bullish argument on India are likely best served investigating the names that aren’t as widely followed. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.47.17_PM.png"/></p>
<p>This chart speaks for itself. Software is a real thing, and we need to stop pretending software companies are just a bunch of kids in hoodies.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.47.23_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Our New York City office is about two blocks from the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, otherwise known as the Mecca of selfies. I have had the distinct pleasure of observing couple after couple taking their picture in front of the tree with a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2015/jan/11/meet-the-man-who-invented-the-selfie-stick">selfie stick</a>, and I have to say there’s something endearing about it . . . even if it’s intrinsically ridiculous. The selfie stick serves as a reminder that it is just as difficult to predict the values underlying technological progress as its course and application. I hope this is just a fad (because . . . come on), but I can’t really get that bent out of shape about something that makes it easier for people to commemorate moments together.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.47.29_PM.png"/></p>
<p>My understanding of the oil and gas business is that “typical” wells are about as easy to find as “normal market conditions.” But that said, wells that have been fracked experience a substantial drop-off in production that isn’t talked about enough. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.47.35_PM.png"/></p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that although these rigs decline in production over time, we have also been getting better at extraction. Those declines may come from a higher base. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.54.13_PM.png"/></p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that a lot of people talk about commodities — and particularly oil prices — as trading very cyclically. We can only learn a limited amount by comparing such a long time series to the present — oil markets before the invention of the telephone bear little resemblance to those of today in terms of supply, demand, or even location — but the chart is provocative, as Callum observes. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.47.44_PM.png"/></p>
<p>There will almost certainly be a time in my investment career when Africa is hailed as the engine of global growth. Will that era begin this year? </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.47.55_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Our members certainly aren’t all that bullish on South Africa, France, and Brazil.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.00_PM.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.00_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Last year they were pretty bullish on the world economy though. If I were you, I’d read this year’s <a href="http://www.cfainstitute.org/about/research/surveys/Pages/global_market_sentiment_survey.aspx">Global Market Sentiment Survey</a>. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.06_PM.png"/></p>
<p>If you read it last year, you probably would have noticed a decent shift in sentiment about Japan. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.14_PM.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.14_PM.png"/></p>
<p>And the significant concerns about a real estate bubble among members in the Asia-Pacific region. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.19_PM.png"/></p>
<p>I’m consistently amazed at people’s willingness to confuse bitcoin the technology with bitcoin the asset. The technology and its core innovations — lower authentication fees, peer-to-peer transactions, and so on — are amazing, but the asset itself is confusing to value and not necessarily tied to the adoption of the technology. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.35_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Following up on the preceding chart, can you believe that bitcoin performed even worse than the Russian ruble in 2014? </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.42_PM.png"/></p>
<p>And it’s worth remembering what the long-term trend in the US dollar looks like as we close out a year in which the US Dollar Index has rallied in almost a straight line since mid-summer. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.48.48_PM.png"/></p>
<p>This is a gorgeous piece of analysis. It might be natural to think that the Russian market would be categorically “cheap” right now, especially considering the troubles they’ve had recently. If you factor in the market’s assessment of the credit risk, not so much. Turkey jumps off the page as being worth consideration here, but if this chart serves any purpose it is as a reminder that any one factor is never dispositive in investment research. Enterprising investors should always look for harmony in a series of statistics, sensations, and sentiments, rather than a “smoking gun” number.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.49.00_PM.png"/></p>
<p>I was in Times Square last Thursday night to see a show and had planned on meeting friends at Shake Shack for a burger and a beer beforehand. I was shocked to find there was a line outside the door in sub-freezing temperatures. Humorously, across the street there was an empty McDonald’s with hundreds of unwanted Big Mac coupons littering the ground outside. It’s tough to imagine a more succinct encapsulation of the relative demand for the two restaurants.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.49.08_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Trade flows are important to analyze, but how often do you look at information flows? This chart highlights the regional power of South Africa and Nigeria, as well as the impressive regional dominance of China. Seen this way, India seems like an international power but not a regional one, and the United Arab Emirates may have just barely eclipsed Saudi Arabia in regional influence.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Screen_Shot_2018-09-02_at_4.49.22_PM.png"/></p>
<p>Austria is attracting an impressive proportion of skilled immigrants, which surprised me. It’s also interesting to note the relative levels of brain drain among the PIIGS countries — Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain — which have long been considered the chief exporters of economic woes to their co-members of the European Union. Ireland seems to be attracting far more skilled laborers than one might expect for an economic basket case.</p>

<h2 id="invest-in-a-potato-before-these-four-things"><a class="toclink" href="../../2014/12/23/invest-in-a-potato-before-these-four-things/">Invest In A Potato Before These Four Things</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>I’m just going to come out and say it: Some of the stuff that Wall Street does is markedly less useful than a potato if you’d like to generate serious investment returns. I’ve done some work and found four investments that are commonly used despite being markedly less useful than the noble spud.</p>
<p>Before we get into my list, let’s consider the merits of the versatile potato, which <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0567e/T0567E0d.htm">actually is the least energy dense of the major staple foods</a>, trailing corn/maize and brown rice by a factor greater than five. In fact, the only area where potatoes lead other staple foods is in water content, where they, of course, lose out in utility to a glass of water. That said, they never waste your time and are only mildly poisonous, and at wholesale prices that can be <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/fvdidnop.pdf" title="Link: http://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/fvdidnop.pdf">as low as $20 for a 50 pound sack</a>, they are arguably reasonably priced. There are also <a href="http://www.foodhealthinnovation.com/media/6418/potato_review_.pdf">many reasons to love them</a> apart from how good they taste when fried.</p>
<p>Despite arguments in their favor, potatoes are illiquid, prone to going rotten, and infrequently used as investments by professionals. Though investment vehicles often come with well-designed tear sheets or prestigious packaging, one or more of these three characteristics apply to more of them than you might think.</p>
<p><strong>The Questionable List</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Levered ETFs:</strong> Leverage is alluring. It amplifies gains and (as is often forgotten) losses, but critiquing levered ETFs is different from critiquing the use of leverage. If these securities only provided leverage, I would say that they’re probably not intended for amateurs but are not intrinsically bad for long-term investors. That is not the case. While they often succeed in matching the returns of the indices they are trying to track on a daily basis, the constant leverage they employ means that they cannot provide tidily leveraged returns. Research <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/dig.v39.n1.4" title="Link: http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/dig.v39.n1.4">summarized in CFA Digest</a>suggests that the most likely long-term outcome for a levered ETF position is about 1.4 times the return with about twice the risk (as measured by standard deviation).</li>
<li><strong>High-Cost Variable Annuities:</strong> Nobody likes paying taxes, least of all me. Variable annuities offer investors the opportunity to put away money tax free and invest it in various securities, often deferring taxes until the money is withdrawn. I should love this, right? There’s only one problem: Most American investors could access that benefit essentially for free with an IRA or 401(k) account. So why would anyone ever buy a variable annuity? Well, they carry hefty commissions, which may lead salespeople looking out for their own interests to push them wherever they can. If you’ve truly maxed out all of your tax deferral options, it may be worth considering a variable annuity, but it’s doubtful the fancy one that the Brylcreemed salesperson is talking to you about is the right one for you. While we were doing the research for this <a href="http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/investor/Documents/variable_annuities.pdf" title="Link: http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/investor/Documents/variable_annuities.pdf">primer on variable annuities</a>, I found that there were almost always low-cost options available. I also found that a good way to see if something was expensive was to count the number of adjectives in its title. If it’s described as “premier,” “executive,” “accelerated,” or anything similar, there’s an excellent chance you can find a lower cost option.</li>
<li><strong>Stocks You Hear about in E-Mail Spam:</strong> It surprises me that anyone buys anything based on e-mail spam, but the <a href="http://www.davidreiley.com/papers/SpamEconomics.pdf" title="Link: http://www.davidreiley.com/papers/SpamEconomics.pdf">economics of e-mail spam</a> suggest that some people do. I and most professional investors would not buy a stock just because we got a research note from Goldman Sachs — even if it was hand delivered by <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/who-we-are/leadership/executive-officers/lloyd-c-blankfein.html">Lloyd Blankfein</a> — so why would you outsource your judgment to some random guy on the Internet? The tippers often suggest that they have knowledge a company is likely to introduce a new and revolutionary product, but in truth that’s most likely either insider trading or a lie. Often these spammers have large blocks of stock they are looking to unload onto unwitting suckers, and if you buy their story that sucker is you. You never want to buy anything you don’t understand, especially if the person telling you to buy it is a stranger on the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Traded REITs:</strong> In order to realize a return, you need to be able to perform a couple of important steps. The first is buying something at a price that it will likely go up from, but the second is perhaps more important: selling it for more than you paid. Investing in something where the latter portion of the process is imperiled is a bad idea unless the potential returns are so significant that they justify the risks . . . and you are truly qualified to evaluate those risks. Non-traded REITs, which are by definition illiquid and <a href="http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140619/FREE/140619903/are-nontraded-reit-commissions-headed-for-a-fall" title="Link: http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140619/FREE/140619903/are-nontraded-reit-commissions-headed-for-a-fall">have charged commissions higher than 10% in some cases</a>, have somehow <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/nontraded-reits-offer-high-returns-but-critics-cite-fees-and-illiquidity-1402670753" title="Link: http://www.wsj.com/articles/nontraded-reits-offer-high-returns-but-critics-cite-fees-and-illiquidity-1402670753">managed to attract the love of their investor base</a>. The arguments in favor of these vehicles often rest on the premise that because they don’t trade often, they are less risky. This is a facade. True risk is best thought of as the likelihood you will lose your money, not a statistical concept. Since commissions on these are so high, there is a certain loss embedded in the product, and it’s not like there are no alternatives. There are plenty of <a href="http://www.dividendyieldhunter.com/real-estate-investment-trusts-reits-sorted-alphabetically">lists available online</a> of <a href="https://www.reit.com/investing/investing-tools/reit-directory/reits-by-ticker-symbol">publicly traded REIT</a>s, so I’m confident you can find a fund that suits your needs without paying a large upfront commission.</li>
</ul>
<p>How’d I do? Do you think I’m being unfair to illiquid REITs? Too laudatory of potatoes? Leave a comment and I promise that in honor of a belated <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nationalmailapotatoday/info?tab=page_info" title="Link: https://www.facebook.com/Nationalmailapotatoday/info?tab=page_info">National Mail a Potato Day on 18 December</a>, I will personally mail you a potato if you post in defense of any of these investments in the comments section. Make sure you also include your mailing address!</p>

<h2 id="grumpy-cat-means-business"><a class="toclink" href="../../2014/12/09/grumpy-cat-means-business/">Grumpy Cat Means Business</a></h2>
<p>The Internet is a funny place. It was reported that <a href="http://www.grumpycats.com/">Grumpy Cat</a> (also known as Tardar Sauce), a somewhat adorable feline famous for looking, well, grumpy, earned <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/544409/Grumpy-Cat-worth-more-than-Hollywood-stars">about $100 million in the last two years or so</a>. That specific number <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/08/grumpy-cat-100-million_n_6288502.html?1418056070">may not be accurate</a>, but Grumpy Cat’s owner is nonetheless generating a pretty decent income.</p>
<p>And it hasn’t come from running a hedge fund on the side. That income comes from the sale of branded merchandise, sponsorships, and other revenue streams associated with the Grumpy Cat brand.</p>
<p>For investment analysts this provides an opportunity to think about value creation in a new light. After all, this is not a start-up that raised a lot of money to create Grumpy Cat memes with a PowerPoint deck and dreams of future profitability. This is cash flow. In CFA Institute circles, that sounds like a real business — even if it doesn’t necessarily look like one.</p>
<p><strong>A Grumpy New World</strong></p>
<p>There have long been significant returns on novelty in the entertainment business. The <a href="http://www.marx-brothers.org/">Marx Brothers</a> traded in similar irreverence. But the prominence of Internet culture (and its inbuilt distribution) is on the upswing. It turns out that Grumpy Cat is represented by <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/25/ben-lashes-meme-manager-for-internet-celebrities.html">Ben Lashes</a>, who <a href="http://aweirdmovie.com/#clients">also represents</a> feline phenomena like <a href="http://keyboardcat.com/">Keyboard Cat</a>and Nyan Cat.</p>
<p>This is a big business because people want to spend time with these pop culture artifacts. <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=grumpy%20cat%2C%20Oakland%20Raiders&amp;cmpt=q" title="Link: http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=grumpy%20cat%2C%20Oakland%20Raiders&amp;cmpt=q">“Grumpy Cat” has been searched for more often than the Oakland Raiders since November 2012</a>, and we have no trouble recognizing an NFL franchise as valuable.</p>
<p>Google searches are a “pull” gesture, and a powerful indicator of user interest. This has not been a good season for the Raiders, but they still have participated in more than two dozen widely televised events and been the subject of much discussion in sports media. If Grumpy Cat ranks on par with them, we as investors need to realize something big.</p>
<p><strong>Minutes of Time Are Valuable</strong></p>
<p>This is what advertisers sell. Any firm in the business of “spreading the word” about things is fundamentally a market maker in customer attention spans — and that includes both technology giants like Google and traditional PR/advertising firms like Omnicom.</p>
<p>Though I’m not one to argue that social media companies are fairly valued or necessarily sound investments, I am frustrated that it’s not immediately apparent to many analysts that media businesses have two key goals, the second of which is contingent on the first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate interest</li>
<li>Generate money</li>
</ol>
<p>I have heard a number of comments expressing skepticism that “new media” companies like <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/" title="Link: http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a> will turn into established, profitable brands, but it doesn’t pay to ignore the value of entertainers with large audiences just because they come in different shapes than we’re used to seeing.</p>

<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor.</em> </p>
<p>This is a bit of a different take on Weekend Reads, as I am filling in for the excellent Dave Larrabee, CFA, and thought I would take the opportunity to share some of the papers I find valuable. I have long maintained an “interesting articles” Dropbox folder where I place the best and most timeless pieces I’ve ever read. Whenever somebody I don’t see often asks me to send along anything interesting I’ve come across, I share that folder with them.</p>
<p>As you might guess, this is a mediocre way to share knowledge. For one thing, a whole bunch of PDFs doesn’t necessarily lend itself to easy perusal. For another, a gigantic block of PDFs is rather inscrutable. Why is there an article about <a href="http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A737424&amp;dswid=4389">soybeans in Uruguay</a> next to my folder on systematic trading? My only answer until now has been, “Why do you think?”</p>
<p>So this post is intended to make amends. Reading any of the pieces below is guaranteed* to make you smarter, better looking, and vastly wealthier. With two exceptions, they are also likely to keep well. For fairness’s sake, I have excluded all of the great content published by my colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>Without Further Ado</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the stuff you might not expect. The paper “<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2045255" title="Link: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2045255">Death and Taxes and Zombies</a>” follows on the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm" title="Link: http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s guide to surviving a zombie apocalypse</a>, and actually provides an interesting window into estate planning. Adam Chodorow’s meditation on determining whether a zombie is alive or dead is worth reading in and of itself, but the paper affords some serious insight into what happens taxwise when you or a partner die. If you hand it to a client, they are likely to actually read it. Plus, it contains the phrase “while it seems unlikely anyone would become a zombie for tax purposes,” so you know it’s good.</p>
<p>Were a zombie apocalypse to actually occur, it would likely become important to stop it. In that case, I’d want whoever was in charge of responding to have read the excellent paper, “<a href="http://www.donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/" title="Link: http://www.donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">Leverage Points: Places to Intervene In a System</a>,” by Donella Meadows. This is perhaps the best introduction to the analysis of complex systems that I can imagine, and I find myself continuously referring to her framework when I am structuring my own response to an issue.</p>
<p>In thinking through responses to complex issues, it is common to use the word “strategy” . . . in many cases again and again. If you’ve ever heard someone use the word and found yourself muttering, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk">You keep using that word . . . I do not think it means what you think it means</a>,” you need to read “<a href="https://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy" title="Link: https://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy">What Is Strategy?</a>” the seminal paper from Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter. I love the idea of looking at companies as systems of activities, which Porter does almost magically well here. It’s also worth reading because someday somebody might ask you what strategy is, and you should probably have an answer.</p>
<p><strong>Time for Some Investing Stuff</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes people ask you for a quick thing to read about investing, and that can be tough to respond to well. Fortunately, Walter Schloss typed out a list, entitled “<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mh02dj0g41t9u36/schloss_factors.pdf?dl=0" title="Link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mh02dj0g41t9u36/schloss_factors.pdf?dl=0">Factors Needed to Make Money in the Stock Market</a>,” that fills that gap nicely. It also offers the opportunity to make a very important point about investing information: the shiniest, best-packaged information is almost never the most valuable.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom often falls into that category. Many have been told that it is impossible to beat the market. It is probably hard, but those who hold that view need to examine the fantastic work Antii Petajisto has done in “<a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v69.n4.7">Active Share and Mutual Fund Performance</a>.” It’s not only quite readable but may fundamentally transform the way you think if you have been browbeaten into believing there is no point in attempting to practice the craft of investing.</p>
<p>I have two more recommendations in this category. One you likely expect (pictured below) and another that you really should have a look at. The <a href="https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=0E0A3525-EA60-2750-71CE20B5D14A7818">Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook</a> is perhaps one of the most valuable documents printed each year. For the sort who likes to know how the world is coming along, it is truly required reading.</p>
<p>This next one I hope you were able to guess. After all, the author is more or less responsible for CFA Institute existing. . . .</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="890" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/wFDWLRs8VA/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;v=4&amp;wp=1316&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.cfainstitute.org&amp;rp=%2Finvestor%2F2014%2F12%2F05%2Fweekend-reads-zombies-strategy-and-the-future-of-the-planet%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A0%2C%22os%22%3A1636.0000000000002%7D"></iframe>
<p><strong>Thinking Long-Term</strong></p>
<p>In closing, I’ll leave you with a number of “long-range planning” documents for homework over the upcoming holidays. It’s long surprised me that people don’t think it’s important to listen when the Chinese government tells you what it’s planning to do, the <a href="http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-who-we-are">US National Intelligence Council</a> talks about the trends it sees materializing, or the UN lays out broad goals for human development. These documents are perhaps one or two levels of magnitude less material than the Magna Carta or the Declaration of Independence to the path of human history, but that doesn’t mean it’s altogether improbable that your grandchildren will learn what’s discussed in them in history class someday.</p>
<p>First, if you’re at all concerned that China is slowing down, you need to read <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/China-2030-complete.pdf">China 2030</a>, which was published in 2012 by the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> and China’s <a href="http://en.drc.gov.cn/" title="Link: http://en.drc.gov.cn/">Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC)</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, don’t you want to know <a href="http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/global-trends-2030" title="Link: http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/global-trends-2030">what the US National Intelligence Council thinks are going to be the biggest trends</a> in the same time horizon? I’d candidly be disappointed if you didn’t, and fortunately they’ve even made their report available in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Global-Trends-2030-Alternative-ebook/dp/B00ALRNHPM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355145543&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=global+trends+2030">Kindle format</a>.</p>
<p>How do both of these documents compare with investment reality? Let’s ask investment reality. The <a href="http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2014_en.pdf">World Investment Report 2014</a> issued by the UN tracks flows in foreign direct investment (FDI) and issues commentary about what’s happening in the world. It’s worth at least a skim.</p>
