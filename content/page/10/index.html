<p>Where are the returns coming from?</p>
<p>If I teach you nothing else, remember that question. It's one of the most important things you can ask as an investor. And if you keep asking it until you're blue in the face, you're all but guaranteed to learn something.</p>
<p>So let's look past our <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">flagship strategy's</a> handsome headline performance figure of 33.51% together.</p>
<p>The chart below shows all of the companies that we owned at one point in 2023 and their contributions to overall performance. We've used their ticker symbols in place of their names to save space. Companies that we don't own anymore as of 1/1/2024 are denoted with an asterix (*).</p>
<p>One more note before we get into this: I'm mostly talking about financial returns in this piece. A supplemental piece where we talk about the real-world impact each company generates will follow shortly.</p>
<p><img alt="Image showing the return contribution by stock of the Global Opportunities strategy in 2023" src="images/2023-Return-Attribution-Global-Opportunities-1024x466.png"/></p>
<p>I'll briefly discuss the top five contributors and detractors from performance before comparing our performance with our index.</p>
<h4 id="top-5-detractors-from-2023-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#top-5-detractors-from-2023-performance">Top 5 Detractors from 2023 Performance</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enphase (ENPH)</strong> was our single largest detractor from performance, which you might expect from a stock that was down roughly 50% in 2023. The solar power industry as a whole was a poor performer in 2023 thanks to changes in California's net metering laws that substantially reduced the industry's sales momentum. But we believe great businesses are built in downturns like these, and as long-term investors we have complete confidence in the management team led by the indefatigable Badri Kothandraraman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crocs (CROX)</strong> was the second-largest detractor from performance after momentum slowed at Heydude, a footwear brand it acquired in early 2022. This has produced a degree of financial indigestion as markets struggled to make sense of what to expect from the newly combined entity. We reduced our position during the year and cannot profess blind faith in the management team. With that said, we believe shares offer compelling value at the moment, with a ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of roughly 15%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alexandria Real Estate (ARE)</strong> was the third-largest detractor from performance as the slowing commercial real estate market affected valuations of all companies included in commercial real estate indices. But Alexandria's hyper-specialized business of providing lab space to innovative biotechnology companies can hardly be thought of as similar to mainstream commercial office buildings. We are willing to wait until the market recognizes this firm's value, and expect to be paid handsomely in the form of dividends, reinvested cash flow, and price appreciation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>American Tower Corporation (AMT)</strong> We exited this position on concerns that liabilities associated with the lead cables used to connect their cellular towers to their networks were not fully contained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HDFC Bank</strong> <strong>(HDB)</strong> This bellwether bank has significantly lagged behind the rest of the Indian stock market as it digests a complex merger process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="top-5-contributors-to-2023-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#top-5-contributors-to-2023-performance">Top 5 Contributors to 2023 Performance</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Farmer Mac (AGM)</strong> It's appropriate that our single largest position since inception would be the single greatest contributor to our portfolio's performance. Much of the reasoning <a href="https://investvegan.org/why-we-own-farmer-mac/">we shared back in January 2022</a> remains unchanged, and we have grown the position since that post to almost 15% of our ethical growth strategy. As a portfolio manager, one of my largest fears is that the market will come to recognize the value of this unique company before I can buy even more of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Duolingo (DUOL)</strong> The market afforded us the opportunity to buy into this remarkably impactful firm at a discount to its IPO price, and we did so in size. In the ensuing months, an old-school bubble in everything and anything vaguely linked to AI took hold, and the price appreciated significantly. We're no longer holding quite as many shares of this firm. But we challenge anyone to watch CEO <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration">Luis Von Ahn's 2011 TED talk</a> on the thesis for Duolingo and walk away anything but inspired and excited. Today, shares are only about 70% above their summer 2021 IPO price, and the company continues to grow revenues at a remarkably stable 40% a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TopBuild (BLD)</strong> I can't help but smile every time I think of this position, which we've held since the strategy's inception. In 2022, market prognosticators were calling for a recession, which cut the price of this insulation distributor down to half the current level because sales of insulation products are broadly seen as tied to the housing cycle. But the compelling operational footprint that this company has carefully assembled over decades combined with the real-world cost savings that good insulation offers building owners to create a wonderful financial equation as they thoughtfully consolidate their industry over the coming decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E.L.F. Beauty (ELF)</strong> This company needs no introduction for any makeup users reading this piece. They produce cruelty-free competitors to costly beauty staples at a remarkable clip, and are experiencing accelerating revenue growth as they penetrate deeper into traditional sales channels while retaining an ironclad hold on gen-z and cost-conscious consumers. The only reason it's not a larger position in our portfolios is that <a href="https://investvegan.org/our-process/">our process</a> requires us to be mindful of valuation, and the company is regularly in the most expensive decile across a range of metrics. With that said, we're likely to be shareholders for many years to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quanta Services (PWR)</strong> This company has a commanding position in infrastructure services, which includes renewable energy, communications, pipeline maintenance, and almost everything related to the electrical grid. Their approach to safety has long captivated me, and the company has been a prime beneficiary of the federal government's infrastructure spending. With a sales backlog that may be larger than their $30 billion market capitalization by now, this company is profoundly well prepared for whatever future may come.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="comparison-with-our-index"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#comparison-with-our-index">Comparison with our Index</a></h4>
<p>On the face of things, we substantially outperformed our index last year.</p>
<p>That's relatively simple to establish: The Ethical Growth strategy's 33.51% return was larger than the MSCI ACWI's 22.27% return.</p>
<p>But it's also not the most complete analysis, since many of the largest contributors to the index's returns are excluded from all of our strategies for ethical reasons. These are companies like Amazon, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nestle, Exxon, and McDonald's that generate profits for their shareholders at great cost to the rest of us.</p>
<p>To facilitate a better comparison, I cross-referenced my attribution of the MSCI ACWI's returns with our proprietary ethical exclusions library to produce the chart below. It shows that applying the same ethical exclusions to our index would have reduced the index's return to less than 15%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/2023-Benchmark-Comparison-Global-Opportunities.png"/></p>
<p>This mostly serves as a reminder that there's more to portfolio management than just removing companies with sketchy practices from your portfolio.</p>
<p>Many investment firms will represent that they are able to take your ethical criteria and apply them to portfolio management, but it's not enough to simply eliminate the companies that act badly. For best results, you need a team that is willing to truly inhabit the restricted universe that your ethics imply.</p>
<p>I'm grateful that many of you have chosen us to perform that work for you, and look forward to doing it for many years to come.</p>

<p>If you ever stroll by my family's booth at the Elephant's Trunk Flea Market in New Milford, Connecticut, you'll be greeted by an uncommon sight for this day and age: several folding tables packed with rows and rows of antique dolls.</p>
<p>Some are propped up individually on fragile wire stands, while others are set down and sprawled about in groups.</p>
<p>Some are in mint condition, while others are far from whole (missing original eye(s), arm(s), hair, etc.).</p>
<p>To most modern eyes, these once-treasured toys are nothing short of nightmare fuel.</p>
<p>I mean:</p>

More to come later...but this piece is tagged a whopping $325.

</figure>
<p>That said, the dolls also induce a strong sense of nostalgia for those who played with them in the past. And this means that there's a fairly strong cohort of collectors who find them irresistible.</p>
<p>I'm not in this position by choice: my maternal grandparents were part of this passionate group, and when they left this world their amalgamation of oddities was bestowed upon my parents.</p>
<p>Now, we are faced with the daunting task of sorting through it all and finding new homes for each item. We've moved three times to this day, and the stuff has come with us each time — not in the back of a moving truck, but in piecemeal trips made by my father and I.</p>
<p>Though each doll does not need its own seatbelt, these trips have always been taken with preservation in mind.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how much we actually have, the entire inventory takes up about 2,000 square feet in the form of doll districts that proliferate in the garages, sheds, barns, nooks, and crannies of our life.</p>

<p>We do occasionally indulge in "getting high on our own supply" - scooping up an antique for our own personal use if it so happens to charm us. These acquisitions — alongside some free history lessons — are my favorite features of this strange business.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-contact-with-markets-and-valuation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#my-first-contact-with-markets-and-valuation"><strong>My First Contact with Markets and Valuation</strong></a></h3>
<p>I was once a pre-teen tagalong while my parents who frequented these flea markets and doll shows. And back then, the pricing behind antiques was more or less a mystery.</p>
<p>I thought that old was equivalent to expensive, so to me this stuff was essentially gold.</p>
<p>I'd watch dolls, toys, and dollars exchange hands quicker than the cryptocoins were selling off when FTX collapsed.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today: an environment in which making a sale is <em>much</em> more difficult, and as mentioned earlier, one where most folks will take a look at our wares, mumble something along the lines of "ha, creepy" and simply shuffle along to the next booth.</p>
<p>In the event that we do find ourselves in a position to sell a doll, there's an obvious question: what's it worth?</p>
<p>And it's tricky, to say the least.</p>
<p>Because dolls are not securities. They have no future cash flows for us to discount. They're just art, which means their value is strictly a function of what people are willing to pay.</p>
<p>The preface to <em>Expectations Investing</em> — which Sloane put on my desk as part of my training — discusses how investing differs from art collecting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why is one painting worth millions of dollars and another worth a few hundred?" Bernstein asks. Even in a book as prescriptive as <em>Expectations</em> <em>Investing</em>, we learn that "No calculations can answer that question; the owner merely hopes that another art collector will step up to justify today's selling price at some point in the future." So is it all just up in the air?</p>
<p>Peter Bernstein, Preface to Expectations Investing, P. XII</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, an antique Bebe Jumeau French doll sits up for bid on eBay at just $31. Simultaneously, an antique Tete Jumeau French doll in better-off shape is priced at a whopping $5,400.</p>
<p>That's quite a difference between the two, and I wonder if anyone will ever pay that $5,400.</p>
<p>Though condition (i.e the extent to which a doll shows its age) is an important factor in valuation, and can often explain stark differences in price like the example above, there are several other considerations which should not be disregarded.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scarcity,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provenance,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venue,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance or "book" value,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the collector profile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Careful study of these won't produce a formula for valuing dolls or any other antique for that matter.</p>
<p>Instead, they offer an x-ray of my brain activity and the item-specific idiosyncrasies that are effectively summarized into the price of each doll.</p>
<p>This shows how convoluted the valuation of <em>anything</em> can really be.</p>
<p>I've been in plenty of situations where a "top-tier" doll, according to historical pricing and the framework I used, should have sold for exponentially higher than it actually did. These same considerations apply to any antique, and often influence the price of other assets (including stocks).</p>
<p>Let's examine each of them in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="condition-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#condition-of-the-antique"><strong>Condition</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>Condition is a function of many factors: storage method, being played with or displayed throughout the years, original material, and of course, age.</p>
<p>Storage method and original material sometimes go hand in hand: for example, a bisque doll like the French ones described earlier are best stored facedown if they have glass eyes. Fluorescent lights also turn dolls green, which obviously damages and devalues them.</p>
<p>The original material can also create vast deviations in condition, value, and price.</p>
<p>For example, French and German dolls of the early 1800s were made of papier-mâché. Untinted Bisque, a delicate and more adult-oriented material came about later, and tends to increase value today. These untinted pieces were made with the intention of being objets d'art, and can possess extraordinary details.</p>
<p>Both materials are quite fragile and volatile, but unique in their own ways.</p>
<p>Any doll from the 1800s, unless preserved by a line of meticulous folks who never took it out for a tea party would likely be in worse condition today than a 20th century reproduction.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, collectors prefer their pieces to be as close to mint condition as possible. The newer it looks, the more you can typically try to ask.</p>
<p>However, there are always exceptions - one gentleman comes to our table looking for parts he can use in rehabbing disheveled dollies. We call him the "arm guy".</p>
<figure>

![](images/IMG_0636-683x1024.jpg)

<figcaption>

This doll's chipped eyes either speak of all the fun it once had or the neglect it suffered. But they also bring its financial value down quite a bit.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="scarcity-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#scarcity-of-the-antique"><strong>Scarcity</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the second easiest concept to understand is that of scarcity.</p>
<p>There aren't many antique dolls which were produced with the intention of being "rare" today. However, a variety of factors can surround a doll with an authentic (or synthetic) sense of scarcity.</p>
<p>The first step in establishing this is to identify the antique. There is usually a maker's mark or other identifiers on the tags if clothing is present. Once proper identification is accomplished, the internet is your most valuable resource in determining whether or not an antique is scarce.</p>
<p>Some key questions you should ask yourself include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When was the last time a comparable doll was sold online? What price did it realize?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any other examples for sale today?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have I browsed/engaged with various forums and/or contacted my network to see if this is a sought-after or scarce piece?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list could go on and on, but hopefully these spark some ideas - at risk of seeming repetitive, this certainly isn't a science.</p>
<h3 id="provenance-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#provenance-of-the-antique"><strong>Provenance</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>The chronology of ownership, or provenance, of an item can offer great transparency into it's origin, authenticity, and even its scarcity.</p>
<p>Isn't it interesting how the different considerations keep overlapping?</p>
<p>A doll with a detailed, documented provenance will typically fetch a higher price than a doll without. However, like in any form of art, forgeries can and do exist. I've never come across a fake, but have heard stories of them existing (and fooling unsuspecting collectors).</p>
<p>A counterfeit or fake is not to be confused with a reproduction, which was created to resemble its older counterpart but not fool anyone into thinking it <em>is</em> truly older.</p>
<p>In my experience, reproductions have somewhat "flooded" the market and had a negative impact on the value of true antiques. Folks have also knowingly and unknowingly passed off reproductions as originals.</p>
<h3 id="venue-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#venue-of-the-antique"><strong>Venue</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>There are an overwhelming amount of avenues where one can sell these, including flea markets, true "doll shows", eBay, and word of mouth. The last two are not concrete physical venues, but interestingly enough account for a large share of sales volume.</p>
<p>The concept of venue and how it relates to valuation can be usefully simplified: one would likely have an easier time selling umbrellas at a sunny beach than on a ski slope.</p>
<p>The same can be said in this business. Doll shows tend to garner higher demand than a standard flea market - which subsequently allows asking prices to come in higher at the former. But they come with higher costs for dealers like us, and offer no guarantee of a great day of sales.</p>
<p>There's no hard and fast rule when it comes to venue, though, and we've been able to get rid of some high profile ($500+) dolls after meeting a dedicated collector through another client. High profile collectors will often show up at standard flea markets too.</p>
<h3 id="insurancebook-value-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#insurancebook-value-of-the-antique"><strong>Insurance/Book Value</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>The 16th Blue Book of Dolls (we actually lost our copy) is a prime example of a source that provides uniform <em>guidance</em> from a market expert(s) on insurance or "book" value.</p>
<p>This metric can also be thought of as the "replacement cost" of a doll.</p>
<p>However, in 2020, one reviewer said the Book was "a little outdated for true values". To further this point, another reviewer from 2013 said that "Due to ongoing fluctuations in realized online auction prices, the Blue Book values are no longer firm, but still serve as general guides for comparative pricing."</p>
<figure>

![](images/IMG_0644-1024x683.jpg)

<figcaption>

This is a great example of _very_ outdated pricing. I'd feel like a grifter if I got $325 for a doll missing all of their limbs and outfit, and I'd be shocked if a piece like this could be sold for $100 in today's market.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's also important to emphasize again that the Blue Book (or any other similar source) can say one thing about price, but as art, value innately stems from what the next purchaser/collector is willing to pay.</p>
<p>The key phrase here is "realized price." Blue Book can only indicate value, not determine it.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, this is also true of prices in the stock market. When we have our monthly rebalance meetings, Sloane often says that we must respect market movements, but also resist allowing them to define our understanding of a security's true value.</p>
<h3 id="the-antiques-collector-profile"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#the-antiques-collector-profile"><strong>The Antique's Collector Profile</strong></a></h3>
<p>The Collector Profile is my own concept that has had a profound impact on my valuation of dolls.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I haven't discussed the plain old concept of demand yet (which is super clever of you), and I'll explain why.</p>
<p>I believe that in valuing dolls, demand is just one component that makes up the entire collector profile. It is an important consideration, but does not outweigh the concept as a whole.</p>
<p>Let us consider a "perfect storm" scenario: a collector plans to attend a show in advance, and they budget several thousand dollars for the show. They end up finding their "grail" doll, which also happens to be in mint condition - I'd have a tough time believing that the seller of this hypothetical antique wouldn't be able to fetch a relatively high price.</p>
<p>But this collector profile would be a poor match if the same seller was looking to liquidate a box of spare arms and eyes. They'd be better off looking for a horror film prop director or creepy decoration aficionado. Or maybe even Arm Guy.</p>
<p>While the collector profile applies to individuals, it applies to the doll-market on a broader scale: if a unique collector profile doesn't exist for the specific doll in question, that piece will NEVER attain its true maximum value.</p>
<p>Further, someone with a desire to purchase it may <em>never</em> come along. It could sit in the Ahmed doll depot indefinitely, effectively worthless even to our cats.</p>
<p>It's a very real concern in today's market, since nostalgic elders — the key drivers of past market activity — are starting to move on.</p>
<p>Will a new pool of buyers ever come in and take their place?</p>
<p><strong>Some Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Assets come in all shapes and sizes, and so do the considerations that affect their value. And if no one actually comes along with a desire to <em>own</em> the asset, does it have any worth at all?</p>
<p>Over the coming years, I'm fairly certain that one of our clients will find themselves in possession of other obscure antiques. They might even be weird dolls, in which case this article will be particularly salient. If you find yourself in a position where you wish to sell them, I hope this series of considerations provides a starting point to do so.</p>
<p>If not, I hope the "x-ray of my brain when valuing a doll" goes to demonstrate just how intricate the difference between price and value really is.</p>
<p>As always, drop a line if you want to chat about dolls, stocks, or life! We love to hear from you.</p>

<h2 id="3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/">3 Practical Questions for Corporate Stewards about Decarbonization</a></h2>
<p>I feel for the many corporate directors and executives that are trying to chart a credible path towards net zero.</p>
<p>Best intentions, board-level buy in, and a big budget aren't enough to do the kind of deep decarbonization work that's necessary. And I'll eat a shoe if anyone can prove to me that all three of those conditions are present at even a plurality of corporations.</p>
<p>So what's a well-meaning manager to do?</p>
<p>In the conversations I've had with executives at the companies in our portfolio over the past year, I get the sense that there's a lack of useful guidance about what moving towards net zero actually looks like. As a practical matter, almost all of them probably assume that they need to start by hiring consultants to build a detailed estimate of their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.</p>
<p>And like, sure. That's a step.</p>
<p><strong>But it's the opposite of a functional understanding.</strong> Think about it: there's nothing wrong with hiring consultants, but it's a literal cry for help. And there are real limits to the contributions that third parties can make to something as central to long-term strategy as decarbonization.</p>
<p>So I've decided to clarify how we understand the problem, the sorts of corporate actions that matter to us, and where we see the biggest opportunities for near-term progress.</p>
<p>Whether you're considering investing in one of our strategies, wondering how to get your company on the right path, or just hoping to get your hands around the problem, I hope you'll let us know how we can make this more useful to you by leaving a public comment or sending us a private note.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-you-learned-recently"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-have-you-learned-recently">What Have You Learned Recently?</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/#overview-section-2">fifth National Climate Assessment</a> that was recently delivered to congress estimates that extreme weather events already cost the United States $150 Billion each year. That figure doesn't account for loss of life, healthcare costs, damages to ecosystem services, or what's happening in the other 194 countries on the planet.</p>
<p>Our black, brown, and indigenous siblings will doubtless experience the worst of this. But I also expect the direct costs of climate change to permanently kill the vibes in more than a handful of boardrooms. Uneven, extreme, and unpredictable changes always seem to catch at least a handful of companies unprepared.</p>
<p>The traditional corporate playbook has been to claim that such risks are well controlled.</p>
<p><strong>I categorically reject such claims</strong>. What I want instead (and consider to be table stakes) is a publicly available discussion of how a company has improved their understanding and control of these risks at least once a year for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>My favorite leaders already approach this conversation with humility, vulnerability, and candor. In the coming years, I hope they'll start to feel comfortable doing that in public.</p>
<p>And I'll never need another Christmas present if they start to normalize practices like sharing new words they've learned, exposing things they've gotten wrong, and asking for help or insight from their stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="what-capacity-can-you-build-in-the-next-three-years"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-capacity-can-you-build-in-the-next-three-years">What Capacity Can You Build in the Next Three Years?</a></h3>
<p>It might not be entirely clear how to go about capacity-building, so here are a few things leaders ought to contemplate charging their teams with in roughly ascending order of ambition, complexity, and career risk.</p>
<h4 id="source-carbon-removals1"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#source-carbon-removals1"><strong>Source Carbon Removals</strong><a href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#8662e7de-0fbc-41b0-94f9-61b89d7d60d8">1</a></a></h4>
<p>If you're still doing the spewing, it's time to get started undoing.</p>
<p>The carbon removal market barely exists today, but every single one of the roughly 2,600 organizations with a <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/">science-based net zero target</a> is wholly reliant on it to actually reach their net zero goal. Why? Because it's not particularly likely that any complex organization can truly reach zero carbon emissions by just decarbonizing their operations.</p>
<p>What are Carbon Removals?</p>
<p>Carbon Removals refer to processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere and demonstrably keep it from being re-emitted for extremely long periods of time.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/p/SBTi-purchases-analysis">only 32 companies</a> with these commitments had actually bought carbon removals as of September 2023. And according to <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/">cdr.fyi</a>, only about 120,000 tonnes of carbon removal have ever been delivered.</p>
<p>If your company plans to eventually purchase carbon removals at some scale in order to meet your net zero goal, you should begin immediately. And if you do not plan to participate in the market, say so.</p>
<p>Many corporate executives will feel that if they participate in this market, they will be expected to cover each and every ton of carbon they emit immediately. This can turn a well-intentioned climate plan into a weird spreadsheet game that's more about scoring arbitrary carbon points than manifesting impact.</p>
<p>Save us all some trouble and skip that step for now.</p>
<p>Instead, acknowledge that this is a multi-decade process that will require new internal sourcing capacity, supplier relationships, and strategic planning. Focus on quality over quantity, and remember that you're entering a new market that you will likely participate in for a long time. This is a rare circumstance where bravely taking baby steps will count as leadership.</p>
<h4 id="strengthen-industry-standards"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#strengthen-industry-standards"><strong>Strengthen Industry Standards</strong></a></h4>
<p>Evaluate any professional associations that may be relevant to your industry, and ask whether they're currently issuing guidance on how members should adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>Is that guidance good enough? If not, why not?</p>
<p>Remember that there is power in networks. In uncertain times, strengthening the soft infrastructure that surrounds you and your colleagues can be hugely clarifying.</p>
<p>The intended goal isn't just to elevate the status of your own company but to influence industry standards on decarbonization as a whole. This can actually enrich the quality of your own strategy by sourcing incremental inputs from a larger professional network and decrease the career risk of climate action by building momentum and broader buy-in.</p>
<p>It may also be possible and appropriate to create industry-facing resources that discuss your company's environmental processes, failures, and successes. In time, this could create a shared repository of knowledge that other companies can refer to when bolstering their own practices.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting you spill any trade secrets here. Take a page from the software industry, where it's common practice for engineering organizations to write about how they approach complex problems. In many cases, firms will even create open-source infrastructure that others can use to tackle these same issues. Do the folks thinking about decarbonizing your fleets feel like they can publish their analysis of the current trade-offs? If not, why not?</p>
<p>Lastly, take a long hard look at your lobbying activity. Are you advocating for stricter environmental regulations? I think you should be. This probably seems short-sighted, idealistic, and insane to some readers, but consider that it will also concretize the costs of credible climate action and build them into the cost projections of every major actor in your industry.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-your-stakeholders-saying"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/28/3-practical-questions-for-corporate-stewards-about-decarbonization/#what-are-your-stakeholders-saying">What Are Your Stakeholders Saying?</a></h3>
<p>Credible plans are intrinsically unique. Every business has its own ethos, targets, and constraints, and so should every climate action plan.</p>
<p>Done right, this won't create conflict between your company's idiosyncratic approach and the reporting required by the folks who oversee the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/">science-based targets</a> initiative. Instead, it will help translate the long-term ambitions you've committed to into shorter-term steps and tangible decarbonization progress.</p>
<p>Effective climate action will unfold in a dynamic process that responds to changes in technology, regulation, community needs, and your company's practical circumstances. Don't make the mistake of carving your approach in stone. Instead, celebrate what you've learned by sharing how and why your approach has evolved.</p>
<p>I love it when managers directly cite stakeholder feedback as the root cause for these sorts of updates.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It's straightforward: mainstream investors have been conditioned to care about ESG disclosures because they contain useful hints about whether a company is capable of considering and controlling risk holistically. The quality, diversity, and frequency of your stakeholder communications are the main mechanism that such considerations manifest through.</p>
<p>So instead of spending all of your time on the outlook for next quarter or next year, think about ways to give us direct visibility into how you manage those relationships.</p>
<p>It might be uncomfortable in the short term, but that's something we'll all have to get used to. Because even though there's material uncertainty in the path climate change will take, there is no reasonable projection that could be described as "comfortable."</p>

<h2 id="why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/">Why ESG Investing Has Been Such a Letdown</a></h2>
<p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing has gotten a lot of attention in recent years, as the promise of aligning portfolios with ethical values gained mainstream recognition.</p>
<p>But it's long past time to wonder whether it deserves all the hype.</p>
<p>Despite the promises of real-world impact, glossy brochures with pictures of solar panels on them, and a substantial weight of evidence indicating that these data can help mitigate financial risk if properly applied, the truth is that ESG investing often fails to deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>To help our clients, their friends, and the broader world make sense of this, we decided to explore some of the limitations of ESG data and discuss why it falls short of what individual investors tend to expect from it.</p>
<h3 id="the-illusion-created-by-esg-ratings"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#the-illusion-created-by-esg-ratings"><strong>The Illusion Created By ESG Ratings</strong></a></h3>
<p>One of the troubling aspects of ESG investing is the high ratings given to extractive businesses that are known for their negative impact on the environment and society.</p>
<p>Take Nestle, for example, a company that is almost synonymous with corporate greed to many of our clients and readers. Surprisingly, many ESG rating firms rate Nestle near-perfect, raising serious questions for me and many others about the validity and reliability of these ratings.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean the whole practice is worthless. Investment professionals are supposed to act with independence and objectivity for good reason: there are countless examples throughout history of rating agencies failing to properly perform their duties. One of the most notable is extremely recent: the "great recession" of 2008-9 was in part precipitated by rating agencies issuing inflated assessments of low-quality mortgage assets.</p>
<p>In reality, any investor worth entrusting your hard-earned dollars to ought to understand that it's unrealistic to wholly outsource investment decisionmaking to some scoring rubric or process.</p>
<h3 id="the-inherent-limitations-of-esg-data-and-all-data-for-that-matter"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#the-inherent-limitations-of-esg-data-and-all-data-for-that-matter"><strong>The Inherent Limitations of ESG Data... and all Data for that Matter.</strong></a></h3>
<p>Investment decision-making is fundamentally about making do with incomplete information.</p>
<p>Even if we were able to use these data to create accurate assessments of corporate alignment with social good, other data gaps would inevitably emerge in a thorough analysis.</p>
<p>At a certain level, there are just natural limits to what can be known.</p>
<p>Here's a somewhat personal example: I'm a transgender woman. And even though we pick the management teams and companies that we invest in with extremely carefully, I still assume that at least one (and likely more) of the super-sustainable companies in our portfolio is led by someone who believes I shouldn't be allowed to use an indoor bathroom.</p>
<p>That's largely why ESG data is geared towards anticipating and avoiding certain risks rather than driving impact or justice: financial risk is plain easier to estimate.</p>
<p>Think about it: If a company depletes water sources near its production facility that it relies on to create its product, it naturally follows that the firm will either pay punitive fees to source the stuff or experience a production slowdown. Both of these circumstances would result in foreseeable declines in revenue that a forward-looking investment strategy might well be able to profit from.</p>
<h3 id="disaggregating-vague-build-a-better-world-value-propositions-in-esg"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#disaggregating-vague-build-a-better-world-value-propositions-in-esg"><strong>Disaggregating Vague "Build a Better World" Value Propositions In ESG</strong></a></h3>
<p>In a recent webinar, I shared a stylized hierarchy of value propositions for sustainable investing with the assembled group. If you'd like to access that full discussion just click the image below. But give it a gander in any case, because I want to tell you a few things about it.</p>
<p><img alt='A stylized heirarchy of "better world" value propositions showing impact at the top of the pyramid, ' src="images/CleanShot-2024-05-23-at-17.13.22.png"/></p>
<p>At a high level, the premise of this chart is that the vague idea of "aligning with a more sustainable future" can be broken up into four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing externalities</strong>. This is the most basic reason that ESG (and the associated data) are important. Having access to information about the composition of a company's workforce, the carbon intensity of its operations, and the long-term planning processes it uses to prepare for a range of possible futures helps us know that their operations are not creating negative consequences for surrounding communities. Crucially, this can also help us gain confidence that the company is insulated from negative surprises, which goes a long way towards mitigating risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aligning with growth trends.</strong> Any version of "building a better world" includes building new tools, technologies, and infrastructure. And whether we're talking about safe housing for seniors, scaling renewable energy generation, or building better software for teachers, paying careful attention to what the world needs is a big help when designing investment portfolios. As analysts, we're able to work backwards from what's needed, identify large growth opportunities, and then ensure we own companies that are well-placed to meet those needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding stranded assets</strong>. As climate change unfolds and humanity reacts to it, substantial disruptions in financial markets are all but certain to emerge. These will never be entirely avoidable, but they are somewhat forseeable. Take the case of fossil fuels, which will hopefully be substantially less widely used sometime in the next couple of decades. The financial think tank Carbon Tracker estimates that <a href="https://carbontracker.org/investors-need-to-look-carefully-at-stranded-asset-risks/">$1 trillion of oil and gas assets are at serious risk of becoming worthless</a> as a result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Driving real-world impact</strong>. This is what most people think of when "sustainable investing" comes up. It's difficult to deliver and even more difficult to quantify, which has left many people with false understandings of what's possible. With that said, all of the strategies we manage seek to avoid preventable harm to living things while also contributing to positive real-world outcomes. With that said, we do our best to learn from the industry's past mistakes when discussing this with our clients, and will always seek to underpromise and over-deliver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these four components of "building a better world" is worth thinking about in isolation, but as a practical matter it's worth remembering that we pursue them is all at once. There is a substantial difference between driving positive change in the real world and protecting your hard-earned dollars, but we pursue them all at the same time as part of an integrated process.</p>
<h3 id="reasonable-expectations-the-key-to-satisfaction"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/11/13/why-esg-investing-has-been-such-a-letdown/#reasonable-expectations-the-key-to-satisfaction"><strong>Reasonable Expectations: The Key to Satisfaction</strong></a></h3>
<p>We focus on making sure that our clients have reasonable expectations about what to expect from the funds they entrust to us. That work is not just about the sustainability characteristics of the portfolios we design for them, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Helping current and prospective clients reach evidence-based understandings of <a href="https://investvegan.org/stock-market-performance-what-should-you-expect/">what returns they should expect from their portfolios</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding <a href="https://investvegan.org/gimmewebinar">regular webinars</a> dedicated to answering any question on the minds of our clients and broader community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a disciplined approach to growth, which includes ensuring that our <a href="https://investvegan.org/support/">support</a> resources are sophisticated enough to serve as a real-time resource for client issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At a high level, the attention we've paid to all of the holistic considerations above is meant to help you understand whether it makes sense to involve this firm in your life for the long-term. We think of ourselves as your purpose-built partner for long term investing, and would love the chance to demonstrate what that means.</p>

<h2 id="the-climate-conundrum"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/10/27/the-climate-conundrum/">The Climate Conundrum</a></h2>
<p>Here's a grim reality: <strong>we were born on a dying planet</strong>.</p>
<p>This has probably occurred to you before, though perhaps not in those exact words. In fact, I'm willing to wager that an awareness of this reality is a huge part of what motivated you to get on our email list in the first place.</p>
<p>So what can we do with this awareness? Here are three distinct steps I want you to take in roughly descending order of priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hold time and space to cope</strong>: Each and every one of us is a marvelous creature, but despite our many magnificences it bears mentioning that we didn't evolve to deal with this unprecedented reality. It's OK not to be OK while considering the impact of things that are outside our control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Figure out who you trust</strong>: Don't rush this. To gain a coherent sense of what's actually happening on this planet, one needs to spend time with copious amounts of information. You can either do this yourself (not advisable) or get involved with organizations like mine which are openly committed to advocating for a just transition and interested in helping you understand what that means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn how to ask for help</strong>: I consider this to be my largest personal growth opportunity. The world I grew up in taught me to be prepared at all times, minimize what I need from others, and never show weakness. But that's silly and even a bit unrealistic. Complex problems get solved through community engagement, not the work of lone geniuses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your mileage may vary, but I've found that each of these three steps has been profoundly useful to me on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Even just creating the understanding that coping is important has paid profound dividends for me over the years. And it's helped me to be radically present for others in times of stress or conflict, which i find tremendously rewarding.</p>
<p>After all, the core of my job is to be deeply aware of these and other realities, understand their practical implications, and make sure your investment portfolio reflects our latest, best, and most holistic understanding of what to do about all of it.</p>
