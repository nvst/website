<p><em>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Celebrating Easter and April Fool’s Day both on the same day feels appropriate in 2018.</p>
<p>Interest rates have risen again, and plenty of traders are waiting for the punchline.</p>
<p>My task this weekend starts with assuring you it’s all for real. If the world feels a little crazy, it’s because you are paying attention. But stick around. We’ll try to turn it into fun.</p>
<p>I found a lot of charts that I want to talk about, so let’s jump in with one that gives me very mixed feelings.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">President Trump’s tweets mentioning the stock market<br/>HT: <a href="https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ReutersJamie</a> <a href="https://t.co/fnxU2eXG0S">pic.twitter.com/fnxU2eXG0S</a></p>— Ronnie Stoeferle (@RonStoeferle) <a href="https://twitter.com/RonStoeferle/status/977123890391642112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>You have to wonder: Why all the silence?</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be that hard to come up with material to tweet about. Maybe he’s just being polite to his colleagues in the eurozone, who are contending with a sudden and surprising reversal in their macroeconomic fortunes.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The difference between the European and U.S. Economic Surprise Indexes is now the highest since 2012.

<p>The gap between upbeat headline economic statistics and dire lived experiences is not new to the United States. It’s been a reliable feature of post-Great Recession life. And you would expect the mood as it reverses to be buoyant.</p>
<p>So what’s killing the vibe?</p>
<p>The unfortunate side effect of growing faster than our trading partners is that it directs their money and attention here.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today has been the best day for the Dollar ($DXY) since Oct 26 - second best since the bear trend started at beginning of 2017: <a href="https://t.co/g31qZl2wFG">pic.twitter.com/g31qZl2wFG</a></p>— John Kicklighter (@JohnKicklighter) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnKicklighter/status/979085049663512576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>The dollar has caught a bid, and that’s just the beginning. I talked about the bond market’s “<a href="https://srvo.org/nine-charts-dangerous-curves">dangerous curves</a>” last month. Perhaps I should have written about dangerous lines instead.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">It feels ever more as though we can forget January's market melt-up. The Treasury yield curves (2s-10s) is now as flat as it has been since the first week of the year: <a href="https://t.co/KSN3M67gM4">pic.twitter.com/KSN3M67gM4</a></p>— John Authers (@johnauthers) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnauthers/status/978728983553564674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>The standard fear when this condition presents comes straight out of economics textbooks, where flattening yield curves are typically described as harbingers of a recession.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s not automatic.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/johnauthers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@johnauthers</a> Yield curve claim of Atteberry is at best questionable: circled are instances of US yield curve being as flat as today: <a href="https://t.co/DppQA72ASt">pic.twitter.com/DppQA72ASt</a></p>— James Mackintosh (@jmackin2) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmackin2/status/973571925279756289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>One might see the above chart, count the red circles, and conclude that in four out of seven cases a flattening curve is a sign that the party will continue for several more years. But of course, be careful. Anything is possible.</p>
<p>It does feel a bit weird, though, to hear the last few months’ trading described as a “bear market in bonds.” Thirty-year Treasuries have spent most of the month rallying and were trading at 3.01% at the close of business this Thursday. That’s 12 basis points lower than they were at the end of February.</p>
<p>As it happens, the long bond opened 2017 yielding 3.04%. That was a selloff from 2016’s open of 2.98%, but it’s hardly a bloodbath.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to minimize forward-looking concerns, like the increasing amount of the US federal budget going towards debt service payments.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The FRED Blog examines how rising interest rates affect government debt payments <a href="https://t.co/6RxV99thtu">https://t.co/6RxV99thtu</a> <a href="https://t.co/qLkDmQf68U">pic.twitter.com/qLkDmQf68U</a></p>— St. Louis Fed (@stlouisfed) <a href="https://twitter.com/stlouisfed/status/978977533914943490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>It’s hard not to feel that the market is evolving some very particular tastes regarding leverage.</p>
<p>Look in particular at how many “investment grade” bonds, in fact, receive the lowest grade: BBB.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Triple-B issuers - which are loading up on debt - make up nearly half the investment grade bond market <a href="https://t.co/YpFObBazk0">https://t.co/YpFObBazk0</a> <a href="https://t.co/l8HKsZQJNL">pic.twitter.com/l8HKsZQJNL</a></p>— Leveraged Loans (@lcdnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/lcdnews/status/979211057133686784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>Could this perhaps have something to do with the lack of “high-yield” bonds?</p>
<p>The profit-free nature of recent equity issuance certainly makes it seem like capital markets are feeling promiscuous.</p>
<p>And the experience of more seasoned offerings has shown that a company’s multiple can expand significantly as a reward for simply staying in place.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24STC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$STC</a> earnings trend has been flat to negative over past 10 years however,valuation is at all time high.

<p>Of course, that’s only true for individual equities.</p>
<p>Some active managers have been experiencing the opposite, turning in significant outperformance only to be greeted by a chorus of redemptions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Unreal: the Fidelity Contrafund has doubled SPX returns and crushed its peers yet sees nothing but outflows w/ -$15b out in last 12 mos, h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JSeyff</a> <a href="https://t.co/jp46UdDJyP">pic.twitter.com/jp46UdDJyP</a></p>— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/978288642383925248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>So I’d forgive you for wanting to go corporate. The market verdict seems to be that consistently manufacturing alpha isn’t worth quite as much as an ability to say “We’re Number 1” frequently and with tremendous conviction.</p>

<h2 id="weird-ideas-conference"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/03/05/weird-ideas-conference/">Weird Ideas Conference</a></h2>
<p>I’m thinking about organizing a weird ideas conference.</p>
<p>Its mission would be to embolden open curiosity in the field of investment management. Ideally, a spirit of “I might be crazy, but I’ve done the work” will permeate the whole thing. Any marketing intention will be judiciously screened out, and presenters will be held to strict standards of credibility, brevity, and clarity. </p>
<p>I’ll do everything I can think of to make sure everyone present feels engaged and able to express themselves. </p>
<p>The event would most likely be held on a weekday in Bushwick, Brooklyn, cost less than $100, and take a little more than a half day. </p>
<p>Here are some subjects I’d like to discuss in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The innate weirdness of investing.</li>
<li>Investment lessons from the crypto.</li>
<li>What is mainstream thinking, exactly?</li>
<li>Rumors, conspiracy theories, and other forces shaping geopolitics.</li>
<li>The cost of “status quo” policy in real terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to add to the above, but also to intersperse a series of “lightning talks” throughout the programming. These would be ten minute presentations on an intentionally wide range of topics. </p>
<p>If participating in this sounds fun to you, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVPeknCqvT80Jr4866fNtlFC5H0HlXpy1xKg3NTvhkw41FOA/viewform">please fill out this brief survey</a>.</p>

<p><em>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>The prospect of rising interest rates has been discussed for long enough that every investor on earth ought to be ready by now.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s not exactly how it works.</p>
<p>To many in the market, bonds play a nearly sacred role. They are volatility-dampeners in chief, tapped into a portfolio for their ability to mitigate occasional stock market jitters. Whatever else one thinks about them, their contractual interest and principal payments make them a nice asset to have around in a risk-off moment.</p>
<p>At least that used to be the case.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2018/02/22/when-stocks-and-bonds-fall/">Michael Batnick, CFA, described</a> the regime change we’ve been seeing so far this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“in the 8 days that the S&amp;P 500 fell at least 0.5%, bonds declined in all but 1 of those days. I would expect this number to come down as the year goes on, but finishing above 50% would not be unprecedented. In 1999, stocks fell at least 0.5% 79 times, and bonds fell 48 of those 79 days.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So: What’s Happening?</strong></p>
<p>There’s only one place to start: The interest rate environment has materially evolved.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">U.S. Yield Curve: <a href="https://t.co/q6LU63HaYX">pic.twitter.com/q6LU63HaYX</a></p>— Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) <a href="https://twitter.com/M_McDonough/status/968513171005886464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>As I listened to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/a-fed-duet-janet-yellen-in-conversation-with-ben-bernanke/" title="Link: https://www.brookings.edu/events/a-fed-duet-janet-yellen-in-conversation-with-ben-bernanke/">Ben Bernanke interview Janet Yellen</a> recently, it was hard not to see their era in sepia tones. Things have definitely changed.</p>
<p>We’re worried about the economy being too good now. Not, like, ending. As was the fear for a stretch of Mr. Bernanke’s tenure.</p>
<p>And that means it’s time to hike.</p>
<p>The market seems to have noticed this slight difference in the tone of their successor at the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Investors now handicapping most hawkish Fed since 2010 following this afternoon's release of the January FOMC meeting minutes <a href="https://t.co/F4tOcbBreG">pic.twitter.com/F4tOcbBreG</a></p>— 博思乐 (@boes_) <a href="https://twitter.com/boes_/status/966419801831890944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>The outlook doesn’t seem so great for bond prices, and they haven’t looked this good as a financing alternative in more than a decade.</p>
<p>If these agreeable conditions persist, one imagines that the observations offered by Martin Fridson, CFA, on <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/08/25/forecasting-fixed-income-default-rates/">forecasting fixed-income default rates</a> will come in handy to a healthy proportion of our readers.</p>
<p>Now, none of this means bonds are devoid of appeal. Some <a href="http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2018/02/20/the-seven-kinds-of-asset-owner-institutions/">asset owners are prohibited from owning anything else</a>. And bonds have held central roles in diversified investment portfolios since what feels like the beginning of time.</p>

<p>But, to state the obvious, rising rates are a headwind for bond prices.</p>
<p>And an era just ended at the Fed. We’re likely to see a few spillovers.</p>

<p>If interest rates were just rising in a parallel shift, all of this would be less of an issue. </p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/04/30/with-bonds-dont-panic-about-rising-rates/">Stanley Kogelman discussed the consequence of a parallel rise in the yield curve with colleague Pat Light</a> a few years ago, and offered a recipe that may still suit a material proportion of readers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“if you are concerned about rising rates and you aren’t convinced that you can perfectly time duration adjustments to your portfolio, you should be more comfortable sitting back and assuming that over the course of time, you’re going to get the initial yield or the initial rolling yield of the portfolio that you anticipated.”</p>

<p>Maybe it’ll work out, but the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y">curve is flattening as it rises</a>. And as usual with this sort of thing, there’s no shortage of reasons why.</p>

<p>Absent a trip to Latin America, there are a few other steps you can take to get ready for this environment. CFA Institute members can get a quick refresher through our one-hour module on” <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/onlinelearning/Pages/52387.aspx">Yield Curve Construction, Trading Strategies, and Risk Analysis.”</a></p>
<p>There are also some provocative observations in the <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/dig.v36.n4.4301"><em>CFA Digest</em> summary</a> of a <em>Journal of Fixed Income</em> paper, <em>“</em><a href="http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/soe_research/456/">Profiting from Mean-Reverting Yield Curve Trading Strategies</a><em>.”</em> Here’s how Gerard Breen, CFA, described how a few different strategies performed from 1973 to 2004. The bold emphasis is mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The results suggest that for strategies pursuing mean reversion in the <em>absolute level</em> of yields, neither the strategy based on mean reversion of average yield levels across the curve nor that based on yield levels at individual maturity points can offer consistently superior returns. For strategies pursuing mean reversion in the <em>slope</em> of the yield curve, the authors find that trades involving mean reversion across the yield curve cannot offer consistently superior returns, although, conversely, those involving mean reversion between just two adjacent points on the yield curve can. <strong>For strategies pursuing mean reversion in the <em>curvature</em> of the yield curve, both trades involving curvature across the curve and those involving the curvature of just three adjoining points on the curve are found to offer consistently superior returns.</strong> Finally, the authors find that <strong>the most consistently profitable and statistically robust of all the strategies is that which pursues mean reversion of the slope between two adjacent points of the yield curve</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="ski-fast-have-fun-dont-fall-down"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/02/23/ski-fast-have-fun-dont-fall-down/">Ski Fast, Have Fun, Don't Fall Down</a></h2>
<p>Ski racing is the kind of sport that stays with you.</p>
<p>It takes the form of weaker knees and troubled joints sometimes, but something special comes from trying your best to do something very hard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/sports/olympics/norway-skiing-olympics.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=C4285BB073CFE548AB0BE5A75B8C9B15&amp;gwt=pay">Bill Pennington recently wrote about the culture of Norway’s ski team in</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/sports/olympics/norway-skiing-olympics.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=C4285BB073CFE548AB0BE5A75B8C9B15&amp;gwt=pay"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, and it got me thinking: What can you really do to help an athlete win?</p>
<p>The piece’s headline — “The Ski Team That Sleeps Together Wins a Lot of Gold Medals Together” — implies a cuddle-centric strategy that fortunately is not the secret. Sharing beds is common for budget-strapped skiers, but a structure that deepens their relationships with teammates is not.</p>
<p>Pennington details five rules that fit pretty well into organizations both on and off the hill. Here’s the secret sauce:</p>
<ol>
<li>No jerks.</li>
<li>No class structure.</li>
<li>The social fabric of the group is paramount.</li>
<li>Talk to each other, not about each other.</li>
<li>Friday night is taco night.</li>
</ol>
<p>This recipe got six of their athletes ranked in the world’s top 30 at the same time. And at some level, sign me up. I am here for taco night in a way that I can be only for my closest friends.</p>
<p>But why is this such an ideal structure to grow in, and what can we learn from it that’s useful beyond entertainment?</p>
<p>I was never going to carry the Olympic flag, but I did spend more than a decade as an alpine ski racer and coach. It’s a craft, much like investing, and it takes a specific atmosphere to flourish.</p>
<p>I had the tremendous luck to learn under two legendary coaches: Carl Williams, who coached the Salisbury Ski Team for 45 Years, and Ron Bonneau, who took at least one of the College of Idaho’s teams to nationals every year from 1999 to 2011 and was deservedly named <a href="https://www.collegeofidaho.edu/news/ski-coach-bonneau-earns-national-recognition">US Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) Coach of the Year in 2016</a>. Carl has passed away and it’s been a while since I caught up with Ron, but it’s a safe bet both would endorse the framework.</p>
<p>These cultural factors are critical because ski racing is not a strictly pleasant experience. Remember: The goal of the sport is to go as fast as possible, often on the most dangerous part of the mountain. It will get icy, and then the ice will find ways to get even worse. It changes speed, catches skis, and grows ruts just to demonstrate character. As you improve, you are hitting a gate with your body at almost every turn. This leaves bruises and brittle plastic behind. When you’re done, you take off your skis, walk up the hill, and ski it again.</p>
<p>And your feet are cold the whole time.</p>
<p>So, in honor of the Winter Olympics and the athletes who prosper in chilly, challenging conditions, I thought I’d explore three of the big lessons I learned on the hill before launching into the usual weekend menu of links.</p>
<p><strong>1. “Bend ze Knees und ze Ankles”</strong></p>
<p>During Carl Williams’s career, the sport of skiing changed as much as anything else in the world.</p>
<p>He started coaching for Salisbury in 1965, which means not only straight skis but also plenty of colleagues from abroad. Apart from the <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14594652">US Army’s 10th Mountain Division</a>, there weren’t many Americans who could link turns.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a limit to how much experience you can import, and that’s how this came to be a catchphrase. I still crack up thinking of Carl describing teams of Austrians giving up on their American students after the exhortation to bend didn’t quite take. His impression of their frustration became something we repeated to each other out of intrinsic value — this was high school, after all — but the message is really important. There’s no point having the best of the best as instructors if you don’t speak the same language.</p>
<p><strong>2. Expect the Best Day Ever</strong></p>
<p>Ron Bonneau asked if I was breathing at the end of one of my first practice runs in college.</p>
<p>“Oh wow, I’m not making this team” was my immediate thought. But his point was that I wasn’t going to win anything all stressed out. Racers at the peak of their capabilities still need to overcome their mood. For Ron, the secret to winning was remembering why you are competing: It’s fun.</p>
<p>This is really easy to forget! Remember the bit above about bruises? The added intensity that comes with competing at the college level makes it easy to burn out.</p>
<p>If you can convince yourself that the day ahead of you could be your best ever, it’s a little easier to keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ski Fast, Have Fun, Don’t Fall Down</strong></p>
<p>Carl saw plenty of disruptive innovation on the hill: <a href="https://www.skiinghistory.org/news/short-colorful-history-ski-boots">plastic ski boots</a>, <a href="https://www.vaildaily.com/news/announcements/roots-of-racing-technology-meets-ski-racing/">breakaway gates</a>, <a href="https://www.skiinghistory.org/history/release-history-safety-bindings">heel release bindings</a>, and <a href="https://www.skiinghistory.org/history/evolution-ski-shape">shaped skis</a>. But there’s a central truth to the undertaking which never changed a bit, and so I’m pretty confident he shared the same secret recipe each successive year.</p>
<p>It’s easier said than done, but that’s sort of the point. Advice always works that way. But the happy-go-lucky attitude at the center of it has helped me in situations far beyond the back bowls of <a href="http://skibutternut.com/the-mountain/trails-conditions/trail-map">Butternut Basin</a> where we trained.</p>
<p>My thanks to Carl, to Ron, to all the teammates I shared their wisdom with, and to you for indulging me. Now, as promised, here are some links that I think you’ll enjoy.</p>
<p>Keep the optimistic spirit above in mind when I say: This might be the weekend when you finally “get” cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2 id="who-owns-the-assets-under-management"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/02/20/who-owns-the-assets-under-management/">Who Owns the Assets Under Management?</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this post for CFA Institute with my friend and colleague</em> <a href="https://www.thomasbrigandi.com/"><em>Thomas Brigandi</em></a><em>. It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Say whatever you want about the world, but there's never been a better time to be an end investor.</p>
<p>Many things investment professionals fear — fee compression, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain — benefit clients through higher account balances and lower fees.</p>
<p>Asset owners are the largest of those clients. Though they are frequently lumped together as "institutional investors," they can be as different from each other as any two individuals. The only characteristic they reliably share is size, which means their goals shape the market.</p>
<p>But what exactly are those goals? What do these organizations want?</p>
<p>Thomas Brigandi and his team of more than 400 volunteers began organizing the <a href="https://www.cfany.org/cfany-asset-owner-series/">Asset Owner Series</a> at CFA Society New York in 2015 with these questions at heart. Since then, they have hosted discussions among senior investors representing over $38 trillion in assets under management (AUM) or advisory (AUA). These candid, off-the-record conversations are open only to investment professionals. They will be increasingly available to CFA Institute members <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/07/11/1042700/0/en/CFA-Society-NY-The-Hong-Kong-Society-of-Financial-Analysts-Work-Jointly-to-Expand-Asset-Owner-Series-Globally.html">globally</a> at little to no cost, but only in person.</p>
<p>Institutional investors are characterized as "big fish" and "smart money," but what else are they? Though Asset Owner Series commentary is not for attribution, the perspectives offered in these forums have removed some of the mystery surrounding these institutions, particularly the seven major types of asset owners and the motivations that are driving them.</p>
<p>Here are these "big fish" in roughly descending order of their AUM:</p>
<p><strong>1. Pensions</strong></p>
<p>Pension funds are the largest asset owners, with $36.4 trillion in AUM in 2016, according to Willis Towers Watson's "<a href="https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/insights/2017/01/global-pensions-asset-study-2017">2017 Global Pension Asset Study</a>." They fall into four primary categories:
  - "ESG Research"
  - "Sustainable Business"
- "ESG Research"
- <strong>Corporate pensions</strong> are sponsored by a single employer or several related employers within a corporate group. Many are "defined-contribution" (DC) plans, which means the plan sponsor does not bear the investment risk. The largest corporate pension plans include those of IBM, AT&amp;T, and United Technologies. Edmund A. Mennis, CFA, and Chester D. Clark's <em><a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rf.v1983.n2.4716">Understanding Corporate Pension Plans</a></em> offers a thorough overview.
- <strong>Public pensions</strong> traditionally provide public employees in the United States and Canada with defined benefits after they retire. These benefits are based on a formula, not the investment returns of the beneficiary's contributions. Mark Harrison, CFA, provided a helpful <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/05/17/lessons-from-the-canadian-public-pension-fund-model/">primer on the closely watched and widely emulated Canadian public pension fund model.</a>
- <strong>Union pensions</strong>, called Taft-Hartley plans in the United States, are operated by groups of companies together with officials of the unions that represent their workers. They are common in the building trades, trucking, retail, and mining industries. Some of the largest and most influential are the 1199SEIU Pension and Retirement Funds, Broadway League, National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT), and National Electrical Benefit Fund.</p>
<p>Pensions tend to be conservative and often rely on <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/11/21/beyond-modern-portfolio-theory-liability-driven-investment-strategies/">liability-driven investment strategies</a> to ensure that funds will be available to pay benefits when they are due. <a href="https://vimeo.com/97883297">Some have raised concerns that these funds will not be able to fulfill their responsibilities.</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Insurance Company General Accounts</strong></p>
<p>Insurance companies tend to invest the premiums they are paid in order to boost their earnings. Globally, insurance company assets totaled about $23 trillion in 2015, according to the most recent insurance indicators <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=INSIND">asset data</a> from the OECD.</p>
<p>The liabilities assumed by insurers can vary considerably in their predictability and timeframe, which leads to significant divergence in how the portfolios created to offset them are managed. Differences in regulation, product mix, and competition will play a role in the ultimate composition of these portfolios, but we can lay out some high level differences.</p>
<p>The three primary types of general accounts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: Providing health insurance creates a predictable but short-term liability with high liquidity needs. Managers of these accounts will thus keep as much as 25% of their portfolio in cash to meet these demands, and will tend to have some equity exposure to allow for long-term growth. Aetna Capital Management and CIGNA Investment Management are some of the largest organizations of this kind.</li>
<li><strong>Life</strong>: These long-term liabilities are often offset through long-term fixed income instruments, like Treasuries and corporate bonds. Managers tend to be prohibited from holding large equity allocations, so will diversify into mortgages and other assets while holding proportionally small cash balances. New York Life Insurance and MetLife are examples of large life insurance general accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Property and casualty</strong>: These insurers face "lumpy" liability streams that they offset by keeping as much as 10% of their assets in cash and 70% in bonds. They will typically blend equities and other assets in the balance of the portfolio to provide for some long-term growth. Among the large property and casualty insurance general accounts are Chubb and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Warren Buffett is perhaps the most widely known investor on the planet and <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/09/11/chasing-warren-buffett-alpha/">has built his impressive track record</a> in part by shrewdly managing the portfolios of insurance companies. John L. Maginn, CFA, <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/cp.v1994.n8.3">explored how these entities operated in the mid-1990s</a> in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong></p>
<p>Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are state-owned investment funds whose investable asset base is derived from a country's reserves and has been set aside for intergenerational savings, reserve management, fiscal stabilization, retirement benefits, or development. Taken together, they <a href="https://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund-rankings/">manage just over $7.5 trillion in assets</a>.</p>
<p>Most SWF funding comes from budget and trade surpluses or revenue generated from the exports of natural resources. They are generally not liability-driven investors, and as such, can adopt a long time horizon in their investment activities. Some funds have pursued innovative strategies to exploit the <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cfm.v27.n1.10">"huge advantage"</a> their unique nature affords them, while others have <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/dig.v43.n4.30">fallen prey to political pressures</a> and underperformed.</p>
<p>The roughly $900-billion <a href="http://www.china-inv.cn/wps/portal/!ut/p/a0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOL9DMwMDJ2DDbwMfB3dDBwtDFx9_Y29PL3dTPQLsh0VAbe5RsU!/pw/Z7_N0601CS0J0MAF0A80EMO3JIC03/ren/p=WCM_PI=1/p=ns_Z7_N0601CS0J0MAF0A80EMO3JIC03_WCM_Page.37c7bb2f-53b1-4742-b47e-38d857981f67=2/p=CTX=QCPchina-invQCAportalQCPhome_enQCPMEDIA_enQCPPress_Releases_en/=/">China Investment Corporation</a> is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds, and also provides an interesting case study on the mechanics of operating such a fund. The fund's chief representative, Felix P. Chee, discussed <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cp.v28.n4.1">how the fund approaches portfolio construction and risk management</a> in 2011.</p>
<p>A more detailed case study can be found in <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/op.v2018.n1.1"><em>Multi Asset Strategies: The Future of Investment Management</em>,</a> edited by my colleague. Larry Cao, CFA. The sixth chapter details the evolution of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. The closely watched fund does not reveal its AUM, but the US State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/investmentclimatestatements/index.htm#wrapper">estimated</a> they were in excess of $300 billion in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>4. Investment Consultant Outsourced CIOs</strong></p>
<p>The majority of large investment consultants have outsourced CIO practices. <a href="http://www.pionline.com/article/20170626/ONLINE/170629919/complex-portfolios-spur-increased-use-of-outsourced-cios"><em>Pensions &amp; Investments</em>' database</a> shows total OCIO assets reached $1.69 trillion as of 31 March 2017.</p>
<p>An OCIO will often manage all or a portion of the asset owner's investment portfolio with discretion to make and monitor changes. The OCIO divisions of investment consultants differ from the core investment consulting business, which is to provide asset allocation and asset manager selection advice to asset owners. Collectively, investment consultants advise on trillions of dollars in asset owner assets under a nondiscretionary, advisory-only framework. Mercer, Russell Investments, and Aon Hewitt Investment Consultants are among the largest of these organizations.</p>
<p>Hiring one of these firms can "present significant advantages for a small fund," as they bring significant expertise in investment management and manager selection, according to Jeffrey V. Bailey, CFA, and Thomas M. Richards, CFA, in their <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rf.v2017.n3.1">primer for investment trustees.</a> Though they also warn that the model comes with drawbacks, most notably that "the natural checks and balances of standard solutions" are somewhat lacking.</p>
<p><strong>5. Single Family Offices</strong></p>
<p>A single family office (SFO) is a private company that manages investments and trusts for one family. The number of family offices in the United States has grown to more than 3,000 with total AUM between $1 trillion and $1.2 trillion, according to Capgemini's <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf">"Global State of Family Offices Report</a>. These organizations can cost more than $1 million a year to operate and thus are mostly used by the wealthiest of the wealthy.</p>
<p>The SFO's sole function is to centralize the management of a family fortune. SFO staff manage investments, taxes, philanthropic activities, trusts, and legal matters. SFOs are privately owned by high-net-worth families, so not much information on them is available to the public. Prominent SFOs include Willett Advisors, which invests the personal and philanthropic assets of Michael Bloomberg; the Heinz Family Office; and SAFO (Shari Arison Family Office) Investment Company.</p>
<p><strong>6. Endowments and Foundations</strong></p>
<p>Endowments and foundations (E&amp;Fs) are large pools of money that benefit a specific charitable cause. Endowments tend to serve educational institutions while foundations write grants for a wide range of causes.</p>
<p>In the United States, 805 college and university endowments and affiliated foundations collectively had over $515 billion in endowment assets, according to the <a href="http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/EndowmentFiles/2016-NCSE-Press-Release.pdf">2016 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments</a>. A further $865 billion is held by foundations, according to the <a href="http://data.foundationcenter.org/#/foundations/all/nationwide/top:assets/list/2014">Foundation Center's database</a>. E&amp;Fs pay out on average 4%–5% of AUM each year to their specific cause.</p>
<p>No asset owner has a longer time horizon or is able to assume greater risk. E&amp;Fs have a perpetual life and no defined liability stream, which led to the evolution of the alternatives-heavy "Endowment Model" popularized by Yale University's David Swensen. David Chambers and Elroy Dimson explored the origins and evolution of this model in a <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v71.n2.7">recent article for the CFA Institute <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>®</a>. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest foundation, while Harvard University has the largest endowment.</p>
<p><strong>7. Multi-Family Offices</strong></p>
<p>There are an estimated 150 multi-family offices (MFOs) in the United States with about $400 to $450 billion in AUM, according to Capgemini's <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf" title="Link: https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf">"Global State of Family Offices Report</a>." They provide a range of services similar to an SFO, but work with more than one family group. These services are available to wealthy clients with as "little" as $20 million in investable assets.</p>
<p>A MFO typically offers comprehensive investment solutions to affluent individuals and families, with some also handling other financial matters, including budgeting, insurance, wealth transfer, and tax services. Some notable MFOs are Bessemer Trust and Rockefeller &amp; Co.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>
<p>Many aspects of the investment landscape are set to change, but these asset owners are likely to remain at the center of the market for many years to come. So if you still have questions, Owen Concannon, CFA's <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/ind.v2015.n1.1">exploration of the asset management industry</a> may be the next place to look.</p>
<p>There's no substitute for primary sources, though, so we hope you'll <a href="https://www.cfany.org/cfany-asset-owner-series/">come meet us in person</a> at your local CFA Society to find out why.</p>
