<h2 id="a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/">A Subtle Rebuttal to an Energy Realist</a></h2>
<p>Larry Siegel recently <a href="https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2024/06/24/realist-assesses-energy-transition-laurence-siegel">put forward the argument</a> that radically reducing carbon emissions is incompatible with civilization on a planet of eight billion people.</p>
<p>He goes on to argue: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A full energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables will not happen. We are going to continue to emit a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and, as the economist and blogger Tyler Cowen is reputed to have said, "Mostly we're going to see how hot it gets."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tremendous respect for Larry. His work as Director of Research at the CFA Institute Research Foundation was a big part of my life in the nine years I spent on staff at CFA Institute. But the dichotomy between sustainability and prosperity that he presents is false. And his logic is not just flawed, but also seductive and therefore dangerous. </p>
<p>With that said, it wouldn't be particularly useful of me to simply say that I disagree. The investment community is rife with differences of opinion: they're literally required in order for the market to function. So I see it as my responsibility to not only wade into this discussion, but to voice my dissent constructively.  </p>
<p>The architecture of Larry's argument is fairly straightforward: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Access to energy is a necessary precondition for economic growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy demand will increase as countries in the global south grow their economies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting all this demand with current renewable energy technologies is not plausible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fossil fuels are therefore the only way to meet the demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preventing climate change is impossible given all the fossil fuels we must burn, so all we can do is adapt to it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of this is undeniable, but also incomplete. </p>
<p>The climate has already changed in ways that may be irreversible, so it's impossible to disagree with Larry's conclusion that we ought to focus on adapting to climate change instead of preventing it. </p>
<p>But after thoughtful consideration of what adaptation might actually cost and involve, it's similarly impossible to conclude that blindly increasing our consumption of fossil fuels in a bid to boost growth is a sane path forward. The costs associated with Larry's plan would be profound, the growth he claims it would unlock may never materialize, and the ethics of putting such a plan forward are immensely problematic. </p>
<p>Over the following paragraphs, we'll take a deep look at what adapting to climate change actually means. Over the course of that exploration, it will become clear that the risks of acceding to this proposed future far outweigh the potential benefits. </p>
<h3 id="we-cant-know-what-comes-next"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#we-cant-know-what-comes-next">We Can't Know What Comes Next</a></h3>
<p>I wish we could take it as a given that the global south will experience the economic growth it needs over the coming decade. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a recent <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/04/14/the-great-reversal-prospects-risks-and-policies-in-international-development-association-countries">World Bank report</a> makes this impossible. The authors examined the seventy-five countries eligible for loans and grants from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), which are the poorest countries in the world by definition, and found some disquieting results.</p>
<p>The headline is stark: more than half of these countries are growing more slowly than the rich world. And fully one third of them are poorer today than they were at the onset of the COVID pandemic. This is a significant change from the past: We have to look back to the late 1990s in order to find a period where broadly increasing prosperity was this unusual. </p>
<p>I can't tell you exactly why this is, but here's one contributing factor: over the course of the last thirty years, jobs have reliably been created in lower cost economies as supply chains globalized in search of the most capital-efficient means of production. But after the frailties of this system were laid bare by the global pandemic, global companies began to "nearshore" or "friendshore" their operations in order to mitigate exposure to future shocks. </p>
<p>Firm-level benefits aside, further fragmentation of the previous world order is likely to have chilling effects on global economic growth. </p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2024/06/20/The-Price-of-De-Risking-Reshoring-Friend-Shoring-and-Quality-Downgrading-545774">IMF working paper</a> estimates a long-term global GDP loss of 4.5 percent if global economic integration reverts to its level in the year 2000, which was before China joined the World Trade Organization. Almost everyone would be worse off in this scenario, especially if tariffs and other barriers to trade were to be enacted as "corrective" measures. </p>
<p>And regrettably, some degree of such action is likely in the near future. To be clear: I am not predicting this. And I am certainly not rooting for it. </p>
<p><strong>But the reality is simple: broader, more inclusive global growth is not a foregone conclusion under any circumstances. Trends in global trade patterns that made it seem that way may be reverting just as costly challenges are materializing.</strong></p>
<p>Climate change is one of the most significant such challenges. Natural disasters already cost the average IDA country 1.3% of its GDP per year, and that has roughly doubled in recent decades. And though it's difficult to know exactly what will happen as the climate changes, the consensus view is that these disasters will intensify. </p>
<h3 id="lets-see-how-hot-it-gets"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#lets-see-how-hot-it-gets">Let's See How Hot it Gets</a></h3>
<p>Here in the intermountain west, it's already obvious that a little bit of warming goes a long way. There is more than 300 million tons of dead wood in Colorado's forests that's rapidly drying into tinder for future wildfires. </p>
<p>This isn't just nightmare fuel. It's also the state's fastest growing forest carbon pool.</p>
<p>New, healthy trees don't automatically grow back in their place because the ecological niches these species have evolved to inhabit no longer exist. </p>
<p>This is far from an aesthetic consideration: these trees have historically provided a far-reaching suite of services to the surrounding ecosystems. And even if we had the data and audacity to claim that we fully understand these support structures, we won't be able to replicate them without colossal, costly effort.  </p>
<p><strong>This single spillover effect from climate change has already turned the skies in New York City orange, caused more than half of the most dangerous air pollution in the American West, and left our ecosystems vulnerable to invasive species.</strong> </p>
<p>And this is ground truth, not a projection. </p>
<p>If we move towards the future on the path Larry proposes, we have no ready means of knowing what we will unleash.</p>
<p>The climate scientist slang for a future of fossil-fueled economic development is "taking the highway," and the IPCC has a dedicated model to describe it. They refer to it as Shared Socioeconomic Pathway(SSP) 5-8.5. </p>
<p>It's really quite a fascinating model, but it can be difficult to draw functional conclusions from without a bit of help. Fortunately, a <a href="https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/">new web app</a> from spatial ecologist Matthew Fitzpatrick at the University of Maryland can help us imagine the disruptions that lurk down that path.</p>
<p>The app extends and updates a 2019 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08540-3">analysis</a> published in <em>Nature Communications</em> to allow anyone to see how the climate is likely to change in 40,581 places and 5,323 cities around the world under SSP5-8.5. </p>
<p>Some of these allegories are dramatic: "If you happen to live in New York City, you would need to travel to northern Mississippi to experience what New York is expected to feel like by 2080. Say hello to hot, really humid summers and goodbye to snow in winter." </p>
<p>But the profound danger of Larry's plan becomes even clearer when we take a tour through the largest equatorial cities. By 2080, the climate in Lagos, Kinshasa, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Riyadh, Accra, Dar Es Salaam, and Manila will have changed so starkly that there is nowhere on earth we can look to as an analogy. And that's not a complete list. </p>
<p>Taipei and Singapore will suffer the same fate, so in this future we can at least look forward to a tidy natural experiment that will demonstrate whether — and to what extent — wealth will work to shield us against an unearthly reality. </p>
<p>Not everything is bad and getting worse. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is back to record coral cover, for instance. And though that should cheer us, it's important to remember that these advances come after a <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/protecting/our-investments#:~:text=Together%20with%20the%20Queensland%20government,crown-of-thorns%20starfish.">$5 billion funding commitment</a> from the government of Australia. </p>
<p>With that in mind, it's reasonable to wonder what other costs would mount as the planet warms further. And remember that proceeding upon a development path that ignores those costs creates liabilities that will encumber future economic growth when they come due. </p>
<p>On this subject, my central insight is not that hard to grasp: it's much simpler to avoid a mess than clean up after one. The interlinked ecological systems affected by the climate are profoundly complex and already struggling. </p>
<p>Investment professionals like me and Larry have a clear role to play in helping society navigate the implications of this, but we'll need to have a good, hard look at our professional ethics in order to do that effectively. </p>
<h3 id="capital-gains-for-me-ruin-for-thee"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#capital-gains-for-me-ruin-for-thee">Capital Gains for Me, Ruin For Thee</a></h3>
<p>My most profound misgiving about Larry's line of argumentation is that he will not experience anything close to the worst outcomes of climate change. </p>
<p>As a fellow American and member of the investor class, both he and I are not just geographically remote from the worst of these outcomes, but will likely be able to afford whatever tech-enabled tools arise to mitigate the reality he advocates for.</p>
<p>Most folks in the global south would have no such succor, yet Larry would say he is writing out of concern for their prosperity. Underneath a chart that presents a clear linear relationship between energy use per capita and GDP per capita, he writes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Economic growth is pushing almost every country... toward prosperity. Pushing them back... would be the cruelest joke ever played on what Frantz Fanon called "the wretched of the Earth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would hate to be involved in a cruel joke of any form, so let's embrace the premise that there's a straightforward path to sustained growth in any given country for a second. We'll restrict our analysis to a single country - the Democratic Republic of the Congo - to keep things fairly tangible. </p>
<p>Imagine that after adopting our fossil fuel led development agenda, Congolese GDP grows constantly at the fastest clip observed in any single year since 1960 — 9.7% — for each of the fifty-five years between us and the year 2080. Assuming no change to population size, their GDP per capita would reach roughly the same level we enjoy today in the United States. </p>
<p>Would that be worth it? </p>
<p>From the narrow standpoint of global investors, maybe. Even just one growth story of that magnitude would unleash a bonanza for us capital markets types. And if we buy the premise that Larry's plan would unlock growth of a similar magnitude across the global south, it gets very easy to anticipate describing our net worths with an extra comma or two. </p>
<p><strong>But at what cost, and to whom?</strong> </p>
<p>After 5°C worth of global warming, any remaining Kinshasans would likely have to contend with fatal wet bulb temperatures throughout the rainy season. It's possible that the mining industry would find ways to keep employees safe enough to keep the flow of critical minerals going, but that might involve wearing something akin to a space suit whenever they go outside. The agricultural sector — which currently employs about three-fourths of the country's labor force — would be eviscerated.</p>
<p>Are the people of the Congo asking for this? Do they have the strong democratic institutions that would be necessary to grant their informed consent? We can certainly find individuals who align with Larry's thinking, but that's a long way away from a popular consensus. </p>
<p>The moral argument Larry makes is particularly seductive to western ears. But I'd like to foreground something James Baldwin said in the 1970 documentary <em>Meeting the Man: James Baldwin in Paris</em> as we explore it.<em>.</em> </p>
<p>Here's the quote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You, the English, you, the French, you, the West, you, the Christians. You can't help but feel that there is something you can do for me. That you can save me. And you do not yet know that I have endured your salvation so long, I cannot afford it anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upshot here is straightforward: whatever their motivations, western interventions aimed at promoting prosperity are not necessarily welcomed by the folks they seek to support. </p>
<p>Think about how much would need to go right for future Congolese people to celebrate this plan retrospectively. </p>
<p>Growth would have to come fast, then last. </p>
<p>And even more unlikely: we must assume that both the political will to do something about all of the resulting negative externalities and the technology to actually get that done would arise at some point. </p>

<p>I don't want to run the risk of mischaracterizing Larry or Mark Mills, the analyst he quotes extensively in his essay. So there's a big quote from them coming soon. But because their argument talks a lot about GDP growth, I'll first remind you that Simon Kuznets — the economist who came up with GDP — had the following to say about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDP 'measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope having that handy makes the next few paragraphs a bit more fun for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The proportion of the world's GDP spent on energy-in-the-large, including food and animal feed, has decreased by an order of magnitude since the early modern era. A society that spends upwards of 70 percent of its income on food and fodder is poor indeed...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/AD_4nXe616uR0Ks1VTv2VO2eOTnvlREHqn0IlbVXDr2ccuVvooOYuQsFwiLENJvoQgjrHYE-qIPx85U8ISUY-_fkp_UN2xg03fGbyIHdv7koSrxX7ygVtnLnFOr2CsmyIbsqbTtizo8JqWYqBGOawQcBbDzf-nNu?key=onMyQ6TvvwXik9hTgP-qag"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But energy costs as a share of GDP didn't really fall off a cliff until the rapid industrialization of the nineteenth century, powered by coal and then oil and gas. </p>
<p>This may be counterintuitive: don't heavy industries use a lot of energy? Yes, but an industrial economy is so much more productive than an agricultural and handcraft economy that the denominator – world GDP – grew massively. </p>
<p>Thus, the energy share fell even as the absolute consumption of energy soared. Interestingly, the energy share of GDP has remained about the same – around 10 percent –since the early 1900s. </p>
<p>This is not because energy use remained stable, but because energy use and economic output exploded upward roughly in tandem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting that Larry and Mark celebrate the role of technological development in producing this output explosion, but neglect to consider it in their analysis of renewable energy technologies. Their case that the energy needed to fuel growth must come from fossil fuels rests on the unstated assumption that renewables technology will not improve.</p>
<p>This is ahistorical. </p>
<p>The cost of building new wind and solar facilities has declined by orders of magnitude over the past twenty years while their efficiency has grown by leaps and bounds. And new battery chemistries are emerging based on plentiful, inexpensive minerals like sodium which may further reshape the energy landscape over coming decades. </p>
<p><strong>In other words, today's renewable energy technologies may not be able to fulfill global energy demand, but tomorrow's might.</strong> </p>
<p>The 18th century economist Thomas Malthus used similar logic to argue that the supply of food could not keep pace with the growth of the human population. But new developments in agricultural technology intervened and our planet is now home to roughly eight times as many humans who enjoy a much higher standard of living than those ancestors. </p>
<p>So as we consider the argument that fossil fuels are the only source capable of meeting our energy needs, let's remember that things have a way of changing. The first patents for solar panels and wind turbines were only granted in the 1880s, and they've since evolved from novelties into economically viable alternatives. </p>
<p>This is particularly important because the path Larry and Mark propose has significant costs in addition to money. Average temperatures have already <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions">risen by .8°C</a> relative to their average between 1961 and 1990, and it's worth underlining that the order-of-magnitude increases in quality of living as measured by the cost of food and fodder had already materialized by 1900. </p>
<p>We have cell phones and the internet now, but also PFAS, and — according to <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2019/9/long-term-trends-in-deaths-of-despair">a great report</a> from the Republican side of Congress' Joint Economic Committee — a level of mortality from deaths of despair like suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease that "surpasses anything seen in America since the dawn of the 20th century." </p>
<p><strong>There's one thing we never had back then: plastic.</strong> </p>
<p>That's not particularly interesting at first glance. Production volume in almost everything has grown by leaps and bounds in the postwar period. But there is one particularly pertinent thing to remember about plastics: they're made of oil. </p>
<p>And demand for them is a huge part of global oil demand. To wit: the International Energy Agency's latest <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024">medium-term oil outlook</a> notes that Chinese imports of plastic polymers, synthetic fibers like polyester, and other intermediate petrochemicals produced roughly as much oil demand as the entire country of Germany in 2023. </p>
<p>The authors expect rising demand for petrochemicals (which, to be fair, is a much broader category than just plastics) to drive roughly three quarters of the increase in global oil demand between now and 2030. </p>
<p>And that's worth remembering as you read the first sentence of Larry's concluding section, which notes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some would say that it's worth sacrificing almost everything we value in life to "save the planet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the discussion is framed that way, it's easy to overlook the many tangible steps that can be taken to mitigate the negative effects of fossil fuel consumption. </p>
<p>I doubt anyone would sign up to live in an unrecognizable world in order to preserve some semblance of normalcy. But that's exactly the world that will result from Larry's proposed path forward: just think about all of the cities with an unearthly future that we've talked about.   </p>
<p>By contrast, a future with less plentiful polymers is a lot easier to stomach. Wouldn't you be willing to give up plastic bottles and polyester for a chance at a more sustainable future? Wading into trade-offs like this is at the heart of effective adaptation to climate change, which Larry and I agree is absolutely essential. </p>
<p>So what does it look like to take that challenge seriously?</p>
<h3 id="arise-acolytes-of-adaptation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/10/a-subtle-rebuttal-to-an-energy-realist/#arise-acolytes-of-adaptation">Arise, Acolytes of Adaptation!</a></h3>
<p>We won't make progress on anything without a cogent and comprehensive definition of the problem we're dealing with. </p>
<p>When we talk about climate change, we're often referring to a more complex set of changes linked to the consequences of human activity on the surrounding environment. </p>
<p>A team of researchers has helpfully <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh2458">enumerated</a> each of the nine planetary processes that are essential for maintaining the stability and resilience of the earth as a whole. The extra large illustration below shows those nine systems, as well as the riskiness of their current state.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Climate change is just one of these nine processes, and CO2 concentration is not even its most acutely stressed facet at the moment. That distinction belongs to radiative forcing, which is what happens when the amount of energy entering earth's atmosphere is greater than the amount that leaves it.</p>
<p>This framework invites us to think about the sustainability of activities in a fuller context. Take cutting down a forest for example: it has carbon implications to be sure, but also can lead the earth to absorb more solar radiation if the ground is darker than the forest that used to cover it. </p>
<p>Such activity also removes habitat, which can lead to the endangerment and extinction of species and a loss of genetic diversity in the biosphere. If the forest were to be replaced with farmland, there would likely also be increases in biogeochemical flows from the introduction of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Pesticides and other chemicals would likely come alongside them, introducing novel entities into the environment. And the farm would also have to be irrigated, which presages changes in freshwater use. </p>
<p><strong>These connections are straightforward once they've been illuminated, but will likely be new to most readers. If nothing else, they highlight how intricately linked these systems are and allow us to imagine the non-monetary costs associated with upsetting them further.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>But that's not all: they are also confounding for ideologues, who often put forward one big solution for all of the planet's woes.</strong> </p>
<p>Take electrification for example. The quote below that Larry shares from Mark Mills is undeniably true today: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world already digs up an amount of earth equal to 7000 Great Pyramids per year to shift from gas, oil, and coal to the minerals required for the energy transition. These include nickel, cadmium, tellurium, obviously lithium, and cobalt among other minerals. You would have to dig up 50,000 Pyramids' worth of the Earth each year to get [enough of] those minerals [to complete the transition].  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of that mining already has drastic consequences for the biosphere. To keep this essay readable, I'll refrain from enumerating all of them. </p>
<p>But readers rooting for the immediate and wholesale replacement of fossil fuels should be aware that they're advocating for something with profound spillover effects. </p>
<p>So where does that leave us? </p>
<p><strong>The messy gray area where progress actually happens.</strong> </p>
<p>In a perfect world, we could rely on a combination of environmental markets and regulation to accurately price the external costs associated with all human activities.</p>
<p>That world sounds nice, but we don't live there.</p>
<p>So as we think about how to reduce the harm associated with human activity, we need to resist one size fits all solutions and seek instead to understand the checkerboard of local realities that create the global energy picture. And the reality is that burning oil or natural gas would be a huge improvement in some places, since it would replace dirtier energy sources like coal. </p>
<p><strong>For as long as the world remains imperfect, it's incumbent upon analysts like me and Larry to embrace the reality that many things can be true at once. There is no "magic bullet" solution waiting in the wings to relieve our planet's many stresses, nor a simple tradeoff between economic growth and sustainability.</strong> </p>
<p>We live in a world with finite resources but infinite desires. And over the past century, we've allowed those desires to set the economic agenda without much interference. </p>
<p>None of us can put forward a complete solution to solve the climate crisis while preserving our economic prosperity, and we should acknowledge that at every opportunity. After all, we are in the business of making decisions amid conditions of uncertainty. And people often think that means we know much more than we actually do. </p>
<p>That's why, as we close this exploration, it feels important to draw attention to the malignant overconfidence with which us finance types can sometimes trod through thorny ethical terrain. </p>
<p>If we come to believe that we can speak with certitude on behalf of people we have never met about their own best interest, we imperil our ability to serve our social function, weaken our standing as a profession, and diminish ourselves individually in the process.</p>
<p>The only thing we can know about the future is that it's coming. The fuel that powers it, the technology that shapes it, and the people we'll share it with are yet to be determined. But it's likely that the world will stay an inherently subtle place no matter what happens, and I hope me and my colleagues at Ethical Capital will be here to help you embrace that nuance. </p>

<h2 id="what-we-own-and-why"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/">What We Own and Why</a></h2>
<p>We work hard to identify and invest in companies that generate positive real-world impact in the same way they generate revenue.</p>
<p>This isn't just about feeling good. For one thing, we consider companies with a positive, well-established role in a broader system to be more resilient than their competitors. They tend to be good stewards of their corporate assets, with well-established governance procedures and clear processes to mitigate conflicts with shareholders.</p>
<p>With that said, companies are social organisms with living, breathing components. Which makes it difficult to capture what makes them special with mere statistics. Fortunately, concentration is one of the hallmarks of our investment style. Which means it's possible for us to pull together brief narratives about our holdings which you can read through at your leisure.</p>
<p>This approach differs significantly from the way investment firms typically talk about impact.</p>
<p>The tendency is to produce reports which focus on a handful of issues like climate, waste, and water usage. But unfortunately, this can prevent clients and other stakeholders from developing a holistic view of how the portfolio's holdings interact with the world around them. This conventional approach can also focus your attention on data that is easily comparable and readily available, which overlooks much of the nuance of a deeper analysis.</p>
<p>Our approach has downsides too. It's more unwieldy than a slick infographic, short on portfolio-level statistics, and long on my own exposition. We are always looking to refine and improve our approach to this, so I hope you'll <a href="https://app.precisefp.com/w/ixj9du">share your thoughts</a> with us on how we can do better.</p>
<h3 id="whats-in-this-strategy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#whats-in-this-strategy">What's In This Strategy?</a></h3>
<p>We think of the holdings in our flagship <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">Global Opportunity</a> strategy as belonging to one of four verticals: Infrastructure, Innovation, Lending, and Real Estate.</p>
<p>The criteria for each is relatively straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real Estate companies generate revenue through the sale and rental of real estate,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure holdings generate revenue directly from a fixed physical asset or by selling goods and services to the operators of those assets,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation holdings generate revenue through novel products or business practices, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lending companies generate revenue by charging interest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Relative to our benchmark (The MSCI ACWI), we remain significantly underweight non-us companies at the moment, with roughly 78% of our overall holdings domiciled in the United States.</p>
<p>We are also significantly overweight Real Estate, Industrials, and Financial Services stocks, and have no current positions in the Basic Materials, Energy, Healthcare or Utilities Sectors, which are roughly 22% of our index.</p>
<p>The strategy's historical performance is shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/CleanShot-2024-06-03-at-12.28.22@2x-1-1024x515.png"/></p>
<h3 id="inside-the-verticals"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#inside-the-verticals">Inside the Verticals</a></h3>
<p>Breaking our portfolio down by industry verticals is helpful when analyzing our strategy. The table below shows some summary statistics for each of these four components, as well as their weight within the strategy overall.</p>
<p>Our focus on companies with solid business models that generate free cash flow is immediately evident from this comparison. Our strategy has more than three times the ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of its benchmark, which indicates that our holdings are extremely well-placed to make strategic investments or return capital to shareholders over the coming years.</p>
<p>Trading at roughly 60 times earnings, our Real Estate vertical might seem richly valued at first glance. We believe that current accounting earnings are not the best indicator of value for these asset-based businesses, especially in the midst of structural headwinds for the real estate industry. Our holdings are extremely well-positioned with high occupancy rates, deeply integrated into their local communities, and have been weathering the industry's recent stresses with aplomb.</p>
<p>We continue to see opportunity in each of our verticals, and our due diligence pipeline is full of high-impact lenders, innovative companies with misunderstood opportunity sets, and infrastructure investments that should benefit from significant secular tailwinds.</p>

| Vertical | Weighting | **Dividend Yield** | **PE Ratio** | **5 Year Revenue CAGR** | **FCF/Market Cap** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Real Estate | 13.85% | 5.27% | 59.38 | 21.07% | 6.27% |
| Infrastructure | 24.95% | 0.74% | 20.50 | 10.62% | 6.01% |

<h3 id="top-5-holdings"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#top-5-holdings">Top 5 Holdings</a></h3>
<p>The following five companies were the largest positions. These five positions comprised 42% of our overall holdings in this strategy as of June 3rd, 2024.</p>
<h4 id="agricultural-mortgage-corporation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#agricultural-mortgage-corporation">Agricultural Mortgage Corporation</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Lending</p>
<p>Known as Farmer Mac, this Washington D.C. based lender is a remarkable example of impact in action. Its core purpose is to increase the availability of long-term credit at stable interest rates for America's rural communities.</p>
<p>The company estimates that farmers and ranchers invest $2 locally for every dollar they save on interest expenses, which means the company's impact reaches deep into areas of the country that are just plain difficult to access.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the company is focused on growing its portfolio of loans to rural electricity cooperatives, which is a profound opportunity to compound their impact over time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Farmer Mac's core financial equation is a thing of beauty. They have delivered consistent returns on equity in the high teens, and more than 90% of their revenue is recurring. On top of that, the company is well placed to serve growth markets in renewable energy, fund investments that will be necessary to increase agricultural sustainability and productivity, and deepen the resilience of our agricultural system.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="alexandria-real-estate"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#alexandria-real-estate">Alexandria Real Estate</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Real Estate</p>
<p>This Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is focused on creating and maintaining the mission-critical lab space that innovative biotechnology companies require to develop life-changing therapies.</p>
<p>It was the first REIT to adopt this focus, and roughly three-quarters of its annual revenue comes from "clusters" of market-leading lab space in key centers of pharmaceutical R&amp;D like Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, and North Carolina's Research Triangle.</p>
<p>The company's tenants were responsible for 50% of novel FDA-approved therapies in the ten years ending 2023, which is nothing if not profound impact. And to our nerdy delight, the company has won numerous awards for the quality of its disclosures and financial reports in that period as well.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-2-1024x336.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Office real estate is in the doldrums at the moment, but lab space is uniquely insulated from the industry's high-level challenges because the work that happens inside of them can't generally be done from home. The company's revenues and cash flows are growing at healthy double-digit margins, but we have been able to purchase stock at valuations unseen since the financial crisis while other investors have been fleeing the industry.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="duolingo"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#duolingo">Duolingo</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>Duolingo's mission is to provide a private tutor experience to everyone on the planet through technology. Initially focused on just language learning, they have expanded their focus to include math and music in recent years.</p>
<p>Each of these areas unlocks significant economic opportunity for the learners that participate in them. Learning a new language is arguably the single most effective way to enable an individual to improve their economic situation since communication is necessary for most forms of high value work.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the company has used its power in the language learning market to introduce a new, lower cost, and more accessible language assessment test which is displacing the legacy Test of English as a Foreign Language, or TOEFL, which is a profound additional benefit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-6-1024x576.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Duolingo is a longstanding market leader in commercializing AI for public benefit, but it has recently come under assault from short sellers after supposedly competing translation products were unveiled by OpenAI and others. We think the threats are overblown: the company's learning system is extremely difficult to replicate, has significant growth opportunities ahead of it, and has been consistently growing revenues at more than 40% a year.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="lemonade"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#lemonade">Lemonade</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>Lemonade is a public benefit corporation organized "to harness novel business models, technologies, and private-nonprofiit partnerships to deliver insurance products where charitable giving is a core feature."</p>
<p>That alone is profoundly innovative. But the company's management team has been incredibly creative in the way that they fund their growth plans, which adds another layer of wonderfulness to an already-exciting proposition.</p>
<p>The company's insurance products have industry-leading net promoter scores around 70, and operate closer to breakeven than most insurance industry analysts tend to recognize. As their core demographic ages, we expect they will come back to Lemonade again and again.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/122-1225602_image-lemonade-insurance-logo-hd-png-download.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Lemonade is well capitalized with narrowing operating losses and annual revenue growth in excess of 40%. The next two years of growth should have remarkable implications for its bottom line as the company expands past breakeven, and we were able to buy in at a fifth of their IPO price.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="crocs"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#crocs">Crocs</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>This manufacturer of comfy clogs has been dismissed as a fad every year since they IPO'd back in 2006. But a look past the surface reveals an immensely innovative company that has consistently iterated on their core design to create something that is somehow both trendy and timeless.</p>
<p>The company is also well on the way towards replacing the plastic in its shoes with renewable materials, and aims to reach 50% bio-based materials by 2030. They have also rolled out a recycling program that offers discounts on new shoes to those who participate.</p>
<p>On its own, that's not so impressive. But the company has made huge strides towards enshrining comfort and utility in our popular culture, which is a significant form of impact on its own.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-9-1024x687.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> The company took on a significant debt load after acquiring Heydude, a complementary footwear brand, in 2022. Though concerning, this hasn't hurt the company's solid global growth trajectory, with both brands exceeding estimates as of the most recent report. As they pay down debt and continue on their growth trajectory, we expect free cash flow to continue growing by 25% or more over the coming years.</p>

<p>This outcry was long overdue.</p>
<p>And not just because the killing of Palestinian civilians is harrowing and wrong.</p>
<p>As the person in charge of designing and implementing some of the investment industry's <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/screening/">most stringent ethical guidelines</a>, I can say with some authority that the world's capital markets are full of ethical catastrophes that defy easy comprehension.</p>
<p>In other words, it would be something else if not Palestine.</p>
<p>And it will be something else after Palestine.</p>
<p>Your investment staff probably are not yet equipped to adjudicate the many complexities that come with managing money morally. But your student stakeholders are calling out for clearer moral lines about what their endowment stands to profit from.</p>
<p>I don't have to tell you that we've been down this road before. With fossil fuels and for-profit prisons, tobacco companies, and plenty more. And this time around, I am urging you: <strong>take the students seriously, not just literally</strong>.</p>
<p>The operational challenges of managing a modern endowment portfolio necessitate long-term planning. You've got to pace the maturation of your holdings to coincide with spending plans, produce a steady stream of consistent quality opportunities to match with incoming cash, and manage the complex communications associated with your own oversight.</p>
<p>I suggest you situate this entire discussion within that oversight process. The most effective way to take the students seriously is to build a moral oversight process and reporting framework that passes their muster. With such a thing in place, you will be able to make genuine long-term commitments without worrying about subsequent challenges from stakeholders.</p>
<p>There isn't one right way to build something like that: you will need to build and refine your own approach.</p>
<p>But we've learned a few things over the past few years that might be helpful to other long-term investors thinking about how to merge a little more morality into the way they do money management.</p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions that may be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Even if they've been operating under an ESG policy for years, deeply integrating ethical criteria into investment decision making will be new for most investment offices.</p>
<p>So was crypto. But unlike the blockchain stuff, building competency here is all but guaranteed to pay dividends for your organization. Think about it: this will not be the last moral issue you have to contend with. As you prune and populate your portfolio, wouldn't it be nice to have a handle on things that may impede your ability to act as a true long-term investor?</p>
<p>If you are thoughtful, earnest, and perhaps lucky, you will find a way to engage with your stakeholders that becomes a source of positive idiosyncrasy. That's a big part of what makes this firm special: our clients know that I want to hear about their moral concerns ASAP. As a result, we've got our ear to the ground in ways that would be difficult to replicate for folks who are just feigning interest.</p>
<p><strong>Make a Living List</strong></p>
<p>You will want a living document that describes the conduct and products that your stakeholders consider to be objectionable.</p>
<p>To make this easier, we have made our own <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/screening/">policy</a> available under a Creative Commons license that allows others to build upon it however they'd like. Our own policy has never felt like my property, as it has been iteratively refined in collaboration with our clients and was built upon the work that organizations like <a href="https://www.nbim.no/en/responsible-investment/ethical-exclusions/">NBIM</a> had done before us.</p>
<p>Our approach is unusual in that it allows me to overrule any of the individual criteria if I see an opportunity for constructive dialogue with the company or another means for the shareholding to manifest positive impact. This gives me substantial flexibility to use the tools at my disposal to drive impact, and avoids making ethical oversight into a box-ticking exercise.</p>
<p><strong>You Won't Miss the Stuff You Exclude</strong></p>
<p>I've overseen <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">our process</a> for almost three years at this point, and I'm still surprised how little I miss the companies that we've excluded for ethical reasons.</p>
<p>There are almost 3,000 issuers on our exclusion list for all manner of conduct and product-related sins. Of those companies, there are only a handful that I would consider sensible investments. The majority are on there for more than one reason. And when we update our exclusions to include new criteria, we often find new and exciting reasons not to miss them.</p>
<p>I believe there is an existential link between governance, ethics, and investability. And if you manage to identify that companies have endemic ethics problems, why <em>wouldn't</em> you remove them from your investable universe?</p>
<p><strong>Aquiesce to Active</strong></p>
<p>Ethical investing is active investment management. It is foolish to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>You can spend a lot of time and effort worrying about how to mean-variance optimize your holdings so that their volatility patterns match those of a broader index, but you'll miss a profound opportunity to recontextualize your investment program in the process. Your required rate of return is likely your ultimate benchmark, so why not use it instead of legacy indices?</p>
<p>After all, if you embark on an honest and searching divestment journey, it's likely that your holdings will look a lot different than the S&amp;P 500. And it will be a journey. I wrote <a href="https://ethicic.com/how-i-became-an-active-manager/">an essay</a> reflecting on my own path a few years ago that may be useful.</p>
<p><strong>Harness The Energy of your Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>I can't remember a time when young people were this interested in what's happening inside of their University's endowments. If I were working in one of these offices, I would be looking for ways to listen to these folks on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Why not survey students on a wide range of ethical issues to see where they stand? Or work to identify types of investments that would appeal to these stakeholders?</p>
<p>It can't be that hard to hire a facilitator to tease out the things that would be seen as exciting or equitable, and that idea generation work may lead to tangible opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Ask for Help</strong></p>
<p>I probably only have the bandwidth to engage in-depth with one investment office on this outside of facilitating access to our <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">flagship strategy</a>. But there are plenty of others out there who could be helpful, and I happen to be friendly with a lot of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.precisefp.com/w/ixj9du">Send us a note</a> if you'd like us to provide some ideas confidentially. But this suggestion goes far beyond anything I, my firm, or our community can do for you.</p>
<p>After all, the broad debate about divestment can get heated. But you've risen to the height of our profession, and likely have wise people whose counsel you rely on. As I said above, you'll need to evolve your own response to these student demands. Don't deprive yourself of their counsel.</p>

<p>If you ever stroll by my family's booth at the Elephant's Trunk Flea Market in New Milford, Connecticut, you'll be greeted by an uncommon sight for this day and age: several folding tables packed with rows and rows of antique dolls.</p>
<p>Some are propped up individually on fragile wire stands, while others are set down and sprawled about in groups.</p>
<p>Some are in mint condition, while others are far from whole (missing original eye(s), arm(s), hair, etc.).</p>
<p>To most modern eyes, these once-treasured toys are nothing short of nightmare fuel.</p>
<p>I mean:</p>

More to come later...but this piece is tagged a whopping $325.

</figure>
</figure>
<p>That said, the dolls also induce a strong sense of nostalgia for those who played with them in the past. And this means that there's a fairly strong cohort of collectors who find them irresistible.</p>
<p>I'm not in this position by choice: my maternal grandparents were part of this passionate group, and when they left this world their amalgamation of oddities was bestowed upon my parents.</p>
<p>Now, we are faced with the daunting task of sorting through it all and finding new homes for each item. We've moved three times to this day, and the stuff has come with us each time — not in the back of a moving truck, but in piecemeal trips made by my father and I.</p>
<p>Though each doll does not need its own seatbelt, these trips have always been taken with preservation in mind.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how much we actually have, the entire inventory takes up about 2,000 square feet in the form of doll districts that proliferate in the garages, sheds, barns, nooks, and crannies of our life.</p>

<p>We do occasionally indulge in "getting high on our own supply" - scooping up an antique for our own personal use if it so happens to charm us. These acquisitions — alongside some free history lessons — are my favorite features of this strange business.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-contact-with-markets-and-valuation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#my-first-contact-with-markets-and-valuation"><strong>My First Contact with Markets and Valuation</strong></a></h3>
<p>I was once a pre-teen tagalong while my parents who frequented these flea markets and doll shows. And back then, the pricing behind antiques was more or less a mystery.</p>
<p>I thought that old was equivalent to expensive, so to me this stuff was essentially gold.</p>
<p>I'd watch dolls, toys, and dollars exchange hands quicker than the cryptocoins were selling off when FTX collapsed.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today: an environment in which making a sale is <em>much</em> more difficult, and as mentioned earlier, one where most folks will take a look at our wares, mumble something along the lines of "ha, creepy" and simply shuffle along to the next booth.</p>
<p>In the event that we do find ourselves in a position to sell a doll, there's an obvious question: what's it worth?</p>
<p>And it's tricky, to say the least.</p>
<p>Because dolls are not securities. They have no future cash flows for us to discount. They're just art, which means their value is strictly a function of what people are willing to pay.</p>
<p>The preface to <em>Expectations Investing</em> — which Sloane put on my desk as part of my training — discusses how investing differs from art collecting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why is one painting worth millions of dollars and another worth a few hundred?" Bernstein asks. Even in a book as prescriptive as <em>Expectations</em> <em>Investing</em>, we learn that "No calculations can answer that question; the owner merely hopes that another art collector will step up to justify today's selling price at some point in the future." So is it all just up in the air?</p>
<p>Peter Bernstein, Preface to Expectations Investing, P. XII</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, an antique Bebe Jumeau French doll sits up for bid on eBay at just $31. Simultaneously, an antique Tete Jumeau French doll in better-off shape is priced at a whopping $5,400.</p>
<p>That's quite a difference between the two, and I wonder if anyone will ever pay that $5,400.</p>
<p>Though condition (i.e the extent to which a doll shows its age) is an important factor in valuation, and can often explain stark differences in price like the example above, there are several other considerations which should not be disregarded.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scarcity,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provenance,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venue,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance or "book" value,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the collector profile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Careful study of these won't produce a formula for valuing dolls or any other antique for that matter.</p>
<p>Instead, they offer an x-ray of my brain activity and the item-specific idiosyncrasies that are effectively summarized into the price of each doll.</p>
<p>This shows how convoluted the valuation of <em>anything</em> can really be.</p>
<p>I've been in plenty of situations where a "top-tier" doll, according to historical pricing and the framework I used, should have sold for exponentially higher than it actually did. These same considerations apply to any antique, and often influence the price of other assets (including stocks).</p>
<p>Let's examine each of them in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="condition-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#condition-of-the-antique"><strong>Condition</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>Condition is a function of many factors: storage method, being played with or displayed throughout the years, original material, and of course, age.</p>
<p>Storage method and original material sometimes go hand in hand: for example, a bisque doll like the French ones described earlier are best stored facedown if they have glass eyes. Fluorescent lights also turn dolls green, which obviously damages and devalues them.</p>
<p>The original material can also create vast deviations in condition, value, and price.</p>
<p>For example, French and German dolls of the early 1800s were made of papier-mâché. Untinted Bisque, a delicate and more adult-oriented material came about later, and tends to increase value today. These untinted pieces were made with the intention of being objets d'art, and can possess extraordinary details.</p>
<p>Both materials are quite fragile and volatile, but unique in their own ways.</p>
<p>Any doll from the 1800s, unless preserved by a line of meticulous folks who never took it out for a tea party would likely be in worse condition today than a 20th century reproduction.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, collectors prefer their pieces to be as close to mint condition as possible. The newer it looks, the more you can typically try to ask.</p>
<p>However, there are always exceptions - one gentleman comes to our table looking for parts he can use in rehabbing disheveled dollies. We call him the "arm guy".</p>
<figure>

This doll's chipped eyes either speak of all the fun it once had or the neglect it suffered. But they also bring its financial value down quite a bit.

</figure>
<h3 id="scarcity-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#scarcity-of-the-antique"><strong>Scarcity</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the second easiest concept to understand is that of scarcity.</p>
<p>There aren't many antique dolls which were produced with the intention of being "rare" today. However, a variety of factors can surround a doll with an authentic (or synthetic) sense of scarcity.</p>
<p>The first step in establishing this is to identify the antique. There is usually a maker's mark or other identifiers on the tags if clothing is present. Once proper identification is accomplished, the internet is your most valuable resource in determining whether or not an antique is scarce.</p>
<p>Some key questions you should ask yourself include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When was the last time a comparable doll was sold online? What price did it realize?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any other examples for sale today?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have I browsed/engaged with various forums and/or contacted my network to see if this is a sought-after or scarce piece?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list could go on and on, but hopefully these spark some ideas - at risk of seeming repetitive, this certainly isn't a science.</p>
<h3 id="provenance-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#provenance-of-the-antique"><strong>Provenance</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>The chronology of ownership, or provenance, of an item can offer great transparency into it's origin, authenticity, and even its scarcity.</p>
<p>Isn't it interesting how the different considerations keep overlapping?</p>
<p>A doll with a detailed, documented provenance will typically fetch a higher price than a doll without. However, like in any form of art, forgeries can and do exist. I've never come across a fake, but have heard stories of them existing (and fooling unsuspecting collectors).</p>
<p>A counterfeit or fake is not to be confused with a reproduction, which was created to resemble its older counterpart but not fool anyone into thinking it <em>is</em> truly older.</p>
<p>In my experience, reproductions have somewhat "flooded" the market and had a negative impact on the value of true antiques. Folks have also knowingly and unknowingly passed off reproductions as originals.</p>
<h3 id="venue-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#venue-of-the-antique"><strong>Venue</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>There are an overwhelming amount of avenues where one can sell these, including flea markets, true "doll shows", eBay, and word of mouth. The last two are not concrete physical venues, but interestingly enough account for a large share of sales volume.</p>
<p>The concept of venue and how it relates to valuation can be usefully simplified: one would likely have an easier time selling umbrellas at a sunny beach than on a ski slope.</p>
<p>The same can be said in this business. Doll shows tend to garner higher demand than a standard flea market - which subsequently allows asking prices to come in higher at the former. But they come with higher costs for dealers like us, and offer no guarantee of a great day of sales.</p>
<p>There's no hard and fast rule when it comes to venue, though, and we've been able to get rid of some high profile ($500+) dolls after meeting a dedicated collector through another client. High profile collectors will often show up at standard flea markets too.</p>
<h3 id="insurancebook-value-of-the-antique"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#insurancebook-value-of-the-antique"><strong>Insurance/Book Value</strong> of the Antique</a></h3>
<p>The 16th Blue Book of Dolls (we actually lost our copy) is a prime example of a source that provides uniform <em>guidance</em> from a market expert(s) on insurance or "book" value.</p>
<p>This metric can also be thought of as the "replacement cost" of a doll.</p>
<p>However, in 2020, one reviewer said the Book was "a little outdated for true values". To further this point, another reviewer from 2013 said that "Due to ongoing fluctuations in realized online auction prices, the Blue Book values are no longer firm, but still serve as general guides for comparative pricing."</p>
<figure>

![](images/IMG_0644-1024x683.jpg)

<figcaption>

This is a great example of _very_ outdated pricing. I'd feel like a grifter if I got $325 for a doll missing all of their limbs and outfit, and I'd be shocked if a piece like this could be sold for $100 in today's market.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's also important to emphasize again that the Blue Book (or any other similar source) can say one thing about price, but as art, value innately stems from what the next purchaser/collector is willing to pay.</p>
<p>The key phrase here is "realized price." Blue Book can only indicate value, not determine it.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, this is also true of prices in the stock market. When we have our monthly rebalance meetings, Sloane often says that we must respect market movements, but also resist allowing them to define our understanding of a security's true value.</p>
<h3 id="the-antiques-collector-profile"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/12/05/what-antique-dolls-taught-me-about-valuation/#the-antiques-collector-profile"><strong>The Antique's Collector Profile</strong></a></h3>
<p>The Collector Profile is my own concept that has had a profound impact on my valuation of dolls.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I haven't discussed the plain old concept of demand yet (which is super clever of you), and I'll explain why.</p>
<p>I believe that in valuing dolls, demand is just one component that makes up the entire collector profile. It is an important consideration, but does not outweigh the concept as a whole.</p>
<p>Let us consider a "perfect storm" scenario: a collector plans to attend a show in advance, and they budget several thousand dollars for the show. They end up finding their "grail" doll, which also happens to be in mint condition - I'd have a tough time believing that the seller of this hypothetical antique wouldn't be able to fetch a relatively high price.</p>
<p>But this collector profile would be a poor match if the same seller was looking to liquidate a box of spare arms and eyes. They'd be better off looking for a horror film prop director or creepy decoration aficionado. Or maybe even Arm Guy.</p>
<p>While the collector profile applies to individuals, it applies to the doll-market on a broader scale: if a unique collector profile doesn't exist for the specific doll in question, that piece will NEVER attain its true maximum value.</p>
<p>Further, someone with a desire to purchase it may <em>never</em> come along. It could sit in the Ahmed doll depot indefinitely, effectively worthless even to our cats.</p>
<p>It's a very real concern in today's market, since nostalgic elders — the key drivers of past market activity — are starting to move on.</p>
<p>Will a new pool of buyers ever come in and take their place?</p>
<p><strong>Some Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Assets come in all shapes and sizes, and so do the considerations that affect their value. And if no one actually comes along with a desire to <em>own</em> the asset, does it have any worth at all?</p>
<p>Over the coming years, I'm fairly certain that one of our clients will find themselves in possession of other obscure antiques. They might even be weird dolls, in which case this article will be particularly salient. If you find yourself in a position where you wish to sell them, I hope this series of considerations provides a starting point to do so.</p>
<p>If not, I hope the "x-ray of my brain when valuing a doll" goes to demonstrate just how intricate the difference between price and value really is.</p>
<p>As always, drop a line if you want to chat about dolls, stocks, or life! We love to hear from you.</p>
