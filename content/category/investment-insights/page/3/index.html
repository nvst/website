<h2 id="how-i-became-an-active-manager"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/02/25/how-i-became-an-active-manager/">How I Became an Active Manager</a></h2>
<p>I've been following the financial markets since I could perceive time.</p>
<p>I first got paid to do it at Oppenheimer &amp; Company when I was nineteen years old. Wally Davis and Chuck Posternak hired me as an intern at what's now the <a href="https://www.oppenheimer.com/grandcentralpcg/">Grand Central Private Client Group</a>. I was paid $15 an hour to build spreadsheets that described clients' financial situations and our associated asset management positioning.</p>
<p>It ruled.</p>
<p>I got to meet with fund managers, build models, and generally research stuff to my heart's content. I also had unrestricted access to a Bloomberg terminal, which was one of the more exciting developments of my adolescence. But it wasn't my first contact with markets. That came much earlier thanks to my parents, who were both enterprising in their careers and open with their experiences as I was growing up.</p>
<p><strong>My mom liked to joke that she taught me the difference between debt and equity before I could ride a bike</strong>. Which is more or less true. She and my dad had an imperfect marriage, but their shared interest in the capital markets gave them a source of conversation on long car rides. Mom eventually left her career at Lehman Brothers to teach AP economics at Stuyvesant High School (Forbes wrote <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0412/second-acts-clarissa-bushman-careers-teaching-book-value.html?sh=2d5ad05c2453">a great piece</a> about that transition) so I guess it makes sense that I think of myself as her first student in addition to her first child. The picture above is me playing with her briefcase shortly after I learned to walk.</p>
<p>My dad is also one of the most insightful analysts I've ever met. While I was cutting my teeth at Oppenheimer in 2007, he was warning everyone who would listen about leverage in the financial system and pushing the investment community to re-evaluate companies like General Electric that had become addicted to financial engineering. I still watch his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qqyYDmOfs">first tv appearance about it</a> every once in a while as a reminder of how deeply the markets can misunderstand a company.</p>
<p>Even with these fantastic firsthand experiences, <strong>I struggled to understand why individual investors should invest their money in anything but index funds</strong>.</p>
<p>This chart, which shows the total return of both General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 since dad first went on TV to talk about it, gives a good sense of why.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An investor who decided to bet against GE after dad's interview aired would have had to incur significant cost, manage mechanical complexities, and wait close to a decade for the insight to deliver any benefit to them.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, a simple index fund investor would have compounded their capital faster and had more time to think about other things.</p>
<p>That's what I call a win-win.</p>
<p>My confidence in this simple and straightforward approach only grew as I gained more information.</p>
<p>Joining CFA Institute in 2010 gave me an opportunity to dive deep into state of the art academic research that surrounds the practice of investment management in a context where my sole responsibility was to highlight tools, tactics, and technologies that investment professionals make better decisions on behalf of their clients.</p>
<p>I started out writing educational materials, but quickly got sucked into the organization's online community-building efforts. I was put in charge of recruiting expert voices for what eventually became the <em><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/">Enterprising Investor</a></em> (still the #1 investing blog in the world <a href="https://blog.feedspot.com/investment_blogs/">according to Feedly</a>) and jumped in with both feet.</p>
<p>The task was to connect with the most thoughtful investors I could find and convince them to put their thoughts into writing on our platform. That led to some profoundly interesting work. Notable explorations of the <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/02/27/what-is-the-difference-between-investing-and-speculation-2/">difference between investing and speculation</a>, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/09/11/getting-schooled-in-risk-the-lessons-of-poker/">what poker teaches us about risk</a>, and the <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/02/12/betting-with-buffett-seven-lean-years-later/">lessons from a famous bet with Warren Buffett</a> are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Eventually I got to add my own voice into the mix in addition to curating expert views. I wrote about <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/10/28/enron-revisited-highlights-from-bear-stearns-research/">what Enron can teach financial analysts</a>, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/07/12/finding-faith-in-value-after-all-these-years/">the role that faith plays in investment processes</a>, and whether ESG and sustainability <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/09/01/does-esg-boost-returns/">could enhance investor returns</a>.</p>
<p>We did a lot of stuff I'm proud of. I even wrote <a href="http://www.jasonapollovoss.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Investment-Idea-Generation-Guide.pdf">a book</a> with my friend and mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/theintuitinvest">Jason Voss</a> about how to come up with original investment ideas.</p>
<p>I still couldn't see why individual investors would invest in anything but an index fund.</p>
<p><strong>And then I came out.</strong></p>
<p>It was 2017. I had been experiencing gender dysphoria for my whole life. And I finally felt able to do something about it besides distracting myself. I changed my name, my appearance, and my pronouns with the benefit of a supportive work environment, then prepared myself for whatever might happen when the rest of the world noticed.</p>

_Yours truly in Institutional Investor back when it was still a paper magazine. The full article is [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b15yww7r3f1jpm/gay-on-wall-street)._

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The years I've spent connecting to other queers since coming out have taught me to take my values seriously, hold myself accountable to my best intentions, and continuously improve my ability to listen.</p>
<p>They have also made me comfortable with who I am. I <a href="https://freemoneypodcast.com/">started a podcast</a> with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/sovereignfund">Ashby Monk</a> to explore how the world's most sophisticated investors were working to build a better future for finance, and began writing the "<a href="https://citywireusa.com/registered-investment-advisor/author/sortel">Inclusion in Wealth</a>" column for Citywire RIA to explore issues around diversity, equity, and belonging in our industry.</p>
<p>But I still wasn't an active manager.</p>
<p>Until my girlfriend and I sat down to have the conversation about how we would invest our money, I would have said it was interesting but not particularly applicable. And yes, I would have offered a full-throated defense of index funds and passive management.</p>
<p>But when we actually enumerated our values, <strong>it turned out that I held some pretty extreme views</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Companies should pay their taxes,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid preventable harm to living things, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care for the communities where they operate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though I've expressed them fairly concisely above, those values actually summarize a two page, single spaced <a href="https://investvegan.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Exclusion-Criteria-1.pdf">policy</a> that excludes companies with questionable products, conduct, or both from our investment strategies.</p>
<p>But however well-constructed our policy is, it's unlikely to produce compelling results unless it's part of a coherent <a href="https://investvegan.org/our-process/">investment process</a>.</p>
<p>There's a simple reason for that: our screening process isn't good enough.</p>
<p>It can't be.</p>
<p>The capital markets are literally a manifestation of the world's current power structure. Anything that people do will find a way to concretize in them somewhere. So eventually I realized there is no checklist comprehensive enough to rely upon.</p>
<p>You have to pay attention.</p>
<p>Because companies often talk a big game, but are absent when it comes time to come through for their communities. Because our goal is not just to identify companies that are shaping the world positively but also to generate financial stability for our clients. So I can't just buy the stuff that makes it through the screens and pretend I'm making the world a better place.</p>
<p>That's not to say that index funds are bad. Far from it! I have Jack Bogle's autograph sitting above my desk, and I still think that they do an excellent job growing people's money without requiring much in the way of oversight or critical thought.</p>
<p>They just have nothing to do with ethics.</p>
<p>And as an ethics-first investor, I owe it to everyone evaluating my strategy to be clear that there is substantial independent judgement and discretion involved in what we do.</p>
<p>We do not "set and forget" anything. My purpose in starting this firm is to support a restless search for better, more complete, and more reliable investment options than currently exist. And there is nothing passive about that process.</p>

<h2 id="dont-stop-with-divestment"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/02/09/dont-stop-with-divestment/">Don't Stop With Divestment</a></h2>
<p>Fossil duel divestment is all the rage these days, with bellwethers like the Harvard University endowment joining a decades-long movement to banish hydrocarbons from their investment programs.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://divestmentdatabase.org/">Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Commitments Database</a>, they join 1500 other institutions representing a total of $39.88 trillion that have taken such steps. To people who care about the environment, this is great news! Surely the first step towards a post-carbon economy is to stop investing in new coal, oil, and gas projects. And grassroots groups like <a href="https://350.org/">350.org</a> have done a great job mobilizing people through their <a href="https://gofossilfree.org/">go fossil free campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>But what happens after they succeed?</p>
<p>Once one arrives at the conclusion that these hydrocarbon-intensive undertakings no longer belong in a long-term investment portfolio, I would suggest that it becomes natural to look around and see what else is potentially unfit for investment. After all, the energy industry isn't the only one with moral shortcomings.</p>
<p>Sadly, they abound.</p>
<p>Most proponents of divestment understand this, acknowledge it, and are hoping that shifting assets away from these retrograde industries is the first step in a more comprehensive remaking of our financial system. But in general, they lack the deep financial expertise to translate that hope into a set of tangible proposals.</p>
<p>So let's jump start that conversation, shall we?</p>
<p>At Ethical Capital, our process compels us to draw barriers of acceptability in the capital markets. That’s because some practices - like commodifying animals through the sale of furs and hides - are reprehensible enough that we place any company that engages in them on a "naughty list" and exclude them from our investment portfolios.</p>
<p>From a philosophical standpoint, it’s important that we not make these evaluations in a vacuum. Though we might be intuitively motivated to align with certain causes over others, any honest exploration of problematic corporate practices will reveal many intersecting issues that cannot be examined in isolation.</p>
<h3 id="divestment-campaigns-are-narrow-by-necessity"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/02/09/dont-stop-with-divestment/#divestment-campaigns-are-narrow-by-necessity"><strong>Divestment Campaigns Are Narrow By Necessity</strong></a></h3>
<p>Thinking broadly about these issues is contrary to the prevailing trend in sustainable asset management, which seems to emphasize picking one cause, examining its impact, and creating a portfolio that narrowly reflects it.</p>
<p>Many divestment campaigns unwittingly endorse this approach, since their advocacy is centered on a relatively narrow issue. I don’t mean to minimize the work that they do. These campaigns are profoundly mobilizing, and tend to kick-start an institution’s ability to think about sustainable investing in the way that only public attention can.</p>
<p>But it would be ideal if they could also advocate for regenerative approaches to investing that would never have bought fossil fuels in the first place. Because what happens after they win?</p>
<p>Though it might be tempting to count each institution’s divestment as a victory, it won’t amount to much in the long term if they don’t commit to reforming the mindset that led to purchasing those positions in the first place. And the only way to do that is to move into a more positive frame of mind, where the focus is on what they will do, rather than what they won't.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-do-more-than-divestment"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2022/02/09/dont-stop-with-divestment/#how-to-do-more-than-divestment"><strong>How To Do More Than Divestment</strong></a></h3>
<p>The challenge when moving from a narrow engagement to a broader, longer-term one is that it can be hard to identify what goals to work towards. It's one thing to express a vague ambition to use one's portfolio to help people and the planet, but a different thing entirely to translate that into an investment program that is capable of meeting your personal, organizational, and ethical goals.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few questions you can ask that will help identify a path forward. Whether you're managing your own money, considering the best way to make change within your university, or just trying to understand ethical investing more broadly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Who manages the money?</strong> The asset management industry has an abysmal track record when it comes to diversity and inclusion. And often, the people making actual investment decisions aren't able to benefit from a broad diversity of experiences when they set out to make investment decisions. So be mindful about who you trust, and try to team up with people who actually share your values?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is their approach to investing in climate solutions?</strong> Do your best to look past vague "vanity" metrics and get a sense of the outcomes that the companies you have entrusted your assets to are trying to create. There are countless "low-carbon" portfolios that produce little real-world impact, load up on technology stocks with questionable ethics, and try to paint themselves as champions of change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where does ethics sit in their investment process?</strong> Traditional asset managers tend to try and separate ethical questions about what they fund from standard questions around risk and return, which can lead to a confused portfolio. Asking probing questions about the role of ethics in their investment process can help to highlight whether they're really capable of adjudicating the complex moral issues that often arise in the capital markets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you decide to do, I hope you'll feel like Ethical Capital is available to you as a resource. We are committed to publishing as much useful content here as we can, and would relish the opportunity to help you in your sustainable investment journey.

<h2 id="who-owns-the-assets-under-management"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2018/02/20/who-owns-the-assets-under-management/">Who Owns the Assets Under Management?</a></h2>
<p><em>I wrote this post for CFA Institute with my friend and colleague</em> <a href="https://www.thomasbrigandi.com/"><em>Thomas Brigandi</em></a><em>. It was first published on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Say whatever you want about the world, but there's never been a better time to be an end investor.</p>
<p>Many things investment professionals fear — fee compression, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain — benefit clients through higher account balances and lower fees.</p>
<p>Asset owners are the largest of those clients. Though they are frequently lumped together as "institutional investors," they can be as different from each other as any two individuals. The only characteristic they reliably share is size, which means their goals shape the market.</p>
<p>But what exactly are those goals? What do these organizations want?</p>
<p>Thomas Brigandi and his team of more than 400 volunteers began organizing the <a href="https://www.cfany.org/cfany-asset-owner-series/">Asset Owner Series</a> at CFA Society New York in 2015 with these questions at heart. Since then, they have hosted discussions among senior investors representing over $38 trillion in assets under management (AUM) or advisory (AUA). These candid, off-the-record conversations are open only to investment professionals. They will be increasingly available to CFA Institute members <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/07/11/1042700/0/en/CFA-Society-NY-The-Hong-Kong-Society-of-Financial-Analysts-Work-Jointly-to-Expand-Asset-Owner-Series-Globally.html">globally</a> at little to no cost, but only in person.</p>
<p>Institutional investors are characterized as "big fish" and "smart money," but what else are they? Though Asset Owner Series commentary is not for attribution, the perspectives offered in these forums have removed some of the mystery surrounding these institutions, particularly the seven major types of asset owners and the motivations that are driving them.</p>
<p>Here are these "big fish" in roughly descending order of their AUM:</p>
<p><strong>1. Pensions</strong></p>
<p>Pension funds are the largest asset owners, with $36.4 trillion in AUM in 2016, according to Willis Towers Watson's "<a href="https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/insights/2017/01/global-pensions-asset-study-2017">2017 Global Pension Asset Study</a>." They fall into four primary categories:
  - "ESG Research"
  - "Sustainable Business"
- "ESG Research"
- <strong>Corporate pensions</strong> are sponsored by a single employer or several related employers within a corporate group. Many are "defined-contribution" (DC) plans, which means the plan sponsor does not bear the investment risk. The largest corporate pension plans include those of IBM, AT&amp;T, and United Technologies. Edmund A. Mennis, CFA, and Chester D. Clark's <em><a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rf.v1983.n2.4716">Understanding Corporate Pension Plans</a></em> offers a thorough overview.
- <strong>Public pensions</strong> traditionally provide public employees in the United States and Canada with defined benefits after they retire. These benefits are based on a formula, not the investment returns of the beneficiary's contributions. Mark Harrison, CFA, provided a helpful <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/05/17/lessons-from-the-canadian-public-pension-fund-model/">primer on the closely watched and widely emulated Canadian public pension fund model.</a>
- <strong>Union pensions</strong>, called Taft-Hartley plans in the United States, are operated by groups of companies together with officials of the unions that represent their workers. They are common in the building trades, trucking, retail, and mining industries. Some of the largest and most influential are the 1199SEIU Pension and Retirement Funds, Broadway League, National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT), and National Electrical Benefit Fund.</p>
<p>Pensions tend to be conservative and often rely on <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/11/21/beyond-modern-portfolio-theory-liability-driven-investment-strategies/">liability-driven investment strategies</a> to ensure that funds will be available to pay benefits when they are due. <a href="https://vimeo.com/97883297">Some have raised concerns that these funds will not be able to fulfill their responsibilities.</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Insurance Company General Accounts</strong></p>
<p>Insurance companies tend to invest the premiums they are paid in order to boost their earnings. Globally, insurance company assets totaled about $23 trillion in 2015, according to the most recent insurance indicators <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=INSIND">asset data</a> from the OECD.</p>
<p>The liabilities assumed by insurers can vary considerably in their predictability and timeframe, which leads to significant divergence in how the portfolios created to offset them are managed. Differences in regulation, product mix, and competition will play a role in the ultimate composition of these portfolios, but we can lay out some high level differences.</p>
<p>The three primary types of general accounts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: Providing health insurance creates a predictable but short-term liability with high liquidity needs. Managers of these accounts will thus keep as much as 25% of their portfolio in cash to meet these demands, and will tend to have some equity exposure to allow for long-term growth. Aetna Capital Management and CIGNA Investment Management are some of the largest organizations of this kind.</li>
<li><strong>Life</strong>: These long-term liabilities are often offset through long-term fixed income instruments, like Treasuries and corporate bonds. Managers tend to be prohibited from holding large equity allocations, so will diversify into mortgages and other assets while holding proportionally small cash balances. New York Life Insurance and MetLife are examples of large life insurance general accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Property and casualty</strong>: These insurers face "lumpy" liability streams that they offset by keeping as much as 10% of their assets in cash and 70% in bonds. They will typically blend equities and other assets in the balance of the portfolio to provide for some long-term growth. Among the large property and casualty insurance general accounts are Chubb and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Warren Buffett is perhaps the most widely known investor on the planet and <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2012/09/11/chasing-warren-buffett-alpha/">has built his impressive track record</a> in part by shrewdly managing the portfolios of insurance companies. John L. Maginn, CFA, <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/cp.v1994.n8.3">explored how these entities operated in the mid-1990s</a> in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong></p>
<p>Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are state-owned investment funds whose investable asset base is derived from a country's reserves and has been set aside for intergenerational savings, reserve management, fiscal stabilization, retirement benefits, or development. Taken together, they <a href="https://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund-rankings/">manage just over $7.5 trillion in assets</a>.</p>
<p>Most SWF funding comes from budget and trade surpluses or revenue generated from the exports of natural resources. They are generally not liability-driven investors, and as such, can adopt a long time horizon in their investment activities. Some funds have pursued innovative strategies to exploit the <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cfm.v27.n1.10">"huge advantage"</a> their unique nature affords them, while others have <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/dig.v43.n4.30">fallen prey to political pressures</a> and underperformed.</p>
<p>The roughly $900-billion <a href="http://www.china-inv.cn/wps/portal/!ut/p/a0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOL9DMwMDJ2DDbwMfB3dDBwtDFx9_Y29PL3dTPQLsh0VAbe5RsU!/pw/Z7_N0601CS0J0MAF0A80EMO3JIC03/ren/p=WCM_PI=1/p=ns_Z7_N0601CS0J0MAF0A80EMO3JIC03_WCM_Page.37c7bb2f-53b1-4742-b47e-38d857981f67=2/p=CTX=QCPchina-invQCAportalQCPhome_enQCPMEDIA_enQCPPress_Releases_en/=/">China Investment Corporation</a> is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds, and also provides an interesting case study on the mechanics of operating such a fund. The fund's chief representative, Felix P. Chee, discussed <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/cp.v28.n4.1">how the fund approaches portfolio construction and risk management</a> in 2011.</p>
<p>A more detailed case study can be found in <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/op.v2018.n1.1"><em>Multi Asset Strategies: The Future of Investment Management</em>,</a> edited by my colleague. Larry Cao, CFA. The sixth chapter details the evolution of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. The closely watched fund does not reveal its AUM, but the US State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/investmentclimatestatements/index.htm#wrapper">estimated</a> they were in excess of $300 billion in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>4. Investment Consultant Outsourced CIOs</strong></p>
<p>The majority of large investment consultants have outsourced CIO practices. <a href="http://www.pionline.com/article/20170626/ONLINE/170629919/complex-portfolios-spur-increased-use-of-outsourced-cios"><em>Pensions &amp; Investments</em>' database</a> shows total OCIO assets reached $1.69 trillion as of 31 March 2017.</p>
<p>An OCIO will often manage all or a portion of the asset owner's investment portfolio with discretion to make and monitor changes. The OCIO divisions of investment consultants differ from the core investment consulting business, which is to provide asset allocation and asset manager selection advice to asset owners. Collectively, investment consultants advise on trillions of dollars in asset owner assets under a nondiscretionary, advisory-only framework. Mercer, Russell Investments, and Aon Hewitt Investment Consultants are among the largest of these organizations.</p>
<p>Hiring one of these firms can "present significant advantages for a small fund," as they bring significant expertise in investment management and manager selection, according to Jeffrey V. Bailey, CFA, and Thomas M. Richards, CFA, in their <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rf.v2017.n3.1">primer for investment trustees.</a> Though they also warn that the model comes with drawbacks, most notably that "the natural checks and balances of standard solutions" are somewhat lacking.</p>
<p><strong>5. Single Family Offices</strong></p>
<p>A single family office (SFO) is a private company that manages investments and trusts for one family. The number of family offices in the United States has grown to more than 3,000 with total AUM between $1 trillion and $1.2 trillion, according to Capgemini's <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf">"Global State of Family Offices Report</a>. These organizations can cost more than $1 million a year to operate and thus are mostly used by the wealthiest of the wealthy.</p>
<p>The SFO's sole function is to centralize the management of a family fortune. SFO staff manage investments, taxes, philanthropic activities, trusts, and legal matters. SFOs are privately owned by high-net-worth families, so not much information on them is available to the public. Prominent SFOs include Willett Advisors, which invests the personal and philanthropic assets of Michael Bloomberg; the Heinz Family Office; and SAFO (Shari Arison Family Office) Investment Company.</p>
<p><strong>6. Endowments and Foundations</strong></p>
<p>Endowments and foundations (E&amp;Fs) are large pools of money that benefit a specific charitable cause. Endowments tend to serve educational institutions while foundations write grants for a wide range of causes.</p>
<p>In the United States, 805 college and university endowments and affiliated foundations collectively had over $515 billion in endowment assets, according to the <a href="http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/EndowmentFiles/2016-NCSE-Press-Release.pdf">2016 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments</a>. A further $865 billion is held by foundations, according to the <a href="http://data.foundationcenter.org/#/foundations/all/nationwide/top:assets/list/2014">Foundation Center's database</a>. E&amp;Fs pay out on average 4%–5% of AUM each year to their specific cause.</p>
<p>No asset owner has a longer time horizon or is able to assume greater risk. E&amp;Fs have a perpetual life and no defined liability stream, which led to the evolution of the alternatives-heavy "Endowment Model" popularized by Yale University's David Swensen. David Chambers and Elroy Dimson explored the origins and evolution of this model in a <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v71.n2.7">recent article for the CFA Institute <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>®</a>. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest foundation, while Harvard University has the largest endowment.</p>
<p><strong>7. Multi-Family Offices</strong></p>
<p>There are an estimated 150 multi-family offices (MFOs) in the United States with about $400 to $450 billion in AUM, according to Capgemini's <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf" title="Link: https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Global_State_of_Family_Offices.pdf">"Global State of Family Offices Report</a>." They provide a range of services similar to an SFO, but work with more than one family group. These services are available to wealthy clients with as "little" as $20 million in investable assets.</p>
<p>A MFO typically offers comprehensive investment solutions to affluent individuals and families, with some also handling other financial matters, including budgeting, insurance, wealth transfer, and tax services. Some notable MFOs are Bessemer Trust and Rockefeller &amp; Co.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>
<p>Many aspects of the investment landscape are set to change, but these asset owners are likely to remain at the center of the market for many years to come. So if you still have questions, Owen Concannon, CFA's <a href="https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/ind.v2015.n1.1">exploration of the asset management industry</a> may be the next place to look.</p>
<p>There's no substitute for primary sources, though, so we hope you'll <a href="https://www.cfany.org/cfany-asset-owner-series/">come meet us in person</a> at your local CFA Society to find out why.</p>

<p><em>I wrote this for CFA Institute and first published it on the Enterprising Investor.</em></p>
<p>Many people believe they know a lot about the world. My contention at the beginning of this article is a reminder: We all know much less than we think.</p>
<p>As you learn more about investing, you find the distinction between "inaccurate models" and "models" becomes more and more narrow. So with cartography. <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">The West Wing</a></em> viewers might remember chuckling at the notion of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA0BLrLW0PE">cartography playing a role in social equality</a>, and then wondering why so many different <a href="http://gisgeography.com/map-projections/">types of map projections</a> need to exist.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, you can't draw a completely accurate flat picture of a sphere. The folks at <a href="http://www.tfes.org/">The Flat Earth Society</a> would likely disagree with me, but I'm not sure their association is global enough yet to collaborate across time zones.</p>
<p>So if you feel you can draw an accurate picture of Finland and the rest of the world at the same time, you are wrong. <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CoastlineParadox.html">Good luck even measuring its coastline</a>. A country doesn't even need to have contested borders for your mental image of it to be wrong.</p>
<p>A lot of thought is focused on geopolitics these days, and it's worth remembering that some basic things are quite easy to misunderstand. But even an inaccurate picture can be useful if you approach it with humility and curiosity. Take a look at this.</p>

<p>The important question here is: is this map mostly useless or mostly useful?</p>
<p>Be kind to the elderly: it was published almost 450 years ago. But even flawed data <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994Natur.367..407R">allowed the map's author to wonder</a> whether Latin America, Africa, and Europe had once been part of the same landmass about 150 years before others asked the same question. That doesn't mean he didn't miss plenty. When I showed it to a fellow I met while working on this, he asked a great question: Where is Australia?</p>
<p>Like I said, one need not know everything in order to create value. I don't want to veer too far into the history of maps, but my first recommendation for you this week is this <a href="http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/book-curiosities-or-medieval-islamic-view-cosmos">amazing English explanation of a fascinating Arabic manuscript from the 11th century called</a> <em>Kitab Gharaib al-funun wa-mulah al-uyun</em>. Here is why you should read it: things need context. This document contains the earliest known rectangular map of the world with a graphic scale.</p>
<p><strong>Bye-Bye Cash</strong></p>
<p>If you know one thing about India's economy, you know that it just eliminated a whole lot of cash. My colleague, Ron Rimkus, CFA, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/01/17/the-mad-scientists-of-monetary-policy-the-war-on-cash/">thinks this is mad science</a>. A key reason is that demonetization can be seen as representing an affront to freedom.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">One of the best graphs of the last couple of months. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/India?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#India</a>'s currency in circulation has halved! <a href="https://t.co/icwDJ6gWyH">pic.twitter.com/icwDJ6gWyH</a></p>— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href="https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/823119093326839808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2017</a></blockquote>
<p>The reasoning in favor depends upon who you ask. Getting <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/08/india-demonetization-news-modis-black-money-move-kept-a-closely-guarded-secret.html">"black money" out of the economy</a> is one reason, but do you remember how in 2010 wealthy Athenians, in aggregate, had claimed only 324 swimming pools? Greek tax authorities decided to use satellite photos to count, and found there were <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/05/04/satellite-photos-cat.html">16,974 of them</a>. I am partial to the headline that <em>The New York Times</em> used to describe this phenomenon: "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/world/europe/02evasion.html?th&amp;emc=th">Greek Wealth is Everywhere but Tax Forms</a>.""</p>
<p>In many countries that is quite typical, but it bears mentioning that you don't need fancy cameras to see evidence of tax avoidance in India — it's about as evident as <a href="http://gothamist.com/2015/08/04/jaywalking_history_nyc.php">jaywalking in New York City</a>. In 2013, McKinsey &amp; Company <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jQBKN2vqEa0J:www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/financial%2520services/latest%2520thinking/payments/mop16_forging_a_path_to_payments_digitization.ashx+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl">estimated that India's "shadow economy" represented 26% of gross domestic product (GDP</a>). And those transactions are not taxed.</p>

<p>Here is India's Chief Economist, Arvind Subramanian, sharing the chart from his recently <a href="http://indiabudget.nic.in/survey.asp">released Economic Survey</a>. You'll note that India has a much larger taxpayer base than Greece.

<h2 id="is-alternative-intelligence-for-real"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2016/01/07/is-alternative-intelligence-for-real/">Is Alternative Intelligence for Real?</a></h2>
<p><em>This was first published by CFA Institute.</em></p>
<p>Did you know there's an artificial intelligence (AI) that can <a href="https://faces.ethz.ch/" title="Link: https://faces.ethz.ch/">decipher your age and how attractive you are</a>?</p>
<p>Other applications have been used to make <a href="http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/googles-psychedelic-ai-art-takes-twitter-by-storm">art</a> and <a href="https://www.jukedeck.com/?ref=producthunt">music</a>. And, of course, people are <a href="http://qz.com/389647/artificial-intelligence-is-the-next-big-thing-for-hedge-funds-seeking-an-edge/" title="Link: http://qz.com/389647/artificial-intelligence-is-the-next-big-thing-for-hedge-funds-seeking-an-edge/">starting to use it to make investments</a>.</p>
<p>But the AI that makes art and music can't make investments. It's a safe bet there's at least one person who is world class at all three. And that's the heart of one of the largest questions in the world right now: Is it possible to create an AI that can match a human at a broad range of cognitive tasks?</p>
<p>To be clear, this is a challenge. There's something special about human intelligence that we're not quite able to put our fingers on yet. When Garry Kasparov played chess against IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer, it was estimated that the computer was <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/541276/deep-learning-machine-teaches-itself-chess-in-72-hours-plays-at-international-master/">checking 200 million positions a second while Kasparov was checking five</a>. Kasparov won their first tournament.</p>
<p>How would that be possible if there wasn't some sort of secret sauce inside the human brain? But technology is progressing at a furious pace, and a growing group of developers are harnessing this progress to search for the secret recipe. With that in mind, we decided to ask the readers of <em><a href="https://www2.smartbrief.com/news/cfa/archive.jsp">CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief</a></em> for their opinion.</p>
<p>And, boy, did opinions vary. They should, because this is both a controversial and critical issue. That technological progress is a component of economic growth is hardly a revelation. But creating a human-quality intelligence that is native to the silicon environment of a server farm, never sleeps, and is networked to the entire world has the potential to substantially revise everything we know about how technology moves forward. Take a second and think about how such an innovation would affect your ability to find work. Just watch a relatively primitive AI <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/04/27/artificial-intelligence-has-crushed-all-human-records-in-2048-heres-how-the-ai-pulled-it-off/">play the popular smartphone game 2048</a>.</p>
<p>It's logical to think you could find a job doing manual labor. But Luke Muehlhauser, the former executive director of the <a href="https://intelligence.org/">Machine Research Institute (MIRI)</a>, says no way: "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/y9lm0/i_am_luke_muehlhauser_ceo_of_the_singularity/">Robots will be better than humans at manual labor, too.</a>""</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to create an artificial intelligence as smart as a human?</strong><a href="http://cfa-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/investor/files/2015/11/Which-of-the-following-earnings-disclosure-events-is-the-most-important-for-investors.png">
</a><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2016/01/Is-it-possible-to-create-an-artificial-intelligence-as-smart-as-a-human3.png"><img alt="Is-it-possible-to-create-an-artificial-intelligence-as-smart-as-a-human3" src="images/Is-it-possible-to-create-an-artificial-intelligence-as-smart-as-a-human3.png?resize=640%2C299"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're scared, there is some good news. A plurality (35%) of the 772 respondents think achieving human level intelligence is impossible.</p>
<p>It well may be. After all, creating music and feeling emotion are entirely different things. I'm writing this while listening to "focus enhancing" music from <a href="https://www.brain.fm">brain.fm</a>, and even though the music does do a good job of keeping me on task, it's tough to think the machine felt anything while creating it.</p>
<p>No matter how far technology advances, it may just be impossible to replicate the feeling of wonder, awe, and infinite smallness that a human being experiences while staring up at the night sky.</p>
<p>But technology is getting pretty good at faking it. Last year, a poem written by an AI was <a href="https://rpiai.wordpress.com/2015/01/24/turing-test-passed-using-computer-generated-poetry/">accepted to <em>The Archive</em></a>, a literary magazine at Duke University.</p>
<p>Given that, it's understandable why 11% of respondents believe that such an intelligence already exists. Writing a poem is still a ways away from the sort of AI depicted in <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGzRB4Pnq8">Ex Machina</a></em>, but it's definitely the sort of thing that people are surprised computers can do.</p>
<p>That element of surprise is actually one of the more interesting elements about forecasting this trend. When a technology works, we immediately take it for granted. But the last time you flew on an airplane, a computer was doing most of the piloting!</p>
<p>And let's not forget that in 1895 Lord Kelvin famously said that "Heavier than air flying machines are impossible." Speaking on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, NASA's then-deputy administrator, Frederick Gregory, declared Kelvin to have been "<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/speeches/fg_kitty_hawk_12.17.03_prt.htm" title="Link: http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/speeches/fg_kitty_hawk_12.17.03_prt.htm">slightly in error</a>".</p>
<p>I wasn't able to confirm whether he dropped the microphone afterwards. But that underscores a serious point: Declaring a technological innovation impossible is a form of hubris that invites mockery. Scientist and author <a href="http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=98">Arthur C. Clarke</a> offered a great turn of phrase: "If an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible he is almost certainly right, but if he says that it is impossible he is very probably wrong."</p>
<p>So I wouldn't advise shorting technological progress. And the balance of respondents didn't. Instead, they offered divergent forecasts for when an artificial intelligence would be developed. The second largest group of respondents (32%) believed it would happen by 2045, followed by 12% who thought it would happen by 2100. 11% believed that it would be possible, but the breakthrough would not come this century.</p>
<p><a href="http://aiimpacts.org/category/ai-timelines/predictions-of-human-level-ai-timelines/" title="Link: http://aiimpacts.org/category/ai-timelines/predictions-of-human-level-ai-timelines/">The median prediction in a survey of forecasts is 2042</a>. There are plenty of reasons to take this with a grain of salt, particularly because predicting things is very hard. But if this has piqued your interest and if you'd like to learn more, I recommend first reading <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" title="Link: http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">this excellent explainer of the state of the field at the moment</a>. If then you think that this might be a trend worth investing in, <a href="https://medium.com/@NathanBenaich/investing-in-artificial-intelligence-a-vc-perspective-afaf6adc82ea#.yf2rluff6" title="Link: https://medium.com/@NathanBenaich/investing-in-artificial-intelligence-a-vc-perspective-afaf6adc82ea#.yf2rluff6">take a look at the technology from the perspective of a venture capitalist</a>.</p>
<p>And if reading this post has got you worried about a dystopic future, read <a href="http://xkcd.com/1626/">this comic</a> and chill out a bit. It might not be that bad.</p>
