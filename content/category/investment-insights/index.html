<h2 id="cutting-interest-rates-wont-change-much"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/09/21/cutting-interest-rates-wont-change-much/">Cutting Interest Rates Won't Change Much</a></h2>
<p>I've gotten a number of questions about interest rates recently, and I assume there are more lingering in the minds of our clients and community that I haven't been asked yet.</p>
<p>So here's what I think in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Fed cut rates because the economy is weakening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It won't change the way we invest or the nature of economic value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our <a href="https://ethicic.com/how-we-invest/impact-income/">income strategy</a> is well suited for these times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think quite a few things, so here is a more extended Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>If it prompts more questions, <a href="https://ethicic.com/form-library/ask-a-question/">send them in</a>!</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What's your take on Federal Reserve interest rate policy right now? Are they heading toward a series of rate cuts?</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is and has always been data-dependent, which means they are responding to the underlying economic reality in an adaptive way. There has been some criticism that they have been a little slow to cut, but I think people need to understand that rate cuts are not something to get excited about. They're a symptom of a weakening economy! So, I expect that if we continue to see signs of developing weakness, we will continue to see cuts, but I would be shocked if they depart from that data-dependent framework.</p>
<p><strong>What was your reaction to the Fed's decision to cut rates by 0.50%, higher than the typical 0.25% reduction?</strong></p>
<p>I think they did their job. The markets would have rebelled if they didn't get some kind of concerted action and a tangible response to the criticism that the Fed has been behind the curve in the economic cycle. It doesn't really factor into the way that we view companies or the way that we see the world, except that we are grateful to have a prudent central bank that acts in a disciplined way to advance its dual mandate of managing inflation and unemployment.</p>
<p><strong>What will a rate cut (or cuts) mean for stock market investors? Any big changes?</strong></p>
<p>We've seen a rally in some of the more interest rate-sensitive, lower quality companies that tend to have a lot of debt. But for most long-term investors, it's insane to be predicating investment decisions on reading the tea leaves and trying to see what a couple of guys in Washington are going to do in the near term. The heart of building portfolios is finding fundamental economic needs addressed by good companies and owning them throughout whatever may come. That is not going to change because of an act of the Federal Reserve, no matter what the action.</p>
<p><strong>How will the rate cut impact various sectors like housing, loans, and savings?</strong></p>
<p>This is where the impact of the Fed's action is really going to be felt. A lot of loans and savings products are floating rate, which means that when interest rates change, so does the yield that savers receive and borrowers pay. I know a lot of households are feeling anxiety right now, and it's hard to imagine that a slightly lower interest payment won't be helpful at the margin.</p>
<p>On the saver's side of things, there's likely to be increased concern about how to generate income from capital. But it will remain possible, and it's important to remember that we've been through a period of really low interest rates that lasted for most of my adult life, so we will get through this.</p>
<p>On the corporate side of things, a lot of lower-quality companies have effectively gotten a reprieve from the lowering of interest rates. That's because they often carry large amounts of debt, and the reduction in interest rates flows almost directly to their bottom line. I expect that will be a relatively passing phenomenon. I don't consider that to be a way to build durable value.</p>
<p>People who are in debt, especially the most indebted folks, are breathing a small sigh of relief for sure.</p>
<p><strong>How will the rate cut affect the average American?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure the rate cut will affect the average American, but the conditions that gave rise to it certainly will. The Fed was pointing to increased risks to the unemployment outlook in their release, and it's hard to imagine that not affecting the average American. The government support during Covid led to household balance sheets that were unusually cash-rich for the United States, and that effect has largely subsided by now. The money has been spent.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, a lot of people are having a hard time getting by. We see that the most indebted folks are really having a tough time. And they're not indebted because of moral failure; they're indebted because it's hard to make ends meet.</p>
<p>That creates a precarity that tends to pervade how one sees the world. And so I think at a very deep level, every American has been affected by this underlying reality.</p>
<p><strong>Should market investors look for opportunities during a rate cut phase? If so, what stock market opportunities might work for them?</strong></p>
<p>Investors should always be looking for opportunities. That's how we keep our portfolios fresh! This is a business where you have to kill your darlings (sell positions you like) sometimes in order to stay disciplined, which means it's important to be continuously looking at what else you could own instead of only focusing on the things that you currently own.</p>
<p>We've been finding significant opportunities overseas. A lot of European industrial companies are regarded poorly by international investors, but we find that they are often very high-quality companies trading at compelling valuations with an acute appreciation of their stakeholders' needs. Over the course of the last couple of months, we've been able to upgrade and upgrade and upgrade our Growth portfolio (our flagship long-term investment strategy) to the point where it's trading at a cash flow yield that's more than five times that of our index. Those opportunities are out there!</p>
<p>We also manage an income strategy that has had a really excellent couple of months of performance by investing in preferred stocks, pools of loans, and longer-maturity corporate bonds. I expect that approach will continue to pay dividends both figuratively and literally.</p>
<p><strong>What about bank savers (CDs and money markets)? What does a rate cut or two mean for them?</strong></p>
<p>I generally don't think that long-term investors should be using bank savings products for a couple of reasons. First of all, CDs in the best cases generate rates of return that are not much higher than the inflation we've experienced. It can be riskier, but for people who genuinely are trying to put money away for a longer period of time, I think it's kind of foolish not to get the capital markets involved at least a little bit.</p>
<p>I think that's because CDs are basically contracts in which the bank wins no matter what interest rates do. If rates go up, they've locked you in at an existing rate. If rates go down, you don't get any mark-to-market appreciation from the value of your investment. All you get back is your principal instead of interest. Whereas with a bond, if you took out an 8% bond and rates went from 8% to 6%, you would be sitting on a hefty gain if the bond was relatively long-dated.</p>
<p>That's not to say bank savings products don't have a purpose, but that purpose is often to serve very specific short and intermediate-term needs, like saving for a down payment on a house or putting money that you're going to spend on tuition somewhere so it gets a little bit of yield before it gets sent out the door. Those are appropriate uses for money market funds and CDs. But I find that many bank savers I meet do not explore these other options, and they really should.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for investors concerned about falling interest rates and the impact on their investment and retirement portfolios?</strong></p>
<p>We're going to get through this. There are still ways to generate income. There are still ways to generate capital gains. Those will not change because of interest rates.</p>
<p>But with that said, a lot of investors are operating strategies that are really more mismatched collections of tactics than truly well-thought-out investment portfolios. In general, I think fretting a lot about Fed decisions, elections, or anything like that is a symptom of an underdeveloped investment strategy.</p>
<p>So anybody who's got these concerns should either call up their advisor and have a conversation or get one, because it's likely that there is a speculative element in their portfolio design that they may not even be conscious of.</p>
<p>But I mean, think about it. Interest rates were pretty close to zero for most of my adult life. This moment of real tangible interest rates has been a nice breather. But it's a departure from recent history, and I worry that it may have deceived some investors into thinking that risk-free returns exist. The reality is that they don't. Even if the risks are minimal, they still exist.</p>
<p>It can be kind of scary to hear that because it implies that we live in this very flimsy world. But I don't think that's the case. Throughout history, humans have found ways to respond to challenging situations and generate shared value in the process.</p>
<p>That basic engine is fundamentally human. It's what's behind all of the investment returns that are generated in your portfolio. That adaptive force is innate to markets, and I think understanding and appreciating it gives us a real sense of their beauty and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think the Fed's recent rate cut will impact inflation, the job market, and GDP growth?</strong></p>
<p>I think it will help keep inflation and expectations under control and provide a little bit of support to the job market at the margin. But I don't think it's going to be a material factor in driving GDP growth. That's not the point of Federal Reserve policy. They are trying to minimize inflation and control unemployment, not manage growth. There's a clear interplay between what they do and GDP growth, but it would be concerning if they began to make decisions with an eye towards short-term economic numbers.</p>

<p>We work hard to identify and invest in companies that generate positive real-world impact in the same way they generate revenue.</p>
<p>This isn't just about feeling good. For one thing, we consider companies with a positive, well-established role in a broader system to be more resilient than their competitors. They tend to be good stewards of their corporate assets, with well-established governance procedures and clear processes to mitigate conflicts with shareholders.</p>
<p>With that said, companies are social organisms with living, breathing components. Which makes it difficult to capture what makes them special with mere statistics. Fortunately, concentration is one of the hallmarks of our investment style. Which means it's possible for us to pull together brief narratives about our holdings which you can read through at your leisure.</p>
<p>This approach differs significantly from the way investment firms typically talk about impact.</p>
<p>The tendency is to produce reports which focus on a handful of issues like climate, waste, and water usage. But unfortunately, this can prevent clients and other stakeholders from developing a holistic view of how the portfolio's holdings interact with the world around them. This conventional approach can also focus your attention on data that is easily comparable and readily available, which overlooks much of the nuance of a deeper analysis.</p>
<p>Our approach has downsides too. It's more unwieldy than a slick infographic, short on portfolio-level statistics, and long on my own exposition. We are always looking to refine and improve our approach to this, so I hope you'll <a href="https://app.precisefp.com/w/ixj9du">share your thoughts</a> with us on how we can do better.</p>
<h3 id="whats-in-this-strategy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#whats-in-this-strategy">What's In This Strategy?</a></h3>
<p>We think of the holdings in our flagship <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">Global Opportunity</a> strategy as belonging to one of four verticals: Infrastructure, Innovation, Lending, and Real Estate.</p>
<p>The criteria for each is relatively straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real Estate companies generate revenue through the sale and rental of real estate,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure holdings generate revenue directly from a fixed physical asset or by selling goods and services to the operators of those assets,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation holdings generate revenue through novel products or business practices, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lending companies generate revenue by charging interest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Relative to our benchmark (The MSCI ACWI), we remain significantly underweight non-us companies at the moment, with roughly 78% of our overall holdings domiciled in the United States.</p>
<p>We are also significantly overweight Real Estate, Industrials, and Financial Services stocks, and have no current positions in the Basic Materials, Energy, Healthcare or Utilities Sectors, which are roughly 22% of our index.</p>
<p>The strategy's historical performance is shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/CleanShot-2024-06-03-at-12.28.22@2x-1-1024x515.png"/></p>
<h3 id="inside-the-verticals"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#inside-the-verticals">Inside the Verticals</a></h3>
<p>Breaking our portfolio down by industry verticals is helpful when analyzing our strategy. The table below shows some summary statistics for each of these four components, as well as their weight within the strategy overall.</p>
<p>Our focus on companies with solid business models that generate free cash flow is immediately evident from this comparison. Our strategy has more than three times the ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of its benchmark, which indicates that our holdings are extremely well-placed to make strategic investments or return capital to shareholders over the coming years.</p>
<p>Trading at roughly 60 times earnings, our Real Estate vertical might seem richly valued at first glance. We believe that current accounting earnings are not the best indicator of value for these asset-based businesses, especially in the midst of structural headwinds for the real estate industry. Our holdings are extremely well-positioned with high occupancy rates, deeply integrated into their local communities, and have been weathering the industry's recent stresses with aplomb.</p>
<p>We continue to see opportunity in each of our verticals, and our due diligence pipeline is full of high-impact lenders, innovative companies with misunderstood opportunity sets, and infrastructure investments that should benefit from significant secular tailwinds.</p>

<h3 id="top-5-holdings"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#top-5-holdings">Top 5 Holdings</a></h3>
<p>The following five companies were the largest positions. These five positions comprised 42% of our overall holdings in this strategy as of June 3rd, 2024.</p>
<h4 id="agricultural-mortgage-corporation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#agricultural-mortgage-corporation">Agricultural Mortgage Corporation</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Lending</p>
<p>Known as Farmer Mac, this Washington D.C. based lender is a remarkable example of impact in action. Its core purpose is to increase the availability of long-term credit at stable interest rates for America's rural communities.</p>
<p>The company estimates that farmers and ranchers invest $2 locally for every dollar they save on interest expenses, which means the company's impact reaches deep into areas of the country that are just plain difficult to access.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the company is focused on growing its portfolio of loans to rural electricity cooperatives, which is a profound opportunity to compound their impact over time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Farmer Mac's core financial equation is a thing of beauty. They have delivered consistent returns on equity in the high teens, and more than 90% of their revenue is recurring. On top of that, the company is well placed to serve growth markets in renewable energy, fund investments that will be necessary to increase agricultural sustainability and productivity, and deepen the resilience of our agricultural system.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="alexandria-real-estate"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#alexandria-real-estate">Alexandria Real Estate</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Real Estate</p>
<p>This Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is focused on creating and maintaining the mission-critical lab space that innovative biotechnology companies require to develop life-changing therapies.</p>
<p>It was the first REIT to adopt this focus, and roughly three-quarters of its annual revenue comes from "clusters" of market-leading lab space in key centers of pharmaceutical R&amp;D like Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, and North Carolina's Research Triangle.</p>
<p>The company's tenants were responsible for 50% of novel FDA-approved therapies in the ten years ending 2023, which is nothing if not profound impact. And to our nerdy delight, the company has won numerous awards for the quality of its disclosures and financial reports in that period as well.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-2-1024x336.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Office real estate is in the doldrums at the moment, but lab space is uniquely insulated from the industry's high-level challenges because the work that happens inside of them can't generally be done from home. The company's revenues and cash flows are growing at healthy double-digit margins, but we have been able to purchase stock at valuations unseen since the financial crisis while other investors have been fleeing the industry.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="duolingo"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#duolingo">Duolingo</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>Duolingo's mission is to provide a private tutor experience to everyone on the planet through technology. Initially focused on just language learning, they have expanded their focus to include math and music in recent years.</p>
<p>Each of these areas unlocks significant economic opportunity for the learners that participate in them. Learning a new language is arguably the single most effective way to enable an individual to improve their economic situation since communication is necessary for most forms of high value work.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the company has used its power in the language learning market to introduce a new, lower cost, and more accessible language assessment test which is displacing the legacy Test of English as a Foreign Language, or TOEFL, which is a profound additional benefit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-6-1024x576.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Duolingo is a longstanding market leader in commercializing AI for public benefit, but it has recently come under assault from short sellers after supposedly competing translation products were unveiled by OpenAI and others. We think the threats are overblown: the company's learning system is extremely difficult to replicate, has significant growth opportunities ahead of it, and has been consistently growing revenues at more than 40% a year.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="lemonade"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/05/27/what-we-own-and-why/#lemonade">Lemonade</a></h4>
<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>Lemonade is a public benefit corporation organized "to harness novel business models, technologies, and private-nonprofiit partnerships to deliver insurance products where charitable giving is a core feature."</p>
<p>That alone is profoundly innovative. But the company's management team has been incredibly creative in the way that they fund their growth plans, which adds another layer of wonderfulness to an already-exciting proposition.</p>
<p>The company's insurance products have industry-leading net promoter scores around 70, and operate closer to breakeven than most insurance industry analysts tend to recognize. As their core demographic ages, we expect they will come back to Lemonade again and again.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/122-1225602_image-lemonade-insurance-logo-hd-png-download.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> Lemonade is well capitalized with narrowing operating losses and annual revenue growth in excess of 40%. The next two years of growth should have remarkable implications for its bottom line as the company expands past breakeven, and we were able to buy in at a fifth of their IPO price.</p>

<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>
<p>This manufacturer of comfy clogs has been dismissed as a fad every year since they IPO'd back in 2006. But a look past the surface reveals an immensely innovative company that has consistently iterated on their core design to create something that is somehow both trendy and timeless.</p>
<p>The company is also well on the way towards replacing the plastic in its shoes with renewable materials, and aims to reach 50% bio-based materials by 2030. They have also rolled out a recycling program that offers discounts on new shoes to those who participate.</p>
<p>On its own, that's not so impressive. But the company has made huge strides towards enshrining comfort and utility in our popular culture, which is a significant form of impact on its own.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image-9-1024x687.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Case:</strong> The company took on a significant debt load after acquiring Heydude, a complementary footwear brand, in 2022. Though concerning, this hasn't hurt the company's solid global growth trajectory, with both brands exceeding estimates as of the most recent report. As they pay down debt and continue on their growth trajectory, we expect free cash flow to continue growing by 25% or more over the coming years.</p>

<h2 id="where-returns-came-from-in-2023"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/">Where Returns Came from in 2023</a></h2>
<p>Where are the returns coming from?</p>
<p>If I teach you nothing else, remember that question. It's one of the most important things you can ask as an investor. And if you keep asking it until you're blue in the face, you're all but guaranteed to learn something.</p>
<p>So let's look past our <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">flagship strategy's</a> handsome headline performance figure of 33.51% together.</p>
<p>The chart below shows all of the companies that we owned at one point in 2023 and their contributions to overall performance. We've used their ticker symbols in place of their names to save space. Companies that we don't own anymore as of 1/1/2024 are denoted with an asterix (*).</p>
<p>One more note before we get into this: I'm mostly talking about financial returns in this piece. A supplemental piece where we talk about the real-world impact each company generates will follow shortly.</p>
<p><img alt="Image showing the return contribution by stock of the Global Opportunities strategy in 2023" src="images/2023-Return-Attribution-Global-Opportunities-1024x466.png"/></p>
<p>I'll briefly discuss the top five contributors and detractors from performance before comparing our performance with our index.</p>
<h4 id="top-5-detractors-from-2023-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#top-5-detractors-from-2023-performance">Top 5 Detractors from 2023 Performance</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enphase (ENPH)</strong> was our single largest detractor from performance, which you might expect from a stock that was down roughly 50% in 2023. The solar power industry as a whole was a poor performer in 2023 thanks to changes in California's net metering laws that substantially reduced the industry's sales momentum. But we believe great businesses are built in downturns like these, and as long-term investors we have complete confidence in the management team led by the indefatigable Badri Kothandraraman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crocs (CROX)</strong> was the second-largest detractor from performance after momentum slowed at Heydude, a footwear brand it acquired in early 2022. This has produced a degree of financial indigestion as markets struggled to make sense of what to expect from the newly combined entity. We reduced our position during the year and cannot profess blind faith in the management team. With that said, we believe shares offer compelling value at the moment, with a ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of roughly 15%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alexandria Real Estate (ARE)</strong> was the third-largest detractor from performance as the slowing commercial real estate market affected valuations of all companies included in commercial real estate indices. But Alexandria's hyper-specialized business of providing lab space to innovative biotechnology companies can hardly be thought of as similar to mainstream commercial office buildings. We are willing to wait until the market recognizes this firm's value, and expect to be paid handsomely in the form of dividends, reinvested cash flow, and price appreciation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>American Tower Corporation (AMT)</strong> We exited this position on concerns that liabilities associated with the lead cables used to connect their cellular towers to their networks were not fully contained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HDFC Bank</strong> <strong>(HDB)</strong> This bellwether bank has significantly lagged behind the rest of the Indian stock market as it digests a complex merger process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="top-5-contributors-to-2023-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#top-5-contributors-to-2023-performance">Top 5 Contributors to 2023 Performance</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Farmer Mac (AGM)</strong> It's appropriate that our single largest position since inception would be the single greatest contributor to our portfolio's performance. Much of the reasoning <a href="https://investvegan.org/why-we-own-farmer-mac/">we shared back in January 2022</a> remains unchanged, and we have grown the position since that post to almost 15% of our ethical growth strategy. As a portfolio manager, one of my largest fears is that the market will come to recognize the value of this unique company before I can buy even more of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Duolingo (DUOL)</strong> The market afforded us the opportunity to buy into this remarkably impactful firm at a discount to its IPO price, and we did so in size. In the ensuing months, an old-school bubble in everything and anything vaguely linked to AI took hold, and the price appreciated significantly. We're no longer holding quite as many shares of this firm. But we challenge anyone to watch CEO <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration">Luis Von Ahn's 2011 TED talk</a> on the thesis for Duolingo and walk away anything but inspired and excited. Today, shares are only about 70% above their summer 2021 IPO price, and the company continues to grow revenues at a remarkably stable 40% a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TopBuild (BLD)</strong> I can't help but smile every time I think of this position, which we've held since the strategy's inception. In 2022, market prognosticators were calling for a recession, which cut the price of this insulation distributor down to half the current level because sales of insulation products are broadly seen as tied to the housing cycle. But the compelling operational footprint that this company has carefully assembled over decades combined with the real-world cost savings that good insulation offers building owners to create a wonderful financial equation as they thoughtfully consolidate their industry over the coming decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E.L.F. Beauty (ELF)</strong> This company needs no introduction for any makeup users reading this piece. They produce cruelty-free competitors to costly beauty staples at a remarkable clip, and are experiencing accelerating revenue growth as they penetrate deeper into traditional sales channels while retaining an ironclad hold on gen-z and cost-conscious consumers. The only reason it's not a larger position in our portfolios is that <a href="https://investvegan.org/our-process/">our process</a> requires us to be mindful of valuation, and the company is regularly in the most expensive decile across a range of metrics. With that said, we're likely to be shareholders for many years to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quanta Services (PWR)</strong> This company has a commanding position in infrastructure services, which includes renewable energy, communications, pipeline maintenance, and almost everything related to the electrical grid. Their approach to safety has long captivated me, and the company has been a prime beneficiary of the federal government's infrastructure spending. With a sales backlog that may be larger than their $30 billion market capitalization by now, this company is profoundly well prepared for whatever future may come.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="comparison-with-our-index"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#comparison-with-our-index">Comparison with our Index</a></h4>
<p>On the face of things, we substantially outperformed our index last year.</p>
<p>That's relatively simple to establish: The Ethical Growth strategy's 33.51% return was larger than the MSCI ACWI's 22.27% return.</p>
<p>But it's also not the most complete analysis, since many of the largest contributors to the index's returns are excluded from all of our strategies for ethical reasons. These are companies like Amazon, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nestle, Exxon, and McDonald's that generate profits for their shareholders at great cost to the rest of us.</p>
<p>To facilitate a better comparison, I cross-referenced my attribution of the MSCI ACWI's returns with our proprietary ethical exclusions library to produce the chart below. It shows that applying the same ethical exclusions to our index would have reduced the index's return to less than 15%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/2023-Benchmark-Comparison-Global-Opportunities.png"/></p>
<p>This mostly serves as a reminder that there's more to portfolio management than just removing companies with sketchy practices from your portfolio.</p>
<p>Many investment firms will represent that they are able to take your ethical criteria and apply them to portfolio management, but it's not enough to simply eliminate the companies that act badly. For best results, you need a team that is willing to truly inhabit the restricted universe that your ethics imply.</p>
<p>I'm grateful that many of you have chosen us to perform that work for you, and look forward to doing it for many years to come.</p>

<p>This firm began accepting its first client deposits almost exactly two years ago today.</p>
<p>Just like welcoming any sort of baby into one's life, the firm-rearing process has generated plenty of sleepless nights. I've spent my literal entire life as a student of financial markets, but that wasn't particularly helpful when it came time to actually run my own firm.</p>
<p>That probably sounds insane to a lot of you, but it's completely true.</p>
<p>Picking stocks is only a portion of what it takes to run this firm the right way. That's the area where my aforementioned devotion to the craft of investing provides a profound tailwind. Making good investment decisions is effectively a cumulative process, and I pull on every experience from prepubescence to the present to do it as best I can.</p>
<p>That process is all but involuntary for me at this point.</p>
<p>It's such a pure joy that it feels almost sinful. I literally schedule "spreadsheet time" when I'm feeling funky in a bad way, and it never fails to lift my spirits.</p>
<p><strong>Why would they have needed lifting?</strong></p>
<p>Because in the early months, I constantly felt like I was letting my clients down.</p>
<p>Every time it took me ten days to respond to an email, I felt like I'd failed every single one of you. Even if no-one else noticed.</p>
<p>Whenever I couldn't intuitively navigate a regulatory filing or help someone chart a course through the financial system's plumbing to transfer their assets over here, I wondered if the trust you put in me is well placed.</p>
<p>I know that I shouldn't be so melodramatic about this.</p>
<p>I try!</p>
<p>I'm constantly on the lookout for the negative patterns of self-talk that seem to emerge whenever I produce something imperfect. And that awareness has helped a lot… along with a few decades of therapy. But nothing makes me feel better than taking an incremental step towards realizing my vision for this firm.</p>
<p>Now I want you to imagine me smiling….</p>
<p><strong>We're getting there.</strong></p>
<p>Gabe and I realized recently that almost every prospective client I've met with over the past few months has decided to open an account.</p>
<p>I get it: the clients I care most about serving aren't used to being taken seriously.</p>
<p>Despite acute awareness of our many failings, I can acknowledge that we've done a great job at that from the very beginning. There are literally millions of people who don't invest at all because to them, the stock market is an inscrutable den of thieves.</p>
<p>I built this firm for them. And they're not wrong. But that's not the whole story!</p>
<p>Look past the scams, spam, and flimflam for a second, and think about how much truth needs speaking to power. I'm certain that I can only grasp a fraction of what has been left unsaid, and I think about this question a lot.</p>
<p>Here's a funny thing you may not realize: every dollar you deposit here gives this firm a teensy drop of power to shape the system that surrounds us. It's not exactly intuitive or obvious how to do that, but I have a few ideas. And I will see them through, even if it takes my last full measure of devotion.</p>
<p>To reduce the probability of such a sacrifice, I'm going to put more intention into growth over the coming year. Almost everyone who has an account here found us, not the other way around.</p>
<p>And I feel bad about that now, because there is no better partner on the planet for kind people seeking long-term ethical growth. So I'll be criss-crossing the country on Amtrak for the next few months to table at festivals, speak at a few events, and generally make our firm much harder to ignore.</p>
<p>If you know anyone that might benefit from a chat with me, Gabe, and maybe one of his cats, please know that referring them to us is the highest complement we can receive… aside from your continued willingness to share the contents of your mind with us.</p>

<h2 id="seek-perfection-elsewhere"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/07/26/seek-perfection-elsewhere/">Seek Perfection Elsewhere</a></h2>
<p>In conversation with many of you over the past few weeks, I've found myself repeating the phrase "it's unrealistic to commit to ethical perfection."</p>
<p>Given that I manage an "ethical growth" strategy and an "ethics-first" investment firm, this statement bears some explanation.</p>
<p>We invest in public markets, which typically reflect the latent desires of the wealthiest folks on the planet.</p>
<p>Overseeing our investments in such circumstances requires a commitment to creative thinking, deep research, and continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Or, to put it another way... it requires one heck of a bullshit detector.</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few quick examples of things we find regularly while examining companies that have been lauded as harbingers of a happier future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boardrooms full of billionaire buddies in their "third wife" era,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's just say "Epstein ties," and saddest of all:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams with earnest commitment to driving positive impact, but extremely slim chances of doing so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It drives me crazy to see companies like this bundled together, branded as something like the "transformative climate innovation fund," and marketed to people like you.</p>
<p>This happens because once Wall Street realized that millions of kind people actually cared about participating in the construction of a better future for the planet, the marketing machine took over.</p>
<p>At that point, it became inevitable that dreck, dross, and douchebags would pervade the sustainable investing landscape in the way they do today.</p>
<p><strong>So what can we do about it?</strong></p>
<p>I know for sure that step one is simple: refuse to make stupid promises.</p>
<p>But as far as I can tell, step two never ends.</p>
<p>That's the part where we wade through all of the grey areas, moral ambiguities, and intentional misdirections that characterize modern capitalism while keeping our moral compass intact.</p>
<p>What I hope to do in the coming weeks is start doing step three alongside it, which is where we begin giving more regular, direct, and detailed downloads on the things we've learned while working through our process each lunar cycle.</p>
<p>I hope you'll join us for our first full moon webinar this coming August 1st at 1pm. If you <a href="https://investvegan.org/gimmewebinar">click here to register</a>, you can even join the conversation directly and ask whatever questions are on your mind.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could deliver ethical perfection. But in its absence, I hope that more regular doses of our honest perspectives will suffice.</p>
