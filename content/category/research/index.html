<p>Where are the returns coming from?</p>
<p>If I teach you nothing else, remember that question. It's one of the most important things you can ask as an investor. And if you keep asking it until you're blue in the face, you're all but guaranteed to learn something.</p>
<p>So let's look past our <a href="https://ethicic.com/strategies/global-opportunitites/">flagship strategy's</a> handsome headline performance figure of 33.51% together.</p>
<p>The chart below shows all of the companies that we owned at one point in 2023 and their contributions to overall performance. We've used their ticker symbols in place of their names to save space. Companies that we don't own anymore as of 1/1/2024 are denoted with an asterix (*).</p>
<p>One more note before we get into this: I'm mostly talking about financial returns in this piece. A supplemental piece where we talk about the real-world impact each company generates will follow shortly.</p>
<p><img alt="Image showing the return contribution by stock of the Global Opportunities strategy in 2023" src="images/2023-Return-Attribution-Global-Opportunities-1024x466.png"/></p>
<p>I'll briefly discuss the top five contributors and detractors from performance before comparing our performance with our index.</p>
<h4 id="top-5-detractors-from-2023-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#top-5-detractors-from-2023-performance">Top 5 Detractors from 2023 Performance</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enphase (ENPH)</strong> was our single largest detractor from performance, which you might expect from a stock that was down roughly 50% in 2023. The solar power industry as a whole was a poor performer in 2023 thanks to changes in California's net metering laws that substantially reduced the industry's sales momentum. But we believe great businesses are built in downturns like these, and as long-term investors we have complete confidence in the management team led by the indefatigable Badri Kothandraraman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crocs (CROX)</strong> was the second-largest detractor from performance after momentum slowed at Heydude, a footwear brand it acquired in early 2022. This has produced a degree of financial indigestion as markets struggled to make sense of what to expect from the newly combined entity. We reduced our position during the year and cannot profess blind faith in the management team. With that said, we believe shares offer compelling value at the moment, with a ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of roughly 15%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alexandria Real Estate (ARE)</strong> was the third-largest detractor from performance as the slowing commercial real estate market affected valuations of all companies included in commercial real estate indices. But Alexandria's hyper-specialized business of providing lab space to innovative biotechnology companies can hardly be thought of as similar to mainstream commercial office buildings. We are willing to wait until the market recognizes this firm's value, and expect to be paid handsomely in the form of dividends, reinvested cash flow, and price appreciation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>American Tower Corporation (AMT)</strong> We exited this position on concerns that liabilities associated with the lead cables used to connect their cellular towers to their networks were not fully contained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HDFC Bank</strong> <strong>(HDB)</strong> This bellwether bank has significantly lagged behind the rest of the Indian stock market as it digests a complex merger process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="top-5-contributors-to-2023-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#top-5-contributors-to-2023-performance">Top 5 Contributors to 2023 Performance</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Farmer Mac (AGM)</strong> It's appropriate that our single largest position since inception would be the single greatest contributor to our portfolio's performance. Much of the reasoning <a href="https://investvegan.org/why-we-own-farmer-mac/">we shared back in January 2022</a> remains unchanged, and we have grown the position since that post to almost 15% of our ethical growth strategy. As a portfolio manager, one of my largest fears is that the market will come to recognize the value of this unique company before I can buy even more of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Duolingo (DUOL)</strong> The market afforded us the opportunity to buy into this remarkably impactful firm at a discount to its IPO price, and we did so in size. In the ensuing months, an old-school bubble in everything and anything vaguely linked to AI took hold, and the price appreciated significantly. We're no longer holding quite as many shares of this firm. But we challenge anyone to watch CEO <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration">Luis Von Ahn's 2011 TED talk</a> on the thesis for Duolingo and walk away anything but inspired and excited. Today, shares are only about 70% above their summer 2021 IPO price, and the company continues to grow revenues at a remarkably stable 40% a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TopBuild (BLD)</strong> I can't help but smile every time I think of this position, which we've held since the strategy's inception. In 2022, market prognosticators were calling for a recession, which cut the price of this insulation distributor down to half the current level because sales of insulation products are broadly seen as tied to the housing cycle. But the compelling operational footprint that this company has carefully assembled over decades combined with the real-world cost savings that good insulation offers building owners to create a wonderful financial equation as they thoughtfully consolidate their industry over the coming decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E.L.F. Beauty (ELF)</strong> This company needs no introduction for any makeup users reading this piece. They produce cruelty-free competitors to costly beauty staples at a remarkable clip, and are experiencing accelerating revenue growth as they penetrate deeper into traditional sales channels while retaining an ironclad hold on gen-z and cost-conscious consumers. The only reason it's not a larger position in our portfolios is that <a href="https://investvegan.org/our-process/">our process</a> requires us to be mindful of valuation, and the company is regularly in the most expensive decile across a range of metrics. With that said, we're likely to be shareholders for many years to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quanta Services (PWR)</strong> This company has a commanding position in infrastructure services, which includes renewable energy, communications, pipeline maintenance, and almost everything related to the electrical grid. Their approach to safety has long captivated me, and the company has been a prime beneficiary of the federal government's infrastructure spending. With a sales backlog that may be larger than their $30 billion market capitalization by now, this company is profoundly well prepared for whatever future may come.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="comparison-with-our-index"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/01/01/where-returns-came-from-in-2023/#comparison-with-our-index">Comparison with our Index</a></h4>
<p>On the face of things, we substantially outperformed our index last year.</p>
<p>That's relatively simple to establish: The Ethical Growth strategy's 33.51% return was larger than the MSCI ACWI's 22.27% return.</p>
<p>But it's also not the most complete analysis, since many of the largest contributors to the index's returns are excluded from all of our strategies for ethical reasons. These are companies like Amazon, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nestle, Exxon, and McDonald's that generate profits for their shareholders at great cost to the rest of us.</p>
<p>To facilitate a better comparison, I cross-referenced my attribution of the MSCI ACWI's returns with our proprietary ethical exclusions library to produce the chart below. It shows that applying the same ethical exclusions to our index would have reduced the index's return to less than 15%.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/2023-Benchmark-Comparison-Global-Opportunities.png"/></p>
<p>This mostly serves as a reminder that there's more to portfolio management than just removing companies with sketchy practices from your portfolio.</p>
<p>Many investment firms will represent that they are able to take your ethical criteria and apply them to portfolio management, but it's not enough to simply eliminate the companies that act badly. For best results, you need a team that is willing to truly inhabit the restricted universe that your ethics imply.</p>
<p>I'm grateful that many of you have chosen us to perform that work for you, and look forward to doing it for many years to come.</p>

<p>Many of our clients have significant charitable goals. This is a very heart-forward, mission-driven organization, so it makes a lot of sense that the people in our community are actively pushing positive change in multiple ways.</p>
<p>We're not able to offer the same depth of insight on charitable donations as we are with investment management, but thought we ought to share some resources to make this process a little less mysterious. After all, if you're in the early stages of forming your giving plan, it can be downright intimidating to get started.</p>
<p>Giving is best understood as a continuous practice, not a one-time check writing extravaganza. The most effective donors tend to view it as something they try to get better at over time, and often develop an intensely personal sense of what matters.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind as you read through these resources, and remember that perfection is an unrealistic goal. With that said, incremental improvements in the way you approach charitable giving can compound into outrageous real-world impact over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To start, <a href="https://www.cafonline.org/my-personal-giving/long-term-giving/giving-guide">this comprehensive guide</a> from Charities Aid Foundation highlights the three key considerations when embarking on your journey of charitable giving. It's followed by some excellent deeper-level articles <a href="https://www.cafonline.org/my-personal-giving/long-term-giving/evidence-vs-impact-finding-evidence">like this one</a>, which dives into measuring impact through evidence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping with the theme of general guides, <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/money/money-planning/charitable-donations-giving">this article</a> also provides some insight into the key questions that donors will need to ponder over. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington Secretary of State published an <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/corporations-charities/nonprofits-charities/info-donors/frequently-asked-questions-donors#2">informational page</a> on navigating the many organizations you can donate to - there are several thought-provoking FAQs here, contemplating ideas such as what percentage of donations a charity should actually put toward it's cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I personally love <a href="https://www.unitedway.org/our-impact/work/giving-old/guide-to-charitable-giving/">this piece from United Way</a> because it discusses the notion of viewing your donation as an investment. They also offer several "red flags" to be wary of when vetting the organizations you give to. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of examining the plethora of organizations out there, <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/">Charity Watch</a> is a hub full of resources for determining which groups are on the up-and-up (and which aren't). Here you can find a <em>ton</em> of information on specific charities A-Z. <a href="https://give.org/">Give.org</a> and <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/">Guidestar</a> can also be used alongside Charity Watch to form a comprehensive analysis and source different charities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you've dialed in on the specific charities you're interested in giving to, you can also use Charity Watch to sharpen your general knowledge, as they also share interesting bits on things like <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/charity-donating-articles/4-reasons-why-automated-charity-ratings-are-unreliable">why automated ratings are unreliable.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/08/25/can-the-financial-industry-help-save-the-environment/">In this piece</a>, our very own Sloane discusses the parallels between business and finance and solving social problems with Mark Tercek, investment banker turned CEO of Nature Conservancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/04/20/maximizing-your-philanthropic-impact/">in a conversation between Sloane and Eric Friedman, CFA</a>, we again learn about the importance of evidence in measuring impact. I found it absolutely fascinating (and relevant) how Eric drew comparisons between the amount of evidence present and the level of risk surrounding a giving opportunity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We truly hope you enjoy going through these materials, and that they provide some guidance in your journey. </p>
<p>We're always delighted to speak with you, so if you'd like to further discuss this (or whatever else may be on your mind), <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">please feel free to book some time.</a></p>

<h2 id="how-we-measure-investment-performance"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/05/08/how-we-measure-investment-performance/">How We Measure Investment Performance</a></h2>
<p>When I started this firm, I used an external vendor (YCharts) to measure the performance of our investment strategies. This worked well for us at the beginning, but as the firm has grown, it became clear that this was sub-optimal.</p>
<p>I had to perform numerous manual data transfer operations each month in order to produce our performance numbers. And with each passing month, I became more and more concerned that these operations were introducing errors into our reported results.</p>
<p>This isn't so relevant for our existing clients. They have always had access to accurate, up-to-date performance information calculated by Altruist, our custodian.</p>
<p>But it's important to me (and our regulators) that prospective clients have access to accurate, timely information about our investment strategies. So as of today, I'm making a material change to the way we measure and present our investment performance.</p>
<p>Please note that this change is only applicable to the <a href="https://investvegan.org/strategies/">performance we show publicly</a> for each of our strategies. If you're a client, the most accurate performance information will always be available to you directly through the Altruist web portal or app.</p>
<p><strong>What's changing?</strong></p>
<p>Each of our strategy pages now shows the performance for an actual fee-paying account that has been invested in that strategy since its inception instead of a calculated value.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you making this change now?</strong></p>
<p>Our recent hire has allowed me to spend additional time auditing our internal processes. I identified a deficiency in our existing approach and moved to correct it.</p>
<p><strong>How significant is this change?</strong></p>
<p>It's significant. We are discontinuing the practice of reporting on our real estate strategy, and restating the historical performance of our other two strategies.</p>
<p>The table below shows the cumulative performance of our Veda Ethical Growth strategy calculated under the new methodology and the old methodology from October 2021 through March 2023, when the old methodology was discontinued for this strategy. Both the new and old calculations include all applicable fees.</p>
<figure>

| **New Calculation** | **Old Calculation** | **Benchmark** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \-5.76% | \-6.09% | \-6.91% |

<figcaption>

_Performance of the Veda Ethical Growth strategy from Oct 2021 to March 2023_

</figure>
<p>The change also applies to the Veda Integral portfolio. Please note that this table covers a different time period than the one above. I've included returns from the benchmark in these periods in the hopes that it better calibrates your understanding.</p>
<figure>

| **New Calculation** | **Old Calculation** | **Benchmark** |

| 7.05% | 4.77% | 2.18% |

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I would not presume to decide whether this change is significant on your behalf. Instead, I've presented the old and new calculations for each month of each strategy at the end of this post. And like, created a whole blog post about it so that you can dig into the reasoning, examine the practical implications, and decide whether or not to move on with your life.</p>
<p><strong>Will the way investment performance is calculated change again?</strong></p>
<p>Over time, I hope to converge the approach we use with the <a href="https://www.gipsstandards.org/">Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)</a> promulgated by CFA Institute. Attentive readers will remember that I used to work at that organization, and can probably imagine that I continue to hold its standards in high regard.</p>
<p>If I see an opportunity for us to move towards compliance with these standards without compromising our ability to accept clients with no investment minimum, I will seize it. However, in the meantime I have attempted to strike a practical balance between complexity, accuracy, and timeliness.</p>
<p><strong>I've got questions about this. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Reach out to me directly! You can either <a href="mailto::sloane@investvegan.org">send me an email</a> or <a href="https://calendly.com/ethicalcapital">click here to schedule a meeting</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/">Why We Need A New Food System Now</a></h2>
<p>Today's supply chain snafus might be setting the stage for a broader, more complex catastrophe in the global food system. The availability of potash, phosphate, and fossil fuel derived agricultural inputs that we rely upon to feed earth's growing populations has already been materially reduced, and these stresses could take as long as 3-5 years to resolve.</p>
<p>The timeline comes from to <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterZeihan">Peter Zeihan</a>, an analyst I've been following for close to a decade for his sharp views on geopolitics, energy, and international trade. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeihanonGeopolitics">His YouTube channel</a> is free, and has been illuminating during Russia's recent war of aggression, so I took the opportunity to dig a little deeper into how his views intersect with something that should be of interest to everyone on the planet: our food system.</p>
<p>He would probably want me to underscore one point at the outset of this exploration: <strong>modern agriculture is an industrial process</strong>. It's true that regenerative approaches are growing in popularity, but at the moment only about 5.5 million of the United States' roughly 900 million acres of farmland is certified organic. That's well under one percent.</p>
<p>So as a practical matter, synthetic fertilizers are currently supporting about half of the world's population.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the world population that our current food system can support with and without synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Approximately half of the people on earth rely on unsustainable synthetic fertilizers to survive. " src="images/world-population-with-and-without-fertilizer-1024x723.png"/></p>
<p>The chart above is stark enough before we pause to consider that supply chain disruptions (and the most acute threats to food security) are not evenly distributed around the world.</p>
<p>North America is unique in that we have plentiful sources of potash, phosphate, and natural gas in close proximity to our midwestern "breadbasket." Only a few other places in the world are so fortunate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eighty percent of global potash production comes from Canada, China, Belarus, or Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China, Morocco, and the United States produce two thirds of the world's phosphate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Russia and the United States are the world's two largest producers of natural gas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed that Russia featured twice in that list. Both Mr. Putin's Petrostate and allied Belarus are now subject to sanctions, which effectively takes a non-trivial portion of the market offline.</p>
<p>It's too soon to tell what this will mean exactly, but just a few days ago the Interim Chief Executive of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/canadas-nutrien-sees-possible-prolonged-global-fertilizer-disruption-russia-2022-03-01/">Nutrien, the world's biggest fertilizer producer, said</a> "We are going to run our plants. Run them flat out. Could we see interruptions in exports out of Russia? Yes. Can we see plant closures? We could."</p>
<p>Such a disruption would be poorly timed, since the northern hemisphere's temperate agricultural regions will be in the full bloom of spring before too long. And fertilizer only works if you put it on the plants before they grow. So in the short term we're left hoping that these shipments can make it to their destinations.</p>
<h5 id="the-food-system-is-unsustainable-at-best"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/#the-food-system-is-unsustainable-at-best">The Food System is Unsustainable at Best</a></h5>
<p>Of course, it bears mentioning that <strong>none of this is remotely sustainable</strong>.</p>
<p>For one thing, potash, phosphate, and fossil fuels are not renewable. They need to be extracted, transported, refined, and then transported again to reach their final destinations.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, they also have an unfortunate tendency to leach into groundwater and literally strangle waterways with out-of-control algal blooms. But even if those negative effects could be contained, farmers would still need to keep spending substantial sums re-applying these treatments every year. And their soil wouldn't be any better off after all of the expense and complexity involved.</p>
<p>Farmers will do their best to adapt. Some might stop planting corn in favor of soy, which needs less fertilizer to grow than conventional cultivation methods. They might even take steps towards adopting regenerative practices by using manure in place of expensive fertilizers.</p>
<p>But that won't help the folks in the global south who are already facing food insecurity.</p>
<p><img alt="Inequality in per capita calorie intake in 2020 by country. This shows that the global south is profoundly more exposed to disruptions in food supply than the rich world. " src="images/coefficient-of-variation-cv-in-per-capita-caloric-intake-1-1024x723.png"/></p>
<p>It's hard to pinpoint where on the planet these pressures will manifest, but one can safely and sadly assume that the darkest-tinted countries in the map above are set to carry most of the weight.</p>
<p>This is a policy choice. And delaying our adaptation leaves many vulnerable populations around the world needlessly exposed to famine.</p>
<p>Even if we were to forget how to make synthetic fertilizer, we could still adapt our agricultural system to feed everybody on earth and entirely mitigate the risk of famine by phasing out animal agriculture. This <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets">would free up 75-400% of the land currently in agricultural use</a> (depending on the way you measure), substantially reduce humanity's carbon footprint, and prevent billions of living, thinking creatures from experiencing needless suffering.</p>
<p>It would also create a much more resilient economy, since we wouldn't have to worry about geopolitical tensions spilling over into famine with the same sort of urgency. The expensive, complicated, and non-renewable inputs that are pushing us towards that extreme situation this time around would be replaced by manure and compost, which can be generated locally.</p>
<h5 id="can-we-accelerate-this-transition"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/03/why-we-need-a-new-food-system-now/#can-we-accelerate-this-transition">Can We Accelerate This Transition?</a></h5>
<p>We can sure try. But it will be a complex undertaking, and it's important to make sure that you've given yourself the space and support to take on this kind of challenge. True change starts from within, so this can be as simple as making an authentic commitment to try your best and follow any resulting instincts.</p>
<p>If you do only that, I believe it can make a world of difference. After all, that's basically how I wound up starting this firm, which has allowed me to help others build financial security for themselves by aligning their capital with companies that are driving positive change in the world.</p>
<p>A little more than 16% of our flagship investment strategy is invested in companies that are making our food system a little bit better and more resilient every day. They do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making low-cost loans available to family farmers and sustainable electric cooperatives,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuing cutting-edge research into synthetic biology, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing early-stage capital to the next generation of agriculture and food-tech startups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's very, very cool that we're able to make a professionally managed portfolio of companies like these available to almost anyone who can open an American brokerage account, regardless of how much money they have available to invest.</p>
<p>But I hope to compound my firm's impact even further by sharing our thoughts openly and regularly through missives like this one. If you've enjoyed it, <a href="https://ethicic.com/reach-out/">say so!</a> I would love to hear from you.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-inflation-mean-to-you"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/">What Does Inflation Mean to You?</a></h2>
<p>Inflation has been an obscure economic phenomenon for most of my life. There has been plenty of academic discussion, but it hasn't crossed over into mainstream economic and political discourse.</p>
<p>Until recently.</p>
<p>Pandemic-induced supply chain shocks have coupled with Russia's war of aggression and the associated volatility in world energy markets to put it front and center in "kitchen table" economic discussions.</p>
<p>Which is a polite way of saying that people are worried about it.</p>
<p>I can see why.</p>
<p>Traditionally, analysts ignore inflation in energy and food prices (which are quite volatile) and focus on "core inflation" which is designed to measure the other stuff in our day to day life. Things like medical care, apparel, education, and services.</p>
<p>As the chart below from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm">United States Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> shows, those prices have spiked after almost two decades of stability.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/12-month-percentage-chan-1024x761.png"/></p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>And more importantly, how can we expect it to manifest in the broader economy?</p>
<p>There is no shortage of scary stories about the ravages of inflation. Countries like Zimbabwe, Argentina, and Turkey have been indelibly shaped by it for most of the period shown in the chart above. We've heard of people who make a habit of going to the grocery store first thing in the morning because prices increase every afternoon and princes made into paupers by the mass devaluation of currency.</p>
<p>Is that what we have to look forward to?</p>
<p>At a high level, <strong>I don't think so.</strong></p>
<p>And I think that the general discussion about inflation in our economy has obscured some basic questions of fairness that should be of interest to anyone with a progressive political bent. But I want to make sure that we're all on the same page. So let's clarify some terms before we dive into what we can reasonably expect in the future.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#what-is-inflation">What is inflation?</a></h3>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines inflation as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not so complex! Prices up, value of money down. But a declining value of money doesn't exactly create warm and fuzzy feelings in anyone's hearts. Instead, it tends to create panic, since most people aren't used to thinking of the dollars in their wallet as something that fluctuates in value.</p>
<p>That's because unless you're sending money overseas, traveling, or making a big-ticket purchase from another country, fluctuations in the value of the dollar don't mean very much to you. They show up in the price of things you buy day-to-day, but generally speaking the fluctuations outside of food and energy prices are digested by the time they reach you that you barely perceive them.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-inflation-measured"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#how-is-inflation-measured">How is inflation measured?</a></h3>
<p>In the United States, the benchmark measure of inflation is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They've created a metric called the <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong>, which is designed to measure the prices that consumers pay for certain goods and services.</p>
<p>It's important to underline that we're talking about consumers as a whole here, not you in particular. For instance, vegans have generally been insulated by recent rises in the price of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. So our personal experiences of inflation may be quite different from what's described in the CPI.</p>
<p>That's doubly true for folks who live outside of big cities. The CPI is designed to measure price changes for urban consumers, and doesn't generally do a good job tracking the experiences of people in Rural America who often have lower incomes, greater day-to-day reliance on oil and gas, and labor markets that are slower to adjust for rising wages.</p>
<h3 id="is-inflation-good-or-bad"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#is-inflation-good-or-bad">Is inflation good or bad?</a></h3>
<p>Inflation is just one component of our economic ecosystem, which makes it difficult to analyze in isolation. With that said, many economic commentators have not hesitated to characterize it as a scourge. That's because it reduces the value of certain assets, like cash held in bank accounts, in a way that's quite scary to seniors and other folks who live on fixed incomes.</p>
<p>But it also creates jobs. It's not a coincidence that inflation is flaring up at the same time as the US unemployment rate is drawing closer to pre-pandemic levels. This relationship is so central to our economy that the US Federal Reserve's mandate is to promote both "maximum employment" and "stable prices."</p>
<p>This effectively acknowledges a direct link between the recent "great resignation" which has featured all sorts of employees leaving their jobs for better pay, more flexibility, or long-term career opportunities and the rise we've seen in inflation rates. One begets the other. So it would be quite difficult to issue an accurate blanket characterization of it as good or bad because at some level, it's both.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem to stop people.</p>
<p>There seems to be an army of right-wing zealots ready to pounce on every inflation-related datapoint in an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the long-term stability of our economy. In many cases, these pundits have been making the same case for years without regard to the evidence. And in my judgment, you would be well served by ignoring them. A well-diversified portfolio of stocks (such as the sort that we build for our clients) is widely seen as the best way to preserve the value of your wealth over long time horizons.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-relationship-between-debt-and-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#whats-the-relationship-between-debt-and-inflation">What's the relationship between debt and inflation?</a></h3>
<p>The mainstream discussion about inflation tends to overlook something crucial: many Americans are in significant amounts of debt. I'm talking less about mortgages here than credit cards, student loans, and medical debts that often come with high interest rates and target some of our poorest populations.</p>
<p>This probably doesn't come as news, since at this point almost everyone has a friend or loved one that has been touched by this personally. A recent <em>Liberty Street Economics</em> <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/11/uneven-distribution-of-household-debt-by-gender-race-and-education/">analysis</a> published by the New York Federal Reserve found that Black, Hispanic, and Female college graduates were much more likely than other graduates to still be carrying student loan debt at age thirty.</p>
<p>This means that those graduates effectively had their earnings reduced by the cost of carrying their student loan debt. And because inflation reduces the cost of paying back those debts, its recent rise may wind up reducing the burden that these borrowers are set to bear in the coming years.</p>
<p>Of course, it's nothing compared to just cancelling the loans outright or enacting broader-scale economic justice reforms. But we'll have to leave those topics for another time. Feel free to reach out to us if you don't feel like waiting, though.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-best-way-to-protect-my-assets-from-inflation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2022/03/01/what-does-inflation-mean-to-you/#whats-the-best-way-to-protect-my-assets-from-inflation"><strong>What's the best way to protect my assets from inflation?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Most well-diversified portfolios are designed to protect the value of your assets over time, but some do a better job of that than others. As a general rule, companies with strong pricing power are the best situated to navigate an extended inflationary environment. Investments in tangible assets, like real estate and infrastructure, should also be expected to hold up well.</p>
<p>The strategies we manage here are designed with this in mind, and tend to hold larger-than-average concentrations of real estate and electric utilities. Our due diligence <a href="https://ethicic.com/our-process/">process</a> also evaluates a company's degree of pricing power, which is a fancy way of saying that we take inflation extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Anyone concerned with inflation should also consider owning some I Bonds. Issued by the US Treasury, these are special savings bonds that automatically adjust their interest rates to account for inflation. That means that whether inflation rises or falls, you can rest assured that your I bond holdings will retain their purchasing power.</p>
<p>The primary drawback with I Bonds is that you can only purchase $15,000 worth of them in each calendar year. They also withhold a few months of interest if you sell the bonds within five years of purchase, but the yields are so much better than most other savings products that they are still a compelling option for many use cases.
